And THAT was great except that I do n't ever watch 830 of those channels.In order to `` delete '' the channels that you do n't watch , you have to check them off and delete them one at a time . This would rate 5 stars plus if there was a way to block , say channel 300 through 699 and delete them . After that , there 's another group of 200 channels , and then I would n't mind picking out individual channels.Right now , even after some selection , when I want to see what 's on at 9 PM , I 'll get a list of 400 programs.Now , if that app would like to go a step further , I 'd like to be able to delete individual programs that I will never watch ... like Tivo ."}, "98": {"id": "97", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "LOVE LOVE THIS APP. ! ! ! ! !

That way you can quickly search for those several different types of items.I am giving this App five stars , but there are a few improvements that I would LOVE to see .

I typically play with my KF in portrait position . I 've tried landscape ; it works perfectly , but it 's just not to my taste . The highlighting of completed row/box is useful . Highlighting `` all number N used '' is extremely helpful , but having the display flash in different colors takes a bit of getting used to.The user controls are OK : - Entering choices using the box-first approach is intuitive . Entering number-first-then-box is claimed to be faster , but again , it takes some getting used to . ( Because of the highlighting feature , I 've not been able to get used to it because of the way the colors change back and forth . ) - The undo/back-track command is really great . I have n't yet found how deep the undo stack is , but I 've exercised it pretty well , I think.- I 've used the rotate/mirror commands only once , but the change of viewpoint enabled me to finish a `` fiendish '' ( toughest level ) puzzle . Bravo.- I have yet to figure out what other command buttons do - from my perspective , ES behaves just a tad strangely when some buttons are pressed . I suppose I should read the manual , but a perfect app is written so all controls are intuitive.A truly strong point of ES is the range of available daily games : there are FOURTEEN levels , ranging from trivial to , well , really really ( near impossibly ) hard . Winner , winner , chicken dinner . There is a slight discontinuity in difficulty : the game takes a big jump somewhere around `` moderate '' or `` intricate . '' I can live with that . Starting over does n't impact time-to-complete scoring ( I 'm divided on this one ) .At the end of a game , you get some feedback with a rough percentile chart . Sorta informative .

I believe they like to try to get help known as lost souls . I use the free version of this whenever I get the chance . There are over 10 different responds I got that makes me believe its real . I do n't remember all ten but I remember my first one . I was in my reclining chair and opens the app , I put Mt blanket on and was relaxed , it then said comfortable . I was like ok , was n't too impressed . then I went to lay back and it said relaxed . I thought ok 2 fluiks . I went to close my eyes and it said rest . I almost threw my kindle on the ground amazed at what I heard and saw . I told my family that lives with me and they said it might be real . So I went to breathe and the room was n't cold , but I saw my own breath , then it said hello .

Hexage is known for stunning visuals and innovative game-play twists on strategy genres , and they do not disappoint on this title . I also feel that this game has not received enough credit on its Amazon port , as very few people know about it . In an attempt to give an accurate and easy to view review , here are the pros and cons of the puzzle game `` Totemo HD '' : Pros -*Great Visuals - The graphics in `` Totemo HD '' are what puts this puzzle game over the top for me . On the Kindle Fire HD , the visuals are breathtaking due to its usage of the High Definition version . The background visuals , the menu screens , and the spirits themselves bring an eerie feeling to this puzzle game . I would say that these visuals bring a feel reminiscent of the zen puzzle game `` Quell '' . Your `` guide '' and narrator of the game ( the totem man ; traveling between worlds ) is very vibrant and again adds to the ghastly feel of the game . *Easy Controls ; Difficult Game - `` Totemo HD '' paces the game well as you begin to play it by matching the `` spirits '' in pairs of various numbers ( 2 , 3 , ect . ) in vertical or horizontal lines . It may seem simple , but the addition of other barricades such as star spirits add to the complexity . Some levels are insanely hard and challenging , which I feel is much better than hundreds of easy levels . The 100 levels in this game will keep you going for a while , and the challenge makes it worthwhile in comparison to some puzzle games that are just too easy for a majority of the time . *Great Accompaniment Soundtrack - The Kindle Fire HD 's Dolby Digital Plus sound system seems to make great use of Hexage 's soundtrack in their games , and the eerie sounds of `` Totemo HD '' add to the general feel of the game . With the visuals and music , it creates a wonderfully surreal puzzle playing atmosphere . *Survival Mode - On top of the 100 levels of puzzles , a survival mode pressures you to complete endless amounts of puzzles quickly to keep going , and an online leader board makes this even more enjoyable.Cons -*HD Only ( ? ) - As I have a Kindle Fire HD , I have no problem with paying $ 1.99 to get a stunning HD puzzle game , but I think this may be a negative aspect for regular Kindle Fire users as `` Totemo HD '' is the only version of the game in the Amazon App store . Regular Kindle Fire users will not be able to use the HD aspect of this game , sadly , and I would suggest if possible , Hexage , to put a regular port of the game on the marketplace . *Possibly Short - `` Totemo HD '' currently has 100 levels . I have heard that it previously had only 62 , and I am glad that Hexage expounded on the number of levels . To many , this seems to be too few levels , but the difficulty of them ( starting VERY early on ) makes it longer than one may expect . Even so , I ca n't imagine this game taking too long for people to beat , but I would recommend playing survival mode or the story again . *No hints - There is no hint system or `` pay-to-proceed '' system using either real money or in game currency ( as there is no in game currency ) . This may turn some people off , since the levels are difficult . For me , this was n't a problem.Conclusion - '' Totemo HD '' is a puzzle game that is hard to pass up . It 's challenging , beautiful , and the soundtrack is great for doing these puzzles . I highly recommend this game , and I feel it has gotten far to little recognition on the Amazon Appstore . Check this game out , even if you are only a casual puzzle gamer ."}, "1007": {"id": "1006", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is a fun logic game that I installed on a whim to keep my daughters ( 12 and 7 ) entertained .

It does all it says . Cloud play is great . I read some ppl claiming that their music got lost . If this is the case for u make sure when buying ur music it was saved to the cloud drive . All music bought from amazon is free to store in the cloud and unlimited . However uploaded music is limited to 5gb which is quite small . So when choosing b/w Google Music and Amazon that 's something to consider . Both players are equally good . I think the deciding factor here is where you have bought more music . personally I have bought more from Amazon BC of the $ 5 alblums which are cheaper than what Google sells music for.1annoying thing is the app does emphasize the store part of the app as much as the player .

If that 's not the one you want , you have to toggle again.I started with the kids mode just to sample the interface and game play . So far so good . It 's not a true RPG . You advance a level ( dungeon ) by making words . The higher the value of the word the more destructive it is against the level 's monster . Each fight depletes some of your health . When out of health the game ends.Final word : be skeptical of low ratings . The player probably did n't spend much time playing the game .

It 's a mix of a lot of things to keep you preoccupied . It 's a bit like scrabble , where you are given a set of letters to make words in order to 'defend yourself ' after you have been attacked by mice , skeletons , etc . You face these beings in dungeons , and these dungeons are shown on a World Map . The map shows where you are , and how many dungeons you will have to go through ( which are a lot ) .You are able to choose your own game mode , and these are your options : Kid Mode - starts with extra health , words do double damageNormal - Standard RulesWizard - Experts only ! Starts on Dungeon 4 . No oracle tilesYou really have to get creative with the words , for you can not use the same word twice ( it seems ever ) , so I can see this being a perfect game for a person really into puzzles.For me personally it was a pretty good game , but I do n't think I would get through the entire map in one sitting . It 's definitely something for me to check into every once and a while when I 'm bored , because it is a challenging game , it 's just a tad redundant.However , once you amass a certain amount of points there are extra squares you are given that have powers that play to your advantage ( like a healing one , extra points , oracle eye that creates the best word out of all your letters , etc etc ) .But I love the added paranormal-ish element to it - it 's not just a regular word game . There are probably added features that I have n't gotten to ( I 'm on the fifth dungeon right now ) , so I ca n't wait to see what else is offered .

It does seem to get challenging in a hurry , but that is okay with me because it last about the right amount of time for playing . I am happy that it closes when you exit the game .

Back then , it was easier and cheaper to convert the books to CD than to get an MP3 player with enough capacity to hold a whole book . But that 's a whole other story.Pretty much , I love the app . It syncs up just fine , loading in all the books in my library that I have bought over the years . I can shop directly from the app , so I can grab a new title while on the road . I like that I can start listening even before a book download is completed , especially given the size of some of them . The app offers several sorting methods , plays just fine in the background , and I have yet to have it crash on me . The color scheme works well , easy to read . The 30 second reverse button is handy , especially if a loud vehicle or some other distraction comes along and drowns out the sound . When calls come in , it pauses nicely and resumes when I end the call.There are two things I do n't care for however , which is why the app only gets four stars instead of 5 . One is that it does n't seem to always remember what it was doing last . If I pause the playback , exit the app , then come back , it may and may not remember what it was doing at the time . When it does n't remember , it puts me back at the main library menu , leaving me to scroll back to the book and part that I was listening to . It always remembers where in the book/part I left off at least . The second thing is the interaction when I get a notification . The notification tone overrides the app , causing me to miss whatever was said for the duration of the tone .

It 's kind of an insult for them to think us so dense that we would n't be able to tell those reviews are written by the developer and are obviously all by the same person . Wow !

Is a clever variation of the old plastic sliding block puzzles that I loved to play as a kid . With those puzzles , you typically had a 4 x 4 grid with all but one of the squares filled with blocks that had some design or number on them ; the goal was to rearrange the blocks to meet a certain end configuration . In Move it ! the goal is to move the large red block into the shaded target square.There are six levels : novice , casual , standard , difficult , advanced , and expert , with a total of 150 puzzles . There 's also a short tutorial . You can toggle the music and sound effects on or off , but I liked the simple guitar music if the volume was turned down a bit.The mechanics of the game are very simple to learn , but winning gets progressively more difficult as you advance . Mercifully , there 's an undo button that will undo as many moves as you want to take back . Holding the button down for a second will reset the puzzle . If you 're hopelessly stuck , from the menu bar at the bottom of the screen , press `` View Solution , '' and you can see a move-by-move solution.I enjoyed solving ( or trying to solve ) the puzzles . They get pretty challenging after the first few , but it 's a great exercise in analyzing and solving spatial relations.I played Move it ! on my Kindle Fire , and it installed and ran perfectly .

Although there ate not to many uses for this type of app , when the do arrive it is nice to have an easy to use app to provide these answers.I do feel the need to take away some points for the number of bugs this app has.1 . The date calculator has no way to trigger the update of the target date after you enter values into the day/week/month/year fields . Instead I am forced to toggle the +/- buttons in order to get it to calculate.2 . A design flaw with the date calculator is that once you enter values in the fields the labels ( in the fields ) disappear . So there is no visual clue on which box is for which field.3 . Several of the apps pages do not provide a wide enough scroll wheel for the day portion of the date selector . This results in a display of 10 1 's and 10 2 's since the first digit is all that gets displayed.So although these bugs are annoying , they either occur on parts that I wo n't use much anyway or have an easy enough work around.UPDATED 6/11/2012With exception of the the second issue I reported ( not being able to see what entry fields are for what value once you enter something ) the other issues have been resolved.The +/- buttons trigger the app to recalculate and it does n't require toggling as I previously mentioned.The date selector is now using a cleaner interface to scroll through the date pieces and it works consistently now.Given those adjustments , and the fact the the developer took time to read , reply and react to reviews like this makes me change the rating from 4 to 5 stars ."}, "1796": {"id": "1795", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I like the idea of this application very much .

I asked myself how other , more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly . `` Application Folder Pro '' , my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management . Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that 's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface , the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort . In my case ( XOOM , Honeycomb ) they do n't . I was n't able to justify allowing a `` vendor 's '' app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it , just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it . And , on a more parochial note , dxTop was stuck in 'portrait ' on my XOOM . There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate ' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives ' , this does appear to be a well-thought , well-designed overlay but it 's a radical departure from Android 's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was : if they believe that Android 's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out , why not produce their own mobile OS ?

Unfortunately , when I buy an ebook on Amazon , I 'm locked in to their apps/devices , so I ca n't read the book the way I want . Amazon is n't doing me a favor by making an ebook app that works for me , they owe it to me.Margins : When I read a physical book , there are reasonable margins . When I read a DRM-free ebook on a feature-rich open source e-reader app on my galaxy tab , I have reasonable margins between the edge of the screen and the edge of the tablet . When I read a Kindle ebook on the Kindle app on my galaxy tab , I have EXTRA LARGE margins in portrait mode thanks to the built in , non-configurable software margins . When I tilt the tablet a few degrees too far to the right or left ( surprisingly easy to do when you have the tablet tilted back a little ) , I get EXTRA LARGE margins on the top and bottom of the screen , and DELUXE SUPER JUMBO margins on the right and left.Screen Rotation : On my phone , the Kindle app is great . The software margins are n't an issue since my phone does n't have built in margins around the screen , and I can tell the Kindle app not to change orientations when I tilt the phone by pressing a mysterious lock icon that appears when I tilt it . On my tablet , the Kindle app team has decided that users do n't like locking the screen rotation , so they 've completely removed that feature . They say that it 's easy to lock the screen rotation in Android 3.0 , but it 's actually only one click less to lock the screen in Android 3.0 than to lock it in Android 2.X , plus there 's the fact that I do n't want to have to enter Kindle App Mode every time I try to read a Kindle ebook.The only reason I 'm giving it two stars rather than one is because the Kindle app is still at least twice as good as the Barnes and Noble Nook app , for what it 's worth ."}, "2113": {"id": "2112", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "The quality of the audio is excellent - selection process is impossible.Ca n't figure out how to turn off the station that is streaming .

An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone , whether a call is active , the number that call is conncted to and the like . * Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage . Allows an application to write to the SD card . * Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator . * Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks . * view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi . ( network comm . ) Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a `` car version '' of the Block Me game , especially the Market 's PAID version . The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions , so in the paid version , you 're paying for `` more game '' and not `` less/no ads . '' The developer clearly does n't care about giving you more `` game '' for the money , because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon . He knows asking for your phone 's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call , and who called you , are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining . So he takes it out ... . but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful `` leaderboard action '' and `` rate this app '' and `` notify me of bugs '' stuff , as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they do n't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app , what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD , what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to ( even WITHOUT the phone serial number request ) , why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one ( for now ) , and what he 'll likely do to update YOUR app once he 's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back , just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here , for instance the `` paid '' version of Bubble Popper . The permission for the phone is IN there , even in that PAID version.P.S . Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why , especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia .

( This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is ) .Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH ... .SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad ; yeah , I ( now know that I ) should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists ( not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create , port , etc . ) .Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime . ( I do n't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi ) .When I 'm on a road trip- it 's my bandwidth that 's used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs , and I do n't need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I 'm at home , fine.But it simply does n't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home , with selections , playlists , etc . already set up.What do I gain here by using this app ?

'' I AM RECEIVING EMAIL WITH LINKS INTENDED FOR ANOTHER CUSTOMER NAMED `` SHARMONIQUE '' ! ! ! ! ! ! ! __________________________________SUNDAY , OCTOBER 16 , 2011 , 1:00 PM : __________________________________PAGEONCE has signed me up and installed the Beta BillPay program module into my account even though I DID NOT AGREE TO IT in the survey email they sent ! The `` survey '' stated ( at the end ) `` put your name and email address in and click 'send ' to join the Beta program . '' I NEVER DID THAT AND I BACKED OUT OF THE EMAIL ! I AM VERY CONCERNED because today , SUNDAY , October 16 , 2011 , I received an email from PageOnce that began `` DEAR SHARMONIQUE ... '' and my name IS NOT SHARMONIQUE . I immediately emailed PageOnce at the email address given because of my concern with someone else 's email being sent to MY email address with LINKS in it to activate the BillPay ! A few minutes later , I decided to open MY PageOnce account , and LOW AND BEHOLD , it goes RIGHT TO THE MAIN SCREEN just like usual ( not notices , install , nothing ! ! ) WITH NO DOWNLOADING ON MY BEHALF OF ANYTHING , nothing ... . then as usual , I click on the little square that shows you the bills coming due . And then I noticed something to my HORROR ... .. Next to each bill listed was a little green icon that you could click that said `` PAY . '' I could n't BELIEVE THIS ! NOW I HAD THE BETA BILLPAY PROGRAM INCORPORATED INTO MY NORMAL PAGEONCE ACCOUNT AND NEVER GAVE PERMISION FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ! I tried to be a nice person and answer their survey they sent by email several days ago , which asked what features you `` would '' like should a bill pay program be available , and I STOPPED AT THE VERY END OF THE SURVEY WHERE IT SAYS `` PUT IN YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AND NAME TO SIGN UP FOR A BILLPAY PROGRAM WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE . '' I backed CLOSED THE EMAIL ( AND , HENCE , THE SURVEY ) AND NEVER AGREED TO JOIN THE BETA PROGRAM . And here it is , several days later , I get SOMEONE ELSE 'S EMAIL WITH LINKS IN IT TO ACTIVATE BILLPAY addressed to a person THAT IS NOT ME . Why did PageOnce SIGN ME UP when I never gave persmission ? Is Sharmonique 's account now MINE ? And does SHE now have MY ACCOUNT ? ? I CALLED IMMEDIATELY TO THE TOLL-FREE NUMBER FOR PAGEONCE this morning as soon as I saw my app had BILLPAY ON IT with , AT A GLANCE , had MY FULL ACCOUNT NUMBERS ON THE BILLS . A Ms. Kelly Forth answered the phone . She was interested in only getting my phone number to `` escalate '' the problem to Tech Support , even though I asked her AT LEAST 10 TIMES what PageOnce can do AT THIS MOMENT to PROTECT MY ACCOUNT from access should ANOTHER PERSON now have access to MY ACCOUNT . I asked what PageOnce does when there is a possible breach in security , and could she find out who Sharmonique is and whether there was an email sent to HER meant for ME , or can she or someone else freeze my account from third-party access or SOMETHING TO PROTECT ME NOW ! ! ! ! She kept repeating the same canned response repeatedly that it 's `` a Sunday '' and all she could do is write up a report and escalate it and someone would get back to me IN 48 HOURS and to give her my phone number for tech support . So , because `` it 's a Sunday ... , '' PageOnce has NO ABILITY ( at least during MY phone call ! ) to check into a possible security breach and would only `` get back to me in 48 hrs ) ... . They actually want up to 48 hours to do something about this ! Ms. Kelly Forth kept insisting that my `` account was `` safe '' because `` BillPay and PageOnce are two different accounts . '' HUH ? I DO N'T HAVE A BILLPAY ACCOUNT OR SEPARATE PROGRAM ! THE BILLPAY IS INTERTWINED INTO WHAT WAS MY PLAIN OL ' PAGEONCE APP WITH NO WAY TO SEPARATE THEM ! ! ! I insisted over and over again that how could that be when I now have BILL PAY INCORPORATED INTO MY PAGEONCE ACCOUNT/APP AND HAVE NO WAY OF REMOVING IT EVEN THOUGH I ASKED FOR THAT TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY , AND WAS DECLINED ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT MY ACCOUNT N-O-W ! ! I even asked Ms. Kelly Forth whether it was advisable for me to DELETE THE ACCOUNT in order to protect it , and would it be possible if she can surely tell me that Sharmonique does not at this point ALSO have access to my account ! And she would not say ANYTHING except `` the only thing we can do is report it and take your phone number for someone to call you back in 48 hours ... '' over and over and over , with NO SOLUTION OTHER THAN THAT LAME ONE . I ca n't even decide whether deleting it myself is proper because now if someone else has my account information , then I HAVE NO WAY TO GET BACK IN TO MY OWN ACCOUNT TO PROTECT IT OR CHANGE PASSWORDS OR ANYTHING , ESPECIALLY TO SEE THE ACTIVITY ON THE ACCOUNT , and possibly a THIRD PARTY DOES ! ! SO NOW I AM STUCK NOT KNOWING AS OF THIS MINUTE WHAT I SHOULD DO , WHY I GOT THE EMAIL FROM SOMEONE ELSES BILLPAY ACCOUNT ACTIVATION , AND WHO GOT MINE ! ! OR WHY THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO SOMEONE ON THEIR END `` INSTALL '' THE BETA BILLPAY INTO MY PAGEONCE ACCOUNT WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME OR ANYTHING ! AND I NEVER EVEN CLICKED ON ONE LOUSY LINK IN `` SHARMONIQUE 'S EMAIL '' which WAS the email to confirm that I WANTED THIS ! SO HOW DID THE BILLPAY GET IN THERE WITHOUT MY PERMISSION OR INSTALLATION ? ? I CLICKED ON NOTHING ANYWHERE TO PERMIT THIS ! OH ! One other thing I noticed ... . when I was in MY PAGEONCE APP , to get OUT of it , I clicked the backup button on my android ( as you would normally do to back out of something ... . AND THERE WAS A WHOLE SCREEN WITH A NEW LOOK TO IT THAT SAID `` PAGEONCE BILLPAY BETA '' on it with TWO HUGE CLICKABLE BUTTONS UNDER THE `` LOGO '' ... . ONE WAS TO ACCEPT AND THE OTHER WAS TO DECLINE ! BUT it DISAPPEARED IN 2 SECONDS AND went RIGHT BACK TO THE PAGE YOU NORMALLY GET WHEN YOU SIGN IN . I tried it AGAIN ... . WENT IN ... . BACKED OUT ... and the screen flashed VERY QUICKLY and DISAPPEARED AGAIN ! ! ! Now explain to me ... WHY WOULD THE APP HAVE A DECLINE/ACCEPT feature on a `` new main screen '' if you have to SIGN UP FOR THE BETA PROGRAM OTHERWISE only AFTER you have already installed the normal PageOnce without BillPay ? ? ? ? What kind of a trick is THIS ? And when would THAT screen have come into play ? Why did n't I GET THAT SCREEN WHEN I FIRST SIGNED IN ? Because it BYPASSED IT ON PURPOSE when I first signed in , that 's why ! I only saw it when I BACKED OUT of PageOnce and guess I `` tricked '' it into showing me what SHOULD have been or was SUPPOSED to be the new `` first screen '' of the app IF IT HAS BILLPAY BETA INSIDE IT ! WHAT KIND OF TRICKERY IS THIS ? IS THIS THE KIND OF COMPANY THEY EXPECT US TO TRUST ALL OF OUR PERSONAL DATA WITH ON A DAILY BASIS ... WHEN THEY RESORT TO TRICKERY AND DECEPTION JUST TO GET YOU TO BE ONE OF THE MANY GUINEA PIGS THEY NEED FOR THE BETA PROGRAM ? MY QUESTION TO YOU PEOPLE WHO HAVE DOWNLOADED OR ARE THINKING ABOUT DOWNLOADING THIS PROGRAM IS : DOES THIS SOUND LIKE `` BANK-LEVEL SECURITY '' TO YOU ? ? ? ? ? If this were MY bank , I 'D FIRE IT ! ! I AM THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED AT THE LACK OF THE ABILITY OF PAGEONCE TO REACT TO A POSSIBLE SECURITY BREACH BECAUSE `` it 's a SUNDAY . '' PERHAPS INSTEAD OF HAVING MS. KELLY FORTH WORK ON A SUNDAY just to take phone calls from what she says is Los Altos , IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR PAGEONCE TO PAY A TECH SUPPORT PERSON TO BE ON CALL JUST IN CASE SOMETHING GOES TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE BILLPAY BETA PROGRAM AND GOES HAYWIRE SENDING OUT INFORMATION ON THEIR CUSTOMERS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS and WORRIES THEM SICK TO DEATH ! ? ! ?

He traps the deer in a net , and call me ignorant , but I 've never heard of a hunter trapping a deer in that manner . That is over the top cruel and unrealistic . How is this even a pleasant story for a child to read ? I had no desire to read any of the other so-called stories after that . It reeked of someone pushing an agenda on fertile young minds , painting an American tradition such as hunting in such an exaggerated violent tone . Also , all of the illustrations are wierd and poorly done , and all of the characters have snide , sneering expressions on their faces , even Cinderella ! i 'm sure there are better story programs out there with a more talented illustrator I can download ."}, "3551": {"id": "3550", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I really wanted to get this for my granddaughter and was hoping I could put it on her Kindle .

Large files are usable , but barely . The file system is a complete annoyance . There is no option I can find that controls where files are stored ; without asking , it simply copies everything to its own folder , which is confusing , a huge waste of space , and a hindrance to syncing files back to a computer .

The controls are a mess : most things are done by tapping , but it is erratic and poorly implemented . Unintentional page-turning is a constant frustration . The soft-buttons meanwhile are illogically and inconsistently arranged , and tiny ; the new feature resizing them for tablets does not even work more than 40 % of the time . Adding new features is the only `` improvement '' that the developers seem interested in making . If you 're into aesthetics , the design is also ugly , and the menu text is incomprehensible jibberish.In fairness , updates are relatively frequent , but have so far done nothing to fix basic interface problems , or make the program more stable overall . Quite the opposite , really : does anyone really need to watch video embedded in PDF files on a phone or tablet ? I certainly would n't , unless I wanted to watch it in jittery slow-motion .

IT NEEDS AN EXIT BUTTON . I find it HIGHLY ANNOYING and somewhat suspicious when an app doesnt provide that simple feature . Understand , I now find I wont even use the app because I WILL NOT be forced to take the time for all the extra steps it takes to go to my phones Settings , then to Apps / Manage Apps , scrolllllllll allllll the way down to find THIS app in the list , click on it , and then scroll to the Force Close button , click that , and exit out of that and then out of my Settings and close the folder I house them in . Really ... should I have to go through THAT every time I want to access , lets say , my grocery list just to add one stinkin bunch of bananas ? ? All apps should have EXIT BUTTONS . Why ? ? If all apps felt they were the exception to this courtesy , theyd all `` not be running/open , '' but theyd all collectively be using the internal memory of which they have no business using if I want to CLOSE THE APP BECAUSE I AM THROUGH WITH IT UNTIL THE NEXT TIME I WANT TO USE IT . I emailed the developer about this , first mentioning that there is no Exit button , and asked why I needed to Force Close it through Settings . His prompt reply was to educate me on the android platform , making no mention of the Exit Button part of my email ( so I assume theyre not working on adding one anytime soon ) , and basically blamed it on android by telling me `` thats how android works '' so that you can go back to an app using the Recent Apps menu button . He made NO mention that should I choose to go back to the app even after using an exit button , it would still be listed there and just reopen in one second.IMO , a standalone , non-syncing app such as a simple list maker NEEDS AN EXIT BUTTON . Let ME decide whether I want to `` back out of it '' and keep that small amount of memory going or CLOSE IT COMPLETELY AND FULLY . I shouldnt have to rely on a third-party app to control such nonsense from apps whose developers wont provide you with the common courtesy of a simple , lousy EXIT BUTTON.NOW ... ..A word about permissions here . YES , the developer COULD have had the phone permission thing there because he wanted his app to pause while a phone call came through , but in the app world , that `` one permission '' he needed is just not available to developers ( yet ? ) . It only comes as a `` bundle pack . '' Even when there 's no apparent need for the Phone State and Identity permission on an app , many apps request it when you install it . What that ALLOWS is for advertisers like Google to spy on you . Phone State and Identity is n't `` one permission '' it 's a whole BUNCH of permissions bundled together . It allows the app to see if you 're on a phone call , read your phone number , your phone 's IMEI number , the IMSI number of your sim card , and the device ID assiged to your phone ( unique only to YOU ) . Let 's review ... .If you 're on a phone call ? Ok , we can live with that so that your phone can like tell the media player to pause the music until you hang up from the call . Yeah , that 's AN INNOCENT PERMISSION . The media player should keep quiet while I 'm on the phone ... but it does n't need to know my PHONE NUMBER ! IMEI , the IMSI , and the unique ID seems innocent , but they 're not . That unique ID is the brass ring to all spammers and advertisers . These numbers can track you , and they 're not like `` cookies '' on the web brower that you just opt out of . You can delete a cookie , but that device ID is permanently tied to your phone . The IMSI identifies your sim card and you ca n't change that , and changing the IMEI is just plain illegal in lots of countries . Now you throw those ingredients together with the permission to GO ONLINE ( and that 's ONLY going to come from `` FULL INTERNET PERMISSION . `` , and that 's a disaster recipe and the potential for abuse is just LIMITLESS . The phone permission thing is not SPLIT . That phone `` state '' permission should n't be in a bundle pack with permission to read your PHONE IDENTITY . And that phone identity permission should be tuned , too , like permission to read your phone NUMBER should be separate from the other permissions . Unfortunately , there 's just no way to split it yet . They should allow granting phone state permission but deny access to phone IDENTITY ... . or even better , feed BOGUS identity information to the nosy apps.NOW , OTHER permissions a phone has in conjunction with this one may be a `` sinister bundle '' with the intent to be nosy and grab your info for subsidiary purposes , but I 'm not the developer and ca n't comment on what the developer 's intentions are because of the android phone permissions bundle dilemma ."}, "3686": {"id": "3685", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I just discovered , after years of having and using this app that it automatically sends your usage data to flurry analytics !

Or those yellow pointy headed ( small ) birds against structures of reenforced wood interlaced with cement ! The underpowered projectile birds simply either remove small chips or bounce . The sweet spots are few and very difficult to hit , and the damage is minimal ! And when you do get a good weapon ( projectile ) , there 's mostly just one followed by three or four worthless ones . In one play , if you want to hit a snowball at the top of a mountain holding back some boulders , you have to hit it directly on to drop the boulders . Extremely close is n't good enough.Finally there are what I call & quot ; immortal widgets & quot ; -- green little piggies that no matter what happens manage to end up under a pile of concrete and steel , well fortified against attack .
