The HO areas do get a bit hidden behind the list of items to collect , but expanding the size overcomes that small problem .

Math Bingo by 22Learn is a great app for children from Preschool to 4th Grade . It teaches the child everything he needs to know about basic Math , such as Multiplication , Addition , Subtraction , Division , etc . The app is very interactive and the interface is perfect for kids with adorable depictions in the form of animals and games . The app 's games are the best part ! They 're Halloween-themed and my niece 's favorite would be 'Catch A Ghost ! ' . You can choose the difficulty level to match your child 's learning speed . I find the curriculum to be perfectly selected for each grade . This app is very entertaining and at the same time , extremely educational !

My son is a Kindle Fire fanatic , so he will definitely want to play with this for hours just because it 's on my Kindle . I expect he will be way ahead of his class after he 's played with this for a while . This is another fantastic app from 22L ."}, "4180": {"id": "4179", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Just in time for Halloween , Halloween Math Adventure is a great app for helping children learn basic math facts and operations . From the time children enter school to the time they leave , basic math facts are a necessity . Not knowing these facts can cause problems later on as more complex math relies on knowledge of these basic facts . Facts are also crucial for mental math . As a tutor , many of my students experience some difficulty related to not knowing the basic math facts , and we spend a lot of time drilling and practicing them.I 'm happy I found this app because my students love it , and I love the fun Halloween theme . I will continue to use it after Halloween , too- the theme , characters , and games are really great ! What I love most about this app is that it works for pretty much everybody . Younger kids can practice addition and subtraction while older users can work on multiplication and division facts . This makes the app a perfect fit for me , as I work with children of various ages . This , along with 3 difficulty levels , makes it very adaptive to individual players and sure to be useful for a long while ( an amazing value , considering this one cheap app can be used to drill math facts through multiple years and grade levels ) .Users can input their name and choose an avatar- which I love ! Kids love personalization , and the avatars are really cute . The user simply selects what type of facts they want presented ( numbers , addition , subtraction , multiplication , or division ) and the difficulty ( easy-hard ) . The user can then choose which game they want to play . The hardest difficulty involves double digit problems , so I would even argue that this app can be used to teach children a little older than 4th grade as well.In Bingo , a fact is presented and the user must pick the correct answer from a grid of numbered pumpkins . Correct answers are marked and the game ends when a 'bingo ' is achieved . Memory Match has you match math problems and their answers . The game ends once all matches are made and all cards are flipped . I especially like this game because it allows the player to build confidence by completing the problems they know first . It also helps them see which problems were more difficult and identify what to work on in the future.Pumpkin Hunter displays a problem and set of possible solutions . In this game , players have limited lives and time to complete each problem . This is great as most kids enjoy playing against a clock and testing their skills . In Catch a Ghost , players are shown a problem and tap the ghost that has the right answer . This game is similar to Pumpkin Hunter because it is timed and lives are limited . The games are all fun and kids really enjoy the Halloween characters , themes , and sound effects.Overall , this app is a winner ! It includes all types of math facts at multiple difficulties which makes it a great value . Other app developers make each set of problems into individual apps and charge you each time . With 22Learn 's app , you get everything in one convenient package . High scores are tracked and players can enjoy beating their high scores or those of their peers . Settings make it easy to control sound , music , and difficulties . Professional voice acting and colorful illustrations complete this perfect math-fun package ! It was a huge hit with my students , and I 'm sure it 'll be a huge hit for your math learners as well ."}, "4181": {"id": "4180", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "My preschooler loves this game because of how interactive it is .

This has to be the WORST I 've encountered and I 'm shocked because everyone raves about it . I think this must simply be because people have not found the many highly superior ( many Candy themed ) match 3 games out there that are TRULY FREE or very inexpensive to play . This game not only looks pretty shabby ( for a beautiful spectacular looking Candy match 3 game check out the free Candy Deluxe Pro available free here on Amazon ) but it is also so limiting in what it allows you to do that it literally becomes unplayable . Do n't want to wait for two and a half hours when you run out of your very limited 5 lives ? PAY US MONEY or log onto Facebook and spam your friends . Once you reach level 35 the game is truly desperate to get your money so it will not allow you to move to the next level until you pay the ransom or play 3 `` quests '' which are merely levels you have already played . Okay , I can do that . Play and beat the first `` quest '' level and guess what ? You may not play again for 24 hours to do the second quest ! When you beat that one you wait ANOTHER 24 hours to play the final one . This is the only game I have ever played that prohibits you from playing the game . It is n't really much of a game either as it is deliberately and obviously rigged in much the same ways as a carny hucksters game . You will NOT beat a level until the game decides that you will ( generally when you are using your final life - a cynical ploy to get you to pay for more lives ) . Level design is also so difficult that in advanced levels you will almost certainly have to pay for ( outrageously expensive ) `` boosters '' to move on.I really do n't get it . The only explanation for the popularity/social phenomenon nature of this game is that people have not played the MANY better ones . For awesome Candy themed match 3 games try : CANDY DELUXE PRO , CANDY SWIPED , CANDY OF KING , MO CANDY ( that one is 99cents ) , CANDY POP . For great match 3 's in general try JEWEL STAR , JEWEL LEGENDS , DRAGON GEM , HEROES of KALEVALA , SEASONS MATCH ... so many great ones . The ones that require you to pay ( cheap too ) give you the ENTIRE game , not just pay to progress a little further and then pay again . The fawning reviews here mystify me , particularly the ones that seem so happy the game is `` finally '' available on Amazon . The reason the game took so long to come out is so the game will get a huge new influx of players to make it seem like interest in the game is not diminishing ( which it does do fairly quickly , at least for my friends who have tried it and quit playing it when in became annoying ) . CANDY CRUSH is a truly disappointing and I think , rather despicable mess ."}, "4270": {"id": "4269", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Slow load , when it does finally the graphics flicker and the app locks .

However to play these levels you would probably have to invest a bit for the extra energy , especially since it costs double the usual energy to play them . That would take a big chunk out of your playing time.Originally you get four energy to play , acid level costs you two each game so it 's not worth it unless you invest in the shop for more base energy . Energy refills every 15 minutes and levels only take a minute or less . If your like me , it 's a fun game but not worth waiting for more energy to play . That includes if you spent the.99 for more energy , which only increases your base to 8 . Totally NOT worth it .
