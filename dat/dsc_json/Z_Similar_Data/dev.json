Lots of dropouts and blips in the music occur if I bring up the EQ and tinker with the settings , or try to use the EQ , a music app and do something else in the foreground . The phone 's not quite up to snuff to integrate the EQ seamlessly , which is not surprising since it ca n't play music on its own stock player without dropouts for the most basic of things , like checking mail or swiping through home screens.Second is a much newer and more powerful device , my Acer Iconia A700 10 & # 34 ; tablet . The EQ works better here , but despite its quad-core processor it still glitches and stutters with Music Volume EQ loaded in the background while other things are going on . If the tablet is left alone with just EQ + a music player , it seems to do fine . I have not tried to use it while playing HD video yet.Last but certainly not least is my personal everyday phone , an HTC Droid DNA . EQ works beautifully here , with no lag , hiccups , blips or dropouts when using any music or video player . I 've run the EQ with active Bluetooth , Google Music cloud player and Waze all running together with no issues & # 8212 ; a great thing for commuting ! I actually use it in conjunction with the phone 's built gimmicky Beats Audio enhancement to make it actually sound good instead of compromised.For me , the only thing that detracts a star are the hard to use and mostly useless & # 34 ; knobs & # 34 ; for bass and virtualizer . Oh and the lack of bands in the EQ . A good EQ to me should have at least 10 bands , ideally more . If you really want to impress me , make it like the one built into the Rockbox software that can be overlaid on old mp3 players & # 8212 ; multi-band EQ with totally customizable center points and Q settings .

Most hidden objects fit in with the medieval setting , but there are a few anachronistic objects such as hand grenades and pizza . As your game improves , you can move up to the tougher modes .

It has the least functionality of the four , but also the lowest regular price , at a buck.While the other calculators had hosts of scientific and business functions , this one adds mostly trig functions . What I find clunky is that the trig functions are hidden under an ADV ( advanced ) button so that the numbers and trig functions do n't appear at the same time , causing you to have to toggle back and forth.There are two nice features of the calculator that salvaged four stars from me ( otherwise I was about to give three ) :1. you can enter your entire calculation in one string and then hit equal2 . it has parentheses so that you can correctly mix addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division ( and other included formula functions ) into your calculation in your needed priority.You get an exponent function in with the trig , but not a simple square function , so for example to do 8 squared you must enter 8 on the number screen , then tap ADV , then tap ^ , then when it returns to the number pad tap 2 , then `` = '' . Again , kind of clumsy compared to most calculators which would give you both a square function and an exponent function . The same process is needed for roots.The buttons are HUGE on a tablet device . So while I 'm sure this is more convenient on a smart phone , on any tablet there is just a lot of wasted space that could have been used more efficiently to keep you from having to swap screens for anything but simple math.My four stars might be too high but I 'm going to leave it at that , since the app is inexpensive , does do the job , and does n't have a long list of intrusive permissions.I used this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and had no problems with it.While I think the focus on trig functions is a bit unusual , I 'd recommend this app if those functions , plus basic math , happen to fit your needs ."}, "27148": {"id": "27147", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Works great does the job easy to operate and easy to read the numbers.if you are looking for a easy to operate and read this is it"}, "27149": {"id": "27148", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This one has the distinction of being much simpler and easier to use than some of the others .

The puzzles are similar to the ones on the other two games , with the added element of mickey standing in the background waiting for his water.Now , for the warning side of things . There are two things you should be aware of as a parent . This game does use a little more crude humor than the other two . The whole premise of the game is that Mickey is trying to make lemonade to sell to hungry customers , and much of the humor reminds me of older Mickey cartoons . These are not horrible , just things like a lemon `` peeing '' into the water.The second thing is that you only get the Mickey maps , the full Goofy ones are not included ( and must be purchased separately ) . This can mean some complaining ensues at that point - and requests for the additional maps ( only the first couple are included as a teaser ) . I will give my opinion of the Goofy maps since it does n't appear that you can actual search for them separately.The Goofy maps cost $ 1.99 and are significantly cruder than the Mickey ones . In Ship Wrecked , Goofy is trying to change the random things he finds on the island into food . If you fail to get the food converting material to him , he does things like eat his hand . So this is not for young children.The second set of Goofy maps Goofy is trying to paint a picture . Similar types of things happen while he is trying to paint , though mostly around his frustration if he does n't get his magic paint . The pictures he does make if you get the `` paint '' to him are kinda cool older Disney drawings ."}, "27165": {"id": "27164", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It 's a fun game , all the `` where 's my '' games are very fun ! : - ) my kids and I love it . highly recommend it ."}, "27166": {"id": "27165", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "My four year old daughter is in complete and utter love with all things Mickey , so this game was a no-brainer to purchase .

With a surprising depth of strategic planning , and a wide variety of aliens to collect ( 24 in all , randomly awarded ) , there is a huge replay value . Best of all , there are no time constraints , so you are free to contemplate and make careful choices.The game controls are smooth and fluid , with no problems on my Kindle Fire HD7 . I had an issue which was my fault , not the game 's , where pieces were n't sliding correctly ( taking only part of what I had selected ) , and ultimately the game crashed . After the second time I realized I had too many other things running and not enough resources to support the game . With that in mind , I have n't encountered any further issues.The game mechanics are simple : match any 3 objects ( not only linear matches , also 2+1 , it took me a while to figure that out ) which will evolve into the next higher forms of themselves . There are plant forms which ultimately evolve to become & quot ; magic , & quot ; and alien forms which will become a & quot ; supreme & quot ; alien , giving permanent rewards.Each game begins with 100 energy crystals . Each move , or use of power-ups , costs one crystal , while matching plant forms and crystals replenish the energy . Prior to the game you have the option to purchase 50 additional energy for 4000 gold ( as well as other boosts at various prices ) , and following the game you have the option to purchase 50 additional energy for 5000 gold and continue.Gold is earned through gameplay , and there is also a blitz mode ( 60 seconds of slightly altered play ) which , I was pleased to find , rewards gold that counts in the hive mode , giving a quick means of earning additional gold when necessary.There are three permanent upgrades , which can be purchased for $ 1.99 each : double starting energy , +50 % gold earnings/purchase , and an upgrade to a game feature . Any of these purchases will also remove in-game ads . The ads are generally unobtrusive , and I 've seen no questionable content that would be kid-inappropriate , however , there have been occasional between-game video ads which I found jarring and annoying.I ended up purchasing the additional energy . I 'd pay $ 1.99 for a good game , which this surely is , so why not support the devs . Besides , it got rid of the ads , and doubled my play time , so I 'm happy all around.My supreme alien strategy : magic plants are the key , collect plenty before wasting other resources trying to do the impossible . I purchased both the pre- and post-game energy , as well as a wormhole boost for another 3000 gold ( not sure that 's a must , but it did n't hurt ) .Magic plants act as a wildcard , and will evolve ( match ) any two adjacent pieces . I used these to match pre-cocoon aliens , cocoons , and small aliens , so , with 7 magic plants I evolved a supreme alien with moves to spare . One could use more plants to evolve even the earlier versions if playing with original energy values , without the $ $ purchase -- after playing a while you 'll get a feel for how many plants you might need.Enjoy ! : O )"}, "27211": {"id": "27210", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Sorry , I have n't tried this yet , but when I do , I will let you know how it works for me ."}, "27212": {"id": "27211", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "definitely something to keep you busy when you are bored . the ads are a bit annoying but forgivable .

I asked myself how other , more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly . `` Application Folder Pro '' , my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management . Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that 's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface , the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort . In my case ( XOOM , Honeycomb ) they do n't . I was n't able to justify allowing a `` vendor 's '' app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it , just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it .

There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate ' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives ' , this does appear to be a well-thought , well-designed overlay but it 's a radical departure from Android 's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was : if they believe that Android 's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out , why not produce their own mobile OS ?

An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone , whether a call is active , the number that call is conncted to and the like . * Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage . Allows an application to write to the SD card . * Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator . * Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks . * view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi . ( network comm . ) Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a `` car version '' of the Block Me game , especially the Market 's PAID version . The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions , so in the paid version , you 're paying for `` more game '' and not `` less/no ads . '' The developer clearly does n't care about giving you more `` game '' for the money , because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon . He knows asking for your phone 's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call , and who called you , are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining . So he takes it out ... . but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful `` leaderboard action '' and `` rate this app '' and `` notify me of bugs '' stuff , as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they do n't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app , what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD , what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to ( even WITHOUT the phone serial number request ) , why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one ( for now ) , and what he 'll likely do to update YOUR app once he 's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back , just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here , for instance the `` paid '' version of Bubble Popper . The permission for the phone is IN there , even in that PAID version.P.S . Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why , especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia .

You can read other reviews for the specs . The various items , options , features , and functions are wonderful . It 's very clear a ton of thought , research , and understanding went into this product 's design . The rocking seat , changing table , and bassinet quickly become obsolete , but that 's just picking nits since they are relatively fine products.Two vastly underrepresented features are the storage & portability . I could n't be happier with how easy it is to pack up this playpen and go . The entire play area folds in on itself into a small rectangular shape . All rods and nets fit perfectly within the same frame . The bassinet pad folds perfectly into a rectangular shape that encompasses the entire playpen . The entire thing slides perfectly into the carrying bag . Make no mistake ; this is not one of those designs where `` perfect fit '' is synonymous with `` requires the same strength necessary to pull a stubborn mule through a doorway . '' It 's snug , but easy to insert because there is a zipper that fits to perfect.So , how do you carry this entire thing ? Well lookie there , what does the outside of the bassinet pad have ? A sturdy , fabric handle ? How does that help ... Oh.no.they.di'int . Oh , yes , they did . The carrying bag has a perfect hold for the handle to pop through just to the end of where the zipper finishes . Then the entire thing fits in a snug rectangle that can be stowed away into the dark recesses of a closet or under a bed . Design perfection.I 'd be remiss if I did n't mention the safety and ingenious SafeLatch Technology , something of which I 'm reminded every time I put the playpen up or take it down . The SafeLatch requires the proper sequence for it to work , and the locking system is rigid enough to withstand significant pressure . To undo it 's as simple as pushing a sturdy button . Even if some sort of Hercules toddler were able to push the button hard enough ( unlikely ) , the playpen folds in on itself from the bottom . It 's like standing on a book and trying to read page 50 . Not gon na happen.Virtually zero complaints here .

Its really cute , sturdy and durable . The little cuddle cove is awesome and the changing table is plenty big and has a nice area on the side for diapers and accessories . The instructions to set it up were completely backwards and complicated though . It told you how to put the pack n play together , and then it told you how to put the cuddle cove , changer , music etc . together , but you had to take things apart in order to do the second part ... they should have switched that around so you didnt have to take things apart that it told you to put together . We put it together in our living room and when I went to put it in the baby 's room , it wouldnt fit through the door ! That was definately frustrating that they would make it just a smidge too wide to fit through a doorway , so again I had to somewhat disassemble it to get it through the doorway . Overall it is a great pack n play , and high quality . Satisfied customer.I have had this pack n play for 8 months now . The changing station is useless . I could never use it-they should have used stroner material so that it would n't bend to one side when you put your baby on it , and no my baby was not big at all..6lbs . So its not a good quality changing table at all . I did use the music maker and the night light it had on it . She slept at our bedside for 5-6 months and I never had to change the batteries . When I had to assemble and dissasemble the pack n play I would put the center down first and then try to assemble the sides last ... do not do that ! It is impossible and very frustrating . My hausband finally figured it out to assemble the sides first and then the center last , and it is a breeze to put together ! When you disassemble pull center out first then take down sides . I dont know why I ever though to do it the other way . I am very happy with this pack n play still ! I must warn though that if you are looking for a light-weight pack n play this one is not for you . It is also quite bulky too , when you `` pack '' up the pack n play the mat does not fit in the bag which i think is a pretty dumb design , but that does n't bug me too much anymore considering i lost the bloody bag .

Just read the instructions and practice with it.- The changing pad locks right in and is solid . Mine never leaned like some of the reviews say .

You can also connect to an MP3 player for lullabies or white noise .

Even for those moms-to-be , like myself , who do n't agree with or foresee themselves ever using a play pen , it really is a necessity in my opinion .

She seemed uncomfortable , and she tended to roll to one side . Also , we were worried that she might choke if she spit up in her sleep while laying flat on her back in that bassinet . So , we opted to set up the Pack N Play in our room instead , and to use the `` napper '' attachment as a bed . If I had known how very useful this thing was going to be , I probably would have stopped my wife from converting our guest room and office into a baby room that does n't even really get used . From now on , my advice to new parents will be that a Pack N Play is the only baby furniture you need for the first few months of the baby 's life , so do n't worry about a crib , dresser , changing table , or bassinet . All of those are included in the Pack N Play.There are a few minor imperfections in this thing , and that is the reason I give it four stars instead of five . I will highlight the good and bad below.GOOD : '' Napper '' attachment - This has actually served as a bed for our newborn baby . It is very soft and she sleeps well in it . We also like that it keeps her at a slightly inclined position so that she breathes better and wo n't choke if she should spit up in her sleep.Electronics - The music has served as a lullaby not only for the baby , but also for me and my wife . We put the music on every night , even if the baby is already asleep . Also , the vibrating base has really helped when the baby has gas . There is a built-in timer , so it will save the battery life too . I just did the first battery change after six weeks of daily use.Shelves - We actually have n't used them yet because we have n't taken it on a trip yet , but that is going to be very convenient when we take it on a trip.Changing table - It is nice to have an attached changing table with nice steep sides . My wife 's mother came and stayed with us to help out for the first couple weeks of the baby 's life , and we had to put her up in the nursery on an air mattress , so we did n't have access to the changing table in the nursery for those late-night diaper changes . This was a suitable alternative , and was much better than just using a changing pad on the bed or floor . The steep sides keep the baby securely enclosed , so if you need to step away for a second to grab a diaper or something you do n't have to worry about the baby rolling off . There is one problem with it that I will mention later.BAD : Assembly : OK , so the basic bottom unit assembles fairly easily . You just pop it into place and put the pad in . If you ignore the unnecessary step that calls for turning it on it 's side and digging out the velcro loops to attach , you can have that basic assembly finished in a minute or two very easily . The difficulty comes when putting on the other accessories . The directions call for putting the release buttons face down on the napper , but if you do that it is incredibly difficult to take the napper back out again . My advice would be to install the napper with the release buttons face-up . They are very stiff buttons and there is no way that an infant could release them , so there is not a safety concern , but you need to see them to really release them properly so if you follow the directions and put them face-down there is a sanity concern . If you disregard the velcro straps and install the napper with the buttons face-up , assembly is not so bad . It took me about an hour to assemble the first time , but much of that was the napper and velcro . Can you imagine getting off a long flight or car trip and spending another hour to put together a pack n play before finally relaxing ? Forget it.Portability - Again , this is not a problem with the basic bottom unit . The outside rails fold up and the four-piece pad wraps around them to make a nice portable unit that you can pack up and throw in the car . However , there is no storage for the poles , the shelf unit , the napper , or the changing table , so you must carry all of those items separately . We have not been on a trip yet , but I imagine I will have to carry a separate duffle bag to hold the parts that do n't pack up with this unit.Changing table - As I mentioned earlier , this is a great feature to have , and we do get use out of it when there is a guest staying in the nursery and we ca n't get to the regular changing table . The only problem with it is that it does n't sit flat . I have tried adjusting it , but no matter what I do it tends to lean towards the outer rail . Maybe this is meant to compensate for the baby 's weight and will correct itself when my daughter weighs more . Right now , it causes her to roll when I am changing her unless I prop her in the corner . When you have a kid like my daughter , who prefers to take a second pee as soon as her diaper is loose , any rolling around translates to a big mess , and that was a lesson I had to learn the hard way on this changing station . I am still glad it is there , I just wish it was more flat.Toy bar - I guess it was nice that they included the toy bar with the velcro flowers , but my daughter does n't seem to pay much attention to it and it does n't attach very securely to the napper . It would have been better if the put loops on there so you could attach some of the other universal toys , and it would have been better if it secured to the napper more firmly because this one pops off all the time.Overall , I am very pleased with the Pack N Play , and I would suggest that every parent invest in one . I will come back and update my review if I notice anything else worth mentioning ."}, "27544": {"id": "27543", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "We use this EVERY DAY .

I ca n't comment on how the baby likes it yet but I will review the product based on quality , durability , features , usage portability and setup . First I took out all the pieces of the box and every thing was there . Had no problems with missing pieces . The package arived on day three instead of day two but it was a holiday so understandable . The instruction manual is kind of a joke . The instructions were vauge and the pictures at times were not helpfull . In fact , some of the pictures used , you could not even tell what was the pictures were of and in some cases made the setup harder than it needed to be . It took me about 45 minutes to an hour to set up , being my first pack and play and all and it has a lot of extra features , I feel that was too long . Unfolding it and using it as a play pen it very easy and portability for that use would be outstanding , however , thats were it ends . If you need to use the bassinet feature , sleeper or changing table , it becomes a hassle . the changing table is n't to difficult to attach or de attach but the sleeper on the other hand , once its installed forget about portable . fork lifting a port a potty from one spot to the next is easier than this . the bassinet is n't too difficult setting up , especially after you done it once , but taking it apart is somewhat difficult because the support rods are two poles that connect with one another and almost refuse to come apart . you will spend at least 5-10 minutes fighting that to take apart . The storage underneath is a nice feature and will make it easy to store lightweight items such as diapers , towels , wipes , maybe a few changes of onsies and etc ... keeping us from funning back and forth from the nursery . the & # 34 ; play bar & # 34 ; that has the toy stars on it is just light velcrow squares that are on the star and a small strap and connects using the velcro . I can see that baby would probably disconnect it easily and alot . the play bar is not solid and fairly flimsy . The unit itself looks very nice and and every thing , once installed does seem pretty solid and safe for baby . If you plan on having a & # 34 ; portable pack and play & # 34 ; this is probably not your number one choise but for the cost and amount of features , it is very nice . It also includes a vibrating thing and music soothing thing and the unit itself seems to be of top notch quality and design .

Our daughter sleeps like a bug in a rug in it , and the changing area/table seems to be pretty well made/designed too.The only things that I was n't sure on the little light , music thing . The light is not really functional when the Pack 'n Play is fully configured like in the picture ( you 'd have to see it ... ) but the light shines either above or below where you want it to be .

I 'm sure it has to do with the fact that I am due in 42 days and my tummy got in the way at the very beginning , when simply trying to snap the sides into place . Then , this is also the first pack n play I 've ever seen , let alone set up , and there are many parts . Due to my excitement , I also set up the pack n play without reading the entire book first , I 'm went from page to page and set up as I was reading the guidebook ... . Wrong to do if you want to set up each part up to the napper and change table . This led to me having to take apart things I already put in place , like the mattress ... Sigh . Maybe if I would have been patient , lol.However , I love the look and feel of this now that it 's all in place . I have already decided that I will not be traveling with this while little one can use the napper and changer and storage space still . It is too much of a hassle to take the napper in and out daily , if going from one place to the next . I ended up getting a stand alone napper for traveling with her instead . It seems to be more easily portable once the tiny infant stage is passed and the play pen is being used and that 's it.So ... If you do n't need to be super-portable and will use this around your home , this is just fine . Keep in mind that the napper and change table must be used with the pack n play ...

I am 37 weeks pregnant and just put this together . Assembly is very difficult , and I say this having put together , sometimes with and sometimes without my husband , 2 large pieces of ikea furniture a rocker/glider , and a storage unit . By far this was the most difficult thing to assemble . I followed the suggestion from the top comment on putting together the napper , and that was quite helpful when it came time to disassemble.Speaking of disassembling , I had to in order to get it from the living room , where I first put it together , to the bedroom , where i plan to sleep the baby . We live in a small east coast apartment and I was really looking forward to saving space and money by being able to roll this from the bedroom to the living room depending on where I was . It is too wide for our bedroom door frame . Probably most people will not have this problem , but you might note the dimensions and measure your door width just in case . It 's a real disappointment to me that I ca n't move this from room to room and will have to find another container/holder for baby for the living room.All that said , it seems nice . I 'll update once baby is here , but the product itself seems to be good quality . The storage shelves made me choose this model over other Graco Pack N Plays , and it really is a good deal of room . The toy bar does not attach very sturdily though . Still , I 'm happy with it.Update 10/13/13 : The baby is here and she is 10 weeks old today . We have used this pack and play everyday . It is where we change her diapers and she has been sleeping in the newborn napper almost every night . She is under 11 lbs , but already starting to get a little long for it . She 'll probably size out of it by 12-14 weeks , and that 's okay . As I said above , I ca n't move it from room to room , but so far that has n't been so bad . I put her down in a bouncy chair in the living room .

I love their snap wraps ! I could use flatfolds and prefolds with a Thirsties duo wrap exclusively , but I was looking for something with more convenience so my husband would be more apt to jump on board with cloth diapering ... you know , so he does n't have to touch the wet and dirty parts . ; ) I had a couple of BumGenius 4.0 's because I heard high reviews ( I love them , by the way ) and was going to get more , but these duo diaper snaps were on sale for $ 15 so I got one to try out.The gussets will always be my favorite feature , but there were a couple things about the duo diaper that I just did n't find that appealing.First off , the micro-fleece seems flimsy and of cheaper quality ( compared to bumgenius ) and I find myself wondering just how long they 'll last . ( Now , worst case scenario , if the micro-fleece falls apart like it feels it 's going to , I can just cut it out and use it as a duo wrap , so no huge loss . ) Second ( and last ) complaint might be a little petty but I 'll share it anyway . The way the pocket openings are put together seem sloppy , both front and back . They 're loose and you need to stuff the inner end back into the diaper before letting your little one run around . Nice idea to be able to stuff them two different ways , especially if the Little One 's in the midst of a diaper change , it 's nice to be able to empty and re-stuff from the front , plus the instructions state that because of the design , you do n't have to manually remove the insert before washing ... it supposedly comes out in the wash automatically , but I 've not tested this myself.I 'll definitely continue to go after the duo wraps , but I can do without the duo diapers . If we decide that we want more pockets , it 'll be the BumGenius brand.Update : After several weeks of use , I 've changed my opinion of these . The fabric liner is not cheap or flimsy , like I had originally believed , and the openings are n't as sloppy as first observed . The convenience of front or back-stuffing far outweighs any before-thought inconveniences .

The soaker agitates out on its own ... .really are easy to stuff ... .have really strong snaps ... .have a stay dry fabric that touches baby 's bottom , making for a very comfortable all night diaper ... .colors that are very true to the pictures on this site . And I do love the colors and prints.These diapers are absolutely awesome . I bought them ahead of time long before my son was born . He was 7 lbs 3 oz when he was born . The Thirsties Duo Diaper had a very comfortable fit , but was still slightly loose around the thighs , this caused them to leak just a little bit.By the time he was 3 weeks old , he weighed 10 lbs 2 oz . That is when I started him in these for real . They fit so well around his legs . They are not that bulky , they are extremely absorbent , and best of all they DO NOT leak ! Thirsties Duo Diapers , like the Thirsties Duo Wraps have gussets that keep even the biggest newborn explosions inside the diaper where it belongs . The diapers also do not get wet on the outside like some diapers do , even tho the pul side of the diaper is very soft and squishy.He is now 6 weeks old and slightly over 11 lbs . The diaper still fits , but is on the very last setting with both snaps on the diaper . This is the only Con this diaper has . The snaps are beside each other . This really limits the sizing in my opinion . I can see these as fitting for a little bit yet if my baby would lengthen and not get any fatter . But the problem is , my baby will get fat . All my babies are fat . They are fat , roly poly little snugglers . So I need a diaper that has a broad range of fit.If you have babies who are long and not so roly poly then this wold be ( in my opinion ) the perfect diaper for you . They are soft , cozy and very comfortable for baby . But for me , I will sadly have to trade these diapers for an option with a longer and better fit for a fat baby .

The duo diaper has the wonderful double gusset which means there is absolutely no leakage . The insert is easy to get in and out so you do n't have to stick your hand in poo to remove it . I also love that the insert has two layers - hemp and fleece - that snap together.Thirsties Stay-Dry Duo Insert , White , Size One ( 6-18 lbs ) You can use either or both inserts depending on the level of absorbancy required . The snaps and materials are highly durable -- they still look great after daily washing for months . They fit my 6 mo old perfectly ! And not too bulky , either . Highly recommended.For an ultraslim silhouette , I prefer the Thirsties AIOs . Sadly they do not have the double gusset that I love . They are very easy on/off . There is a tunnel under the second layer of fleece , into which you could slide an additional insert . I have never tried it because I use these diapers specifically for their lack of bulk . They are great for daytime or for potty training ( because baby will be able to remove them herself by potty training age , esp if using velcro closures ) . The only downside to these is that they take a while to dry if you hang them on the line . I line dry all of my diaper covers and AIOs because I find that they get roughed up in the dryer . On a side note , I do n't buy velcro diapers anymore because I found that the velcro falls apart with repeated washing . Snaps are much better.At first I felt that it was more expensive to buy the Thirsties , because you have to get them in 2 sizes . It did n't take long to realize that `` onesize '' diapers are actually far too big for young infants and too small for toddlers of potty training age . After I brought my 6lb baby home from the hospital I discovered that NONE of the diapers we 'd bought came CLOSE to fitting her . I had to buy an emergency stash of Thirsties XS size diapers and covers . Great for petite babies and preemies ! She was able to wear the Thirsties size 1 at 8 lbs and the other brands ' one size diapers at around 14 lbs . If you have a large baby , perhaps the one size would work for you , but my small baby was n't able to use them until about 5 months old .

My son totally loves this , he loves the way it swings and the different sounds . We have been using this swing for a couple months now and love it ! I would like to dispel some `` Cons '' by another reviewer . I will put their review in `` quotations '' and I will put mine after each statement in ***stars*** . `` Despite what another reviewer said , this swing does not go back and forth like traditional swing . Yes , you can adjust the way the baby faces ( up to four directions ) , but that does not change the fact that the swing moves in a side to side motion . Considering that I bought this swing thinking it could go front to back , this is a major con for us . '' ***Think about it . So it does go back & forth like a traditional swing but the seat is angled a bit different . Actually , this can face more then 4 directions because it totally rotates around in a circle . *** '' The highest speed is still incredibly slow . We 've never used the lower settings because we do n't see the point . I 'd like to have more reasonable speed options . '' ***I do agree with this , the swing is slow but not too slow , my twins still love it . *** '' The mobile bar is a bit pathetic . The two stars are velcroed on . And the bar does n't fully collapse back , making it very difficult to get your child in and out of the swing without bopping his head . The mobile bar is removable , though , so that could be an option each time . '' ***The mobile bar does collapse TOTALLY back , maybe they re-designed it ? Because mine comes off or sits all the way back , which makes it completely out of the way . No bopping heads here . *** '' The footprint is pretty big . Luckily , though , the swing radius is n't much bigger so you can set the swing in one spot and expect for it not to take up much more space . '' *** The swings radius is not any bigger then the base , we live in a 860 square foot house and there are 8 of us combined , this fits nicely in the corner or our living area without hogging up a ton of space.*** '' ... . it does n't sit flat , causing it to flap around a bit against the floor every time it swings . We 've put felt pads underneath the uneven parts to keep it steady and quiet . '' ***I too noticed this when on my hardwood floor that is not completely level . We moved and in the house we moved out of , we had carpet and we never had that problem . Felt pads took care of the problem cheap and easy for use in or new house . *** '' There is no locking feature , so when you put your baby in or go to get your baby out , the chair still has some movement , making it more difficult . I 'm sure most swings are like this but because it rocks side to side , not front to back , it 's more pronounced and frustrating . '' ***I do not notice this with my usage of the swing . ****** Everyone who comes over to visit loves the swing too ! Super easy to assemble ( my 12 year old and her 13 year old friend put it together in less then 20 minutes ! LOVE the battery OR plug in option . The only Cons for me would be that it could use a softer seat ( like some memory foam or the like ) and that the swing had an obnoxious squeak straight out of the box , I called customer service and they had me a replacement motor within days , great service !

The Graco model is a nice swing and the way it supports underneath accommodates taller kids ( the FP one has a swing bar behind the head and my daughter 's head hits it now unfortunately ) . What I do n't like on the Graco swing is how the harness works . It 's much like her Graco high chair in that it has 5 point system - the shoulder straps ( the FP one does n't , it only has the lap harness ) and lap/crotch straps but they are awkward with a sleeping baby to get into place . The crotch strap is even more awkward to use and seems a bit short - the pad falls off constantly . If you have a choice between the Graco and the Fisher Price Cradle swing - get the Fisher Price !

Very versatile.2 . Animals are big enough for baby to pay attention .

So I was n't going to make another mistake for the next one . I spent quite some time looking around , and actually even trying to put myself in my daughter 's place in the crib to see what she sees .

Even though my daughter is older now , we found a way to elevate the mobile so that she ca n't reach it ( by attaching the mobile to the highest side of the crib ) even when she sits or stands up . She loves everything about it : the animals , the variety of music , the soothing light . She falls asleep within SECONDS with the white noise mode on . I have to agree with the reviewers that say that the music is n't exactly soothing , because they are very few of the songs apart from the white noise that would make her go to sleep . But that 's not a bad thing for us , since she is having a blast in her crib and develops her sight and sight tracking skills with it . This mobile has a double use for us : soothing with the white noise option , a toy with other modes . She especially loves the 'World Music ' mode , it is so unique and unexpected as 'baby songs ' , and yet it works ! And last but not least : you can turn it into a music box once baby is older .

I was very skeptical this would meet my needs but it does ! Here 's a list of what I was looking for and how this mobile fits the bill.1 . Must be automatic ! ! - With my first child , I used the one where you have to manually wind the mobile every few mins and it was a pain in the butt ! I saved all my baby stuff so I could reuse it for baby # 2 , but the manual mobile went straight into the trash ! 2 . Must be cute and not too girly looking . - I bought the blue one for my daughter and it 's very cute and not to `` boyish '' for a girl.3 . Must have bright colors - In order for you baby to be intrigued with a mobile/toy when they are a newborn , it must have bright colors.4 . Must be easily removable - The reason why this is a must is because I do n't want my baby to be overstimulated . Overstimulation makes it hard for my daughter to fall asleep because she 's too wired and her brain has a hard time shutting down . When she starts to yawn or look away after 30 to 40 mins of playing , I simply remove the pole out of the music box . It 's very easy to remove or reattach . It 's great that I do n't have to remove the whole unit.5 . Must have multiple options for sound and nightlight combination- This mobile does almost every combination you can think of . You can turn on night light , sound and rotate animals at the same time . You can turn off night light and just have sound and rotating animals . You can have nightlight and rotating animals on with no sound by just lowering the volume until it becomes mute . You can have just sound by removing the pole from the music box.6 . Must stay on for at least 20 mins - I am thrilled this stays on for 40 mins . I have n't seen any other mobile that stays on longer.7 . Must entertain my baby - My daughter is 2 months and it entertains her for at least 30 mins ! There are n't many toys that entertain her at this age but this one does ! There has been many times where she play for 40 mins and then passes out ! 8 . Must be versatile - This is my 2nd and last baby ( I think ) so I hate the thought of buying baby stuff that can only be used for a few months . Since this can be used as a music box for a toddler , I was sold . Not sure if it 's going to really be useful but hey it 's better than nothing ! 9.Must fit on my crib ! - My crib has thicker slats and I have found it hard to attach toys to it . I have no issues with this mobile . Fits like a glove and it 's very secure.There are 2 things I thought I wanted in a mobile but after using this I realized I do n't need it.1 . Since babies like toys that light up , I thought it would be a good idea to have a mobile where the animals light up . I realized during the day that function is useless and at night I want my baby to sleep not play ! 2 . I wanted a remote control but since this mobile stays on for 40 mins , I do n't need it . I thought not having one would be inconvenient but it 's not bad at all.If you 're debating between this one or the popular Fisher Price one like I did , I say go for this one ! It 's cheaper , cuter , plays music longer and it grows with your child ! You wo n't regret it ! P.S . - Only the giraffe on mine makes a clicking sound . I am not docking a star for this because the clicking is not a loud annoying click . It 's a soft click so it does n't bother me or the baby . Maybe if all 3 did it , it would be annoying.Update 10/9/13 - I still love this mobile , but I wish it had a timer for 20 , 30 or 40 mins .

I was really surprised because none of the other reviews that I read mentioned this sound.I 'd suggest 2 improvements to this product : 1 ) Offer a setting where the music can be used without the mobile even when the mobile is attached ( you can use the mobile without the music , and you can use the music without the mobile by detaching the mobile ) , and 2 ) Somehow redesign the product to silence/eliminate the click when the animals spin . If these improvements were made , it 'd be perfect . I 'd also love a remote feature , which our defective Fischer Price mobile had , but that 'd just be icing on the cake ."}, "27629": {"id": "27628", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This thing is a god send !

The straight edged silicone tip is firm enough to efficiently wipe the messes that do get around his mouth . It far surpasses our other baby spoons for scraping.What I do n't like about this spoon ( other than price ) ? - Because the spoon is so narrow , it 's difficult to get much food on it- especially runnier foods like pure fruit purees . By adding some oatmeal or cereal we can thicken it up enough to work ( although we do that anyway to avoid prune or mango induced explosions ! ) . However , this means than for anything but the thickest purees it takes much longer to feed than the standard wide spoons.What I 'm ambivalent about : - The double ended spoon . I do n't feel like its really necessary- especially with one silicone , one metal . I typically use metal end to scoop in cereal/oatmeal , and feed with the silicone end . I wish it were one solid surface for cleaning purposes- you can lift up the silicone edge slightly which means food can squeeze in there too.Our son is almost a year old and has been using these spoons since about 8.5 months .

The perfect size for baby 's little mouth so that you can get the food all the way in because when you ca n't deliver the food towards the back of the mouth , especially when babies are still learning how to swallow , you will end up wasting all the food and your effort as the natural reflex of the baby 's mouth and tongue will just push the food out of the mouth and it gets all over the baby 's face . These are double ended so you can choose which side works best for you . There is a stainless side and a soft silicone side . When you 're new to feeding and afraid to hurt your baby 's delicate gums the soft side really helps you practice feeding your baby without fear . I find that the silicone side also works great as a scraper to get all the food off from around the mouth as well . Like a quality silicone spatula .

My baby is now 8 months old , but she is quite little and was not sitting on her own when we purchased this product . It has finally made bath time fun and safe for me and my child . I had kind of a Goldilocks experience with various bathtubs - tried the collapsable foam bath , but it was too small to use for very long , did n't fit in any of our sinks and eventually the soft foam literally ripped apart . Then we tried the popular Primo - it was too big , awkward , a huge pain to store in our small apartment , and so deep that my infant would just float off to the side of the infant seat . Then we tried a bath seat , which necessitated filling the whole bathtub , and did n't have any features to hold my child in place so I had to keep a hand on her all the time , which hurt my back and usually meant I would just give up and get in the bath with her . Finally we took a chance and invested in this tub , and it is fabulous . Its smallish in circumference which makes my baby feel safe and contained - she can grip the sides if she wants , and and I can fill it very quickly . Its deep enough so the water covers her legs and belly , but base of the tub is rounded and smaller than the upper rim so she never gets fully submerged , even if she scrunches her legs down , rolls , or loses her sitting balance . We still use the reclining position and have never had a problem with the prop collapsing - you just have to make sure the prop is correctly positioned in the slot before you fill it with water and put your baby in the tub , as per the directions . After the bath , it collapses to flat and we hang it from our towel rack . Best of all , it is the first time my baby has truly loved her bath . She used to be nervous and skittish in the water , but in this tub she can sit , recline , splash , and kick , without fear .

I will update this review based on the `` field '' use soon.Little background : I like Graco products overall . I 've been using Metrolite Graco stroller for over 3 years now and still happy with it . No problem what so ever ! I never own another double stroller - only tested few in the store or chat with some friends who have other brand double strollers , and hated all available sit and stand models ... all looked huge ! It took me 15 minutes to put this stroller together out of the box . The hardest part was to insert pins in the wheels . Other than that all directions were clear and easy to follow.First impression - it 's HUGE ! ! ! [ Remember I mentioned I never had double stroller before ? ] The underneath basket looks large enough for diaper back . It 's possible to access it from the side , but I do n't think it will be easy to fully use it from the side only - just to get something from the bag or drop something in the basket.It feels very nice to push it . Very smooth stroller ( at home and at the paved sidewalk outside ) . It has very nice and deep 2 cup holders and another place to store keys or cell phone at parent 's tray . Child 's tray is nice too . It 's a little higher compare to Metrolite stroller level wise , so I think it might be uncomfortable to use for the younger children.What I absolutely love about this stroller is the way it folds ! It 's truly a one hand fold ( keep in mind it lays flat on the ground after you fold it ) . It does n't stand by itself , but I do n't really care about it . It 's heavier compare to Metrolite ( of course and there is nothing wrong with this ) , but when it 's folded , it takes nearly the same space as Metrolite ! Amazing ! I have never though double stroller could be folded to THAT size ! I took a picture comparing this stroller with Metrolite , so I am adding them to Amazon.What I do n't like about this stroller so far is the front seat . I think it 's more for toddlers than for infants . It does n't look comfortable for some reason and as I already mentioned before , the tray is at a relatively high lever . After reading other reviews I was worried about flat position of the front seat - I was under impression it will not be flat enough for a baby to sleep comfortably there when reclined . I was wrong . Even though it 's not completely flat , it 's very similar to the seat Metrolite has . When it 's fully reclined , older child will not be able to seat on back seat.As for the seat for the older child - it has little padding and the belt . There is a nice size step for the child . I love to be able to walk without hitting this step ! Overall I am very impressed with the initial quality and the stroller itself for the money I spend . I will update my review after a real `` test drive '' aka Disney trip with 2 kids : ) UPDATE : After using this stroller for one of our Disney trips I have something else to add to my review ... First , let me tell you I had two 3 year olds with me and they were happy to have a stroller ! It was a little hard to push the stroller with two little ones ( 30 lbs each ) . Also , I had a feeling the stroller always tried to roll to the right , so I kind of had to push it towards left side.The bascket underneath is great - very roomy and easy to access from a side . The only problem is that it can not hold anything more or less heavy . We had 4 bottles of water ( 0.5L ) and the bascket was pretty much to the ground . I also had to watch nothing will fell out from the side.I love that parents tray as well as child 's tray both have deep cup holders.Even though I have nothing to compare this stroller to I still happy with my purchase . Renting double stroller at the Disney for 3 days cost the same as to buy this one from Amazon !"}, "27719": {"id": "27718", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I bought this tandem shortly after my daughter was born when I discovered she would n't be safe sitting next to my son in a side-by-side stroller ( we had a combi and he liked to hit/smoosh her ) . We 've had it for 3 years . I have the version pictured in the product description , with the large plastic pieces on the sides . I like this stroller , but I just replaced it for a double jogger ( for reasons listed below ) . Here 's the good and bad things I 've noticed about this stroller : Cons : -The biggest con for me is that the front seat leans back too far over the back seat . The kid sitting in the back constantly has the front seat jabbing them in the back . This causes fighting and makes neither of my kids ( DS5 and DD3 ) want to sit back there . Also , there 's no way my son could sit in the back if I had the seat reclined for my daughter to nap . Two sleepy kids would be out of luck.-This thing can be a serious load to push and can be hard to turn . That 's pretty standard for a tandem stroller , and from what I 've heard this one is better than others on the market . I 've pushed it loaded with both kids ( about 80lbs ) and all our gear around the zoo all day and been ok , but it might be difficult for others.-The basket underneath is a bit hard to access . The only way to get to it is from the side . You have to have two free hands to do it , otherwise you 'll be crouched down there sweating forever.-The sun shade only covers the front of the stroller . The kid in the back needs sunglasses and extra spf , no way around it . It also moves very easily , allowing my kids to adjust it ( translation : whack each other ) on their own.Now the good : -The parent tray on this stroller rocks . The cupholders are nice and deep . I think I 've only ever spilled one drink while using this stroller . There 's also a spot in between the cupholders for your phone , keys , napkins , a sippy cup..whatever.-While the basket underneath is hard to get to , it holds a lot . I can fit three or four bags under there.-I do n't know what the listed weight limit is , but I 've actually had three kids at a time smash onto this stroller ( at the zoo ) and I was still able to push it ( with considerable effort ) .-The snack tray on the front holds snacks/drinks and the cup holders are deep enough that they do n't fall out.-This stroller folds up and unfolds easily . When folded it is about the size of a single travel system stroller . It fits in the trunk of my VW passat with room to spare.Just a few more notes . There is no cupholder for the backseat of this stroller , so I bought a BRICA deluxe snack pod stroller drink and snack holder and attached it to the back of the stroller on the side . It works awesome.I tried buying a joovy too rear seat and attaching it to this stroller , but it did n't fit . Graco should consider making a similar product.We are preparing for a trip to Disney , and that is what prompted me to purchase a double ( side by side ) jogging stroller ( I got the BabyTrend expedition double ) to replace this one . The sun shade and uncomfortable back seat plus hefty pushing requirement ruled this stroller out.If I had it to do over , instead of buying the combi double stroller and this stroller and now the double jogger , I would have just purchased a city mini GT double . Even though it 's pricey , it would have been cheaper than these three strollers and would have served all of my needs and my kids would still fit in it.I like this stroller , it worked ok for us , but it does n't make me 100 % happy ."}, "27720": {"id": "27719", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Great stroller .

It is considerably heavier ( almost 10 lbs ) than the stroller we were originally looking at , but that is to be expected since it is built to hold two children.My husband is a handy guy and was able to assemble the stroller fairly easily . There were a couple of points where he was a little confused but he was able to figure it out quickly.The stroller is very easy to open and close , once you get the feel for it you can perform this function with one hand . The features are very intuitive it is easy to turn and maneuver . It is , however , quite large even in the folded position . It takes a little work to get it in the almost non-existent trunk of my Mini Cooper.I would caution two things , and they not so much negatives as just something to keep in mind . The product images show the older child standing in the stroller facing the parent , where the manual clearly states that children should be facing forward when standing while holding onto the stroller frame to avoid falling . This position seems like it would be a little awkward , but I guess the child always has the option of sitting if they prefer . Also , the product description says that the stroller `` Accepts all Graco infant car seats '' but the manual states that only a Graco SnugRide , SnugRide 30 , SnugRide 32 , SnugRide 35 or Infant SafeSeat car seat is compatible .

We ended up selling that one and buying this one , which was much more affordable and actually quite sturdy considering how many times we 've already used it . The front seat reclines a bit ( but keep in mind when reclined there is no space for the child in the back to sit - I suppose you ca n't have everything and it is a fair trade off to have a more compact stroller ) . It is very easy to get my younger 14 month old daughter into the seat ( just push a button on the tray on one side and lift and it clicks back in place when baby is strapped in ) . And my son who is 3 years old likes to sit in the back seat and occasionally stand on it when he does n't feel like sitting . This is especially useful since he goes through moods where he wants to sit and sometimes he just does n't want to be strapped in and wants to walk around . The stroller itself is very easy to turn/maneuver . The canopy on the front is not so huge but it does the job , and you can easily move it forwards/backwards to cover your child appropriately . The cup holders are a good size , they hold most standard soft drinks and cups unlike some other strollers that have impossibly small ones that only hold small water bottles . There is also a center console to put your phone in . Opening/closing the stroller is a snap and very easy to fold . Another plus is that it is not impossibly heavy to get in/out of your car . There are brakes on the back wheels that occasionally my son plays with but it 's not a huge problem . Customer service is also great , we had an issue with the opening/closing mechanism of our stroller and they immediately resolved the problem and were very kind on the phone .

Before that we had a single Jeep stroller and before that we owned a single Evenflo stroller . This combines all the best features from all of them and is really a delight to use.Pros : - The seats are weighted to hold 50 pounds each . That 's the largest rated amount I was able to find in a sit and stand type stroller . It should be able to last for quite a while if I needed it to.- It 's easy to get in and out of for both the back and front seat.- Large basket for several jackets , water bottles and other similar items.- It 's one hand collapsible with a latch on the side.- Both seats have belts , though I do n't use it on my 3.5 year old . He 's pretty good about staying put and enjoying the ride.- Lightweight at 29 pounds , compared to a double . Comparatively my son weighs 30 pounds , so it 's the same as lifting him.- When it 's folded up , it 's smaller than the size of the single stroller we had . No problem fitting it into the trunk.- Here 's the best part , it 's incredibly easy to maneuver . With both kids in it and even things in the basket below , it still manages to turn on a dime.Cons : - When the front seat is laid down , my son has to stand as there 's no more room for him to sit.- Sunshade is a little stiff to adjust than my last Graco stroller , but I 'm hoping that it just needs to be broken in a little.- With my son sitting on the back , it 's hard to lean it back and bump it up to go up stairs or over curbs.- I wish the latch was automatic locking , but it 's manual , so when you collapse it down you have to be sure to attach the latch before picking it up.Overall , this is still the best stroller I 've ever owned !

A friend had given me a Baby Trend Double Stroller but my 3 yr old who 's tall for her age looked cramped in it , my then 6 mo looked like she was slouching out of her seat most of the time , and it maneuvered horribly . Plus , trying to load the monster stroller into the trunk of my 4 door sedan resulted in horrible language spewing out of my mouth every single time . The Sit N Stand was my answer ! The Good : -Infant car seat can be clicked into place in the front seat . I already have a Graco infant car seat so it was very convenient . No waking up sleeping baby ! -5 point harness . The shoulder harness is looped through the side harness then clicked into place in the center . Now , this is my opinion , but why I like this particular 5 point harness is that with one click , all the parts of the harness falls away and you can just grab your baby instead of first getting their arm out of the each harness THEN pulling them out.-It also maneuvers amazingly , considering it 's a stroller and a half . I can even get away using one hand to move it.-Good size storage area . Like others have mentioned , its hard to get to from the back , but you can easily pull the mesh fabric down from the side to get things in and out of the storage bin-Folds down pretty easily . Fits the trunk of my Acura TL with no problem.The Sort of Bad : -crappy canopy . Come on , Graco . Why would you make half a canopy ? Seriously , either give us a decent size canopy or just do n't provide one at all . Also the canopy does n't adjust all the way forward . I have to do some serious creative maneuvering to keep the sunlight out of my baby 's face.-The lock mechanism for when stroller is folded down . After I fold down the stroller , I have to push down on the stroller to get it slim enough so I can click the plastic piece into place to lock it ( so it does n't open on you while you 're trying to get it into the trunk ) . When I want to open the stroller , i have to do the same . Folding/unfolding the stroller is easy . locking/unlocking it is not . its annoying I just dont bother sometimes.If you have a baby and a toddler , but do n't want a bulky double stroller , this is a great alternative .

When you 're changing the bags on the champ , it can be messy , depending on how long you waited to change the bag , but with the Decor , you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it 's full to the brim -- so much easier .

Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work ! And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2 . The smell . It 's probably not as bad with an infant , but let me tell you , opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience ! Yikes , what a smell after just a couple days . We used the odor prevention garbage bags , but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid . Since nothing seals off the individual diapers , it 's just a sea of messy diapers in there . Yuck.On the plus side , it 's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags , not the expensive ones the Genie requires . And it 's certainly easy to use . But I 'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year , we 'll be going back to the Diaper Genie . It 's not perfect , but it 's much cleaner and there 's less odor involved ( the reason to get one of these products in the first place ) .

It 's worth noting that I thought I could simply rip it off along the hinge by tearing the thinner material there . I could n't ... The plastic is very tough so no worries about the plastic flaps coming off on their own because of use . Removal required a sharp utility knife ( or similar ) . I left the cover over the headphone jack because I use it less frequently .

The instructions were inadequate at depicting all the necessary steps in applying the screen protector to one 's phone display , and the pull-tabs to remove the film from the front and back of the protective panel pulled away from the film ( instead of taking the film with them ) and thus required me to struggle at getting said films off the protector.Overall , this is a great case .

On this new model they are perfect , not hard like on the S3 but not to soft either . I was really pleased about that but the one thing that does have me a little worried is that on the S3 the outer hard plastic goes around the pushers just leaving the corners exposed with the rubber and on the S4 the hard plastic ends underneath the volume and power pushers , leaving more of an area with just the rubber . To me atleast , it just seems like the S3 has better protection with the outer hard plastic going all the way up . I 'm not sure if it was made this way so they can make the pushers softer or for better grip but in any case that is what I noticed and thought I should mention it . Besides that , the rest of the case is wonderful . It 's not to bulky and has a good feel to it . I would trust this case over most others .

This was NOT a result of getting bumped around in shipping - it was the way the manufacturer had stuffed it into the box .

Anyway , It worked just fine in the otterbox case.SPIGEN glass screen protectors : I purchased the .23 mm version of the glass . After applying it the Otterbox case was significantly harder to snap together . I stopped trying to force it for fear of damaging something . I think the .15 mm version of the glass might work with this otterbox case but I ca n't say for sure.Other thoughts on quality : I have had Otterbox Defender cases in the past . With the S4 case I feel as though they used a cheaper material to make the rubber shell that goes around the plastic one . It still protects and this is just a personal observation/opinion.The reason I docked one star is because of the plastic film that is built in to protect the screen . On any of the otterbox cases I have owned this screen is n't that great as I feel it gives the screen of my phone a filmy look ( I hope this makes sense . ) I have heard others just remove it and substitute there own but I have never personally done this and I do have to admit that you can get used too it . I still dock the star though because in this case where the phone has an HD screen I feel it matters.Bottom line : I do like this case but sadly am returning it since I applied that glass screen protector .

The back , sides and corners of the phone are well cushioned and the included screen protector covers the touch screen without affecting its performance . There are protective flaps over the charging port and headphone jack , which close securely when they are not in use . The on/off and volume buttons are completely covered by protruding buttons which operate without any problems by pressing on them . There are openings for the Home button ( it is the only button not covered ) , earpiece , light and proximity sensors , both cameras , flash , speaker and microphones.The holster holds the phone very firmly , so firmly that it is difficult to release the phone from the holster with only one hand . This is not an issue for me , however , because I do not use the holster on my belt . I have used the holster on the sun visor of my car and it keeps the phone close while driving . The kickstand on the holster performs its function well and holds the phone at a comfortable viewing angle when the phone is on a table and I am seated.When the phone is laying on a flat surface its back , the rubberized material of the case keeps the phone firmly in place . However , the phone slides easily when placed face ( screen ) down on a flat surface . I therefore usually lay the phone on its back when putting it down on a flat surface and rely on the screen protector to prevent any potential damage to the screen.Installing my phone in this case was challenging . Although the process was fairly intuitive , I had difficulty removing the screen protector from its holder . The directions included in the box , which consisted only of a simple diagram , were useless and the on-line directions on Otter 's website were not any more helpful . Unfortunately , by the time I finally got the phone installed in the case , there was a permanent scratch on the membrane of the screen protector , but this does not interfere with viewing the screen . I eventually found an instruction video by a user on removing the membrane on YouTube , but only after I had installed the phone in the case.This case substantially increases the size of the Galaxy S4 . I usually keep my phone in my side pants pocket and inserting and removing the phone from this pocket is somewhat difficult with this case on the phone - considerably more difficult than with other cases I have tried . On the other hand , this case offers excellent protection for the phone .

If you like it on your belt or waist band the holster with click can be put on the front or back of the case ... that is , screen covered or showing as it 's clipped onto your person.Yes , the buttons on the edge of the phone are a bit harder to press through the protective surround , but nothing horrible and serves as a reminder that your S4 is protected well . Charge port and headphone port have flexible parts of the case to seal them , but attached on one side so ca n't be removed and lost.Do n't expect the `` vibrate '' function to be as pronounced and useful as it was before as the S4 is that much more insulated from your person to feel the vibrations as before ... This Defender is not waterproof rated even if it seems that way.Otterbox has a new case that is waterproof if that is what you need . It 's the new `` Pursuit Series '' Clear part that goes over your screen is very clear and touch screen feels just the same as without to me.it is attached to a snap on frame that is part of the case and NOT a press on static type film.Although , with the new Gorrilla Glass 3 Samsung is using on the new S4 I never had a worry about screen scratches even with nothing over the glass . More protection is welcome as long as it works as well as the Otterbox design.One BIG thing I like about this case that I did n't expect was that the sides stick up far enough above the screen that I do n't press screen icons close to the edges by accident just from holding the phone . Hooray ! I 'm sure I wo n't be the only person that will find this as an unadvertised feature ... If you ca n't find the `` Kickstand '' feature , just open the clip as far as it will go and press the latch on the case , it will catch on that part and hold it open so you can set the Defender at an angle on table etc.I do like this case so far and hope that it saves the insurance deductable if I ever drop it ... at that point I would raise my review to 5 stars `` I love It '' rating.Now for long term field testing ...

I had a thin silicone case before I got the OtterBox and I was always worried about dropping it because it was very slippery , but the Defender has the rubber part on the outside which provides for an excellent grip . I never worry about dropping my phone anymore because it 's easier to hold , but if I do drop it ( or my daughter ) I know it will be protected.It is very hard to get the case off if you need to clean it . I like to clean my phone about once a week because with these cases dirt and dust tend to get trapped under the built in screen protector .

Plus it make the phone feel good and non-slippery in hand as you use it.The clear screen protector was okay , but I did eventually remove it and the double sided tape that held it into place came off quite well with little to no residue . I put on a Steinheil Spigen SGP Ultra Crystal screen protector instead . There are many advantages to having a screen protector of the highest quality and physically attached to the screen , but the biggest one is that should the screen crack , it will still be usable . My wife dropped her phone and was able to use it just fine for months with a very cracked screen . It is now our daily alarm clock.I had to shave and round off and the prongs at the bottom around the USB port so that it would fit into my modified SmartDock , which also has 3 parts removed so that I do not have to take off the case for either my S4 or my wife 's Note II . Well , I have to take the rubber part off of this case , but that is no real issue . It was also required for the MHL 2.0 's rather large MicroUSB plug to fit without removing the case.I am generally afraid to handle my phone without this protector on and with it on , I feel I can use my phone all I want without fear.The belt clip fits well and does not seem like it would break or slide off as easily as past ones have for me . Update : It has slid off a couple of times these past few months , however the phone is none the worse and I have a tracker enabled should I discover it missing.One negative is that I can never feel it vibrate ( keep reading for an update on this point ) Another is that the clip is uncomfortable when I do not have a shirt tucked in.Another negative is that , while the clip allows you to stand it up in landscape mode , it is at too sharp an angle ( about 85 degrees I 'd say ... I think 60 to 75 degrees may be better ) After getting this Case , I purchased the Samsung EP-CI950IBUSTA Wireless Charging Cover and found that this case does not work well with the thickness of the new back cover . I finally got it to snap together by removing the inner lining of the plastic case for the back of the phone.The unexpected bonus of the tight fit is that I can now fell the S4 vibration alarm when using the Otterbox case .

I will update it this part a later on when I make a new update.So far , I gave it 5 stars as that is what it deserves.Update 3/27/2014So , I dropped a star because the pink rubber part of the cover is peeling away by the camera area . It is still being used , just it is not lasting as long as I would have hoped for the price I did pay .

I loved it . So , after I sent back the cheapo case , from i-Blason , I decided to spend the extra money and get the Otterbox Defender.I ordered my defender case from Ebay , since I was able to get it there for $ 29.99 shipped , and at the time , Amazon was $ 38.50 , but as I write this , Amazon is now at $ 31 , which I would have paid the extra $ 2 to buy it from Amazon ( faster shipping with Prime , and great customer service ) .I have used the case now for a few days , and really like it . The case fits the phone perfectly , and was easy to install . The phone , once in the case , slides into the holster both face up , and face down.The reason I am taking away half a star is because the power button is extremely difficult to activate .

Good job , Otterbox ! : ) Price update June 14 : Saw it drop to 31 and change , then back up.Update 6/11/13 : Just an FYI folks , this is currently at 34.82 and free shipping ! This is a no brainer , and a steal . None of the stores around me are giving any kind of discount ... .if they have it.I still love this case , but I did want to let you know that if you rely on the vibration to notify you , you might miss some calls . This does soften the vibration quite a bit . If you are holding it , it 's not a problem , but sometimes , when it is on my belt with a shirt tucked in , and I am walking , I do not feel the vibration . There is no problem if I am still . I also think that this is in part due to the phone . The vibrate strength , even on full , is not as strong as my old phone , so the extra cushion from the case just softens it up even more ... .but you know what , this weekend I have seen three people with this phone and Belkin cases and they all had cracked glass ! After getting a Belkin case for my S4 , it took me only an hour to go out and buy theOtterbox 77-27434 Defender Series and Holster Case for Samsung Galaxy S 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black . The difference is night and day and while this is more than twice the price of the Belkin it is totally worth it ! Plus , you do n't need to spend money on a screen protector , so it really is n't that much more.The Defender is really a three piece , full coverage , case . It provides full coverage for your S4 , corners , back , front , screen and it has flip covers for the charger connection , etc. , and those flips flip up easily , even without fingernails . The case itself provides excellent grip all around without being intrusive . It is a little difficult pressing the buttons on the face , but my fingers are a little big . One of my FAVORITE things is the screen protector ... .NO bubbles ! Yup , you heard me right , no bubbles . That 's because you do n't actually have to `` apply '' the protector to the screen . This is awesome . If you look at every screen protector I have reviewed for my iPhones and iPads , they all had bubbles ... .I have come to hate bubbles , and thought I would have to learn to live with them . I am here to tell you , I am now bubble free ( and so is my wife ) ! ! ! When pressing the side buttons you do have to press a little hard , but for the protection you get , it 's fine . Also , the openings for the camera are angled so that the thick case does not appear in the pictures . The case itself is micro-textured to provide good grip without feeling rough.There is NO interference at all with using the IR when reading and scrolling down by nodding my head or turning a page with a wave of my hand . Sharing pictures and video work equally as well with no perceptible interference . The only real issue is that I did notice a slight difference in wi-fi reception in our house with the case on . It is slightly weaker , but nothing big , and after one day I do n't even think about it . The entire screen isvisible and nothing is blocked.The only thing that I would knock half a star for is the clip is uncomfortable and digs into my skin when it 's on my belt , and is especially bad when my shirt is not tucked in . They could have made this better , and I wonder ifI will come and downgrade this to 4 stars later because of this . For now , I will say 4.5 stars with an easy round-up to 5.Instructions when installing your phone : CAREFULLY remove the rubber gasket , using your fingernails . There are little spaces along the sides . You need to use these to seperate it or you risk breaking it . Once that is done , the rest is easy . Try not to touch the inner portion of the screen as it comes perfectly clean ( at least it did on both of ours ) . Putting everything together after this pointis easy and takes less than 30 seconds . Gently click everything together and you are ready to go.We both love this case and I highly recommend it ."}, "28172": {"id": "28171", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "What else can be said about otterbox other than if u value ya phone dnt hesitate to buy one protection is top shelf"}, "28173": {"id": "28172", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I dropped my new phone on cement parking lot with this case . no issues no scratches the phone is in perfect condition it also has the protective covering over the screen built in the case . rotating clip Very ice love for sure ."}, "28174": {"id": "28173", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The case is great , it does bulk your phone up quite a bit , but it adds a lot more protection to the device .

My hands are very small and I can holdit with little issue ."}, "28176": {"id": "28175", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "****I 'm not sure this surprisingly complicated device has ever been explained adequately in the 2,397 reviews that have preceded mine , so I 'll take a shot at it.When disassembled as far as you 're supposed to go it consists of four pieces . You need to disassemble it in order to insert your phone , then reassemble it.1 . HolsterStart by removing the piece with the spring-loaded clip , called the holster , by pressing on the big tab on one side.The holster is designed to carry the case proper . You can insert the phone into the holster so the screen faces out for ready use or in for better protection of the screen . For example , you might want the screen facing in if the mine shaft you 're at the bottom of is about to cave in and there would be lots of coal dust floating around . On the other hand , if you 're expecting a call from Barack Obama in the next few minutes , as I always am , you 'd want the screen facing out so you could just flip the phone a little towards your face and know whether it 's he . Or is that He ? You attach the holster to your belt or your waistband or your tool belt or your love handles using the clip , which then does n't want to let go , which is good for your phone 's health but which also means sometimes it wo n't let go when you want it to , which problem you can sometimes solve by pushing down a little as you open the clip.Unlike the other three pieces , the holster is optional . For example , if you 're about to engage in a bout of sumo wrestling you might want to ditch the holster altogether and just tuck the phone in its case into your mawashi.The holster adds considerable bulk and a tiny bit of weight ( 58 grams ) , but there are three benefits to the holster even if you never clip it to your suspenders or your right eyebrow region when you 're drunk to see whether you can simulate Google Glass . ( Answer : No . ) -- Kickstand . The holster also acts as a kickstand so you can set your phone on a table in landscape orientation and watch a movie or something . To deploy the kickstand , rotate the clip so the top of it , the part nearer the & # 34 ; r & # 34 ; of & # 34 ; Otter , & # 34 ; not the & # 34 ; O , & # 34 ; is resting just above the big tab you used in the step above . You may rotate the clip 180 degrees and your SG4 's display will re-orient itself , but the whole device then teeters a little bit after you set it down and is not really designed to be used this way. -- Grabbing point . The holster 's clip when aligned in the non-kickstand orientation also makes it especially easy to hold the phone . In your left hand you place your thumb along the left edge of the phone in the usual manner but you can wrap the pads of your other fingers around the far ( right ) side of the clip instead of having to reach all the way around the back to the much thinner right side of the phone , which also risks that you will click a live spot on the screen. -- Shock-resistance . Although I 'm no engineer , my guess is that the holster adds protection against damage to your phone if it 's dropped onto a hard enough surface from high enough up.2 . Rubber shellOnce you 've removed the holster you need to remove the rubber-like shell that will surround the back of your phone and wrap around the edges to barely encroach on the phone 's screen . This is a precisely engineed piece of neoprene or whatever it is that because of its elasticity provides most of the resistance against impact damage.To remove it , start by opening the two very sturdy port covers -- one at the top and one at the bottom -- so they do n't impede your progress or tear in case you get too rough . Then choose a corner and pry away at it till you see how the rubber shell is attached . If you 've chosen the upper left corner , use the pad of your left thumb to push the very outside corner away from you , towards the back of the case . Eventually you will see how the rubber shell can be pushed away a little bit from the hard plastic clamshell it encases . Once you 've broken a corner loose you can open up more and more of the rubber shell along the top . Then you can push the rubber shell away from the top right corner , and then the next corner along , and pretty soon it 's loose.Although the manufacturer does n't says so anywhere , this precisely engineered shell is gluten-free and contains no trans-fats.3 and 4 . Two clamshell piecesThe two mating , hard plastic pieces of the clamshell are what most interiorally enclose your phone . The front and the back pieces are connected by tabs on the back that fit into slots on the front . There is one at the top , there are two equally spaced on each side , and there are two at the bottom , for a total of seven.To disassemble the clamshell , press on the back piece where a tab is so it no longer lives in its slot on the front piece . You 're going to gradually separate the pieces , and you have to start with any tab or pair of adjacent tabs that works . Just keep pressing on one tab or another and trying to separate the pieces till they come loose at that point . Once you 've separated that tab and its slot , use your fingers to make sure that little gap does n't close and move along to the next tab , then push it in and separate it from its slot . This is kind of fiddly , but you can do it . After a few of these separations of the tabs and their slots , pretty soon the two clamshell pieces will come apart . ****Whew.Now , here 's how to re-assemble the whole thing with your phone inside , which is why you spent so much money for this product . Lay your phone carefully into the back piece ( mine is labelled & # 34 ; MADE IN MEXICO & # 34 ; for those who care , although I do n't know why you would ) of the clamshell and then press the top piece of the clamshell onto it , making sure to engage all seven tabs you just so laboriously disengaged . Unlike some of the steps of disassembly and the next step , this part of assembly is easy.Re-attach the rubber shell . Shove a corner of the encased phone into a corner of the rubber shell , then start fitting and smoothing with your fingers in one direction and the other . Eventually you 'll get the clamshell entirely inside the rubber shell . Check every millimeter of all four edges around the screen to make sure there are no gaps . If there are , just push the rubber against the plastic till it behaves . If it does n't , I recommend beating severely on the plastic with a 5-pound sledge hammer till . . . fff Wait , no I don & # 8217 ; t. Re-write this.You 're done . You 've disassembled the OtterBox Defender Series Case and Holster for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black , you 've inserted your phone , and you 've reassembled the whole thing . Attach the case to the holster if you want and you 're ready to go . ****If you bought this product without having read this very review on Amazon , would you be able to perform these necessary steps based solely on the instructions included with the product ?

Do n't read this , buy the case and then write a crappy review that says , & # 34 ; love the case but it makes my phone too BIG ! & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; love the protection but my smartphone no longer fits into my skinny jeans ... & # 34 ; you get the point . This case is about PROTECTION .

Why would you not invest a few bucks into PROTECTING your investment ? It takes one simple drop to chip the sides or paint not to mention that the front case could crack . Yes , there are plans now that allow you to replace your phone , but why go through the hassle of starting new again.3 ) Yes , the plastic screen protection that comes with it is not that great , but if you have owned an Otterbox before you know the deal . Peel that one off , invest in a real screen protection film or better yet , get a Tempered Glass Protection screen.4 ) And as everyone who has owned an Otterbox before knows , the hard clip case is either useless and you never really carry it or you are someone who carries their phone on your hip all the time . I myself , do not.5 ) The rubber grip is just enough to be able to shove the phone in your back pocket without too much trouble and yet it has enough grip that it does n't jump out of your hand while using it one handed.All in all , an excellent case .

I used to have an HTC Evo , and this case is FAR better in quality .

The purple part is rubber and the teal is part of the plastic shell . The side buttons are a little hard to press , but in the grand scheme of things that should be a good thing because it 's more proof that my little phone is safely snuggled inside.Best of all : Otterbox backs these with a 1-year guarantee ... so if you break it , lose parts or whatever , they will replace it for free ! Just google their 800 # . I did this for my old otterbox and they sent me a new one right away.Definitely worth the money . You wont have to re-purchase more phone protectors after this one .

Well made and about 15 bucks cheaper than buying it locally from my provider.This is an awesome protector for any phone , and the plastic screen saver does n't seem to hamper the works of the original touch screen at all . Cleaning is easy , just wipe it without worry about messing up the screen of the phone . The belt clip takes some getting used to , but after about two days use , I have figured out the best way to wear it with my daily activities , ( the clip swivels so you can rotate it 360 degrees.At first , it was aggravating with the very tight fit of the case and holster , because the first time I tried to change the battery , it actually took some negotiation and patience to get everything back off . Yes , it 's that much of an exact fit . But , as the saying goes , `` practice makes better '' so have I become with changing batteries and thus , it 's not that much of a hassle anymore.I do n't like the fact that the only way you can clip it to a belt if via a `` pin '' contraption , instead of both , the clip and a `` loop '' , gives this a thumbs down . I prefer a `` Loop '' while at work and also out in public as it makes it really difficult to accidently become unattached with the phone or to have it `` lifted '' from you by a thief.The main reason I am so adamant about a `` loop '' over a clip is that it is easier than most will admit to dislodge a clip from your belt and you will not even know it until it 's too late and you have totally lost your phone . Once , while getting out of my vehicle to pump some gas , I accidently dislodged my phone from my belt and my phone fell to the pavement while I was pumping gas ... After returning from paying for it , I just happened to look down and low and behold , there laid my phone right under the door of my vehicle .

Such a great convenience if you need it to keep there sometimes , say for GPS use . Deal breaker for me.- Phone does not seem to slip - great benefit of using a case.- Very easy to open or clean.Cons -- Not sure about durability of the case especially the 2 halves . Some times they come apart e.g . once those came apart while taking my phone out from my pocket . I feel those should be more secured . But having other pros , I think you can live with it . I hope those will not come out if phone fells down.- I wish case should be more transparent showing beautiful phone.- I am not confident if rubber on outer side ( especially on controls ) will stay intact or wear out . Hope it stays.Summary : It is a great choice assuming that 2 halves will not get loosen more and rubber on outside will not worn out . I am happy with this purchase but It has been only 2 months since I got this case . Despite all the cons mentioned above , I would recommend this for Galaxy S4.Why I did not get other Otterbox Cases : - I think Defender is too bulky & Commuter is very slippery .

Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value , I find it very awkward to use as a phone . It does n't have a normal keyboard , so you must flip the screen up to press the keys , then flip the screen back down to listen and talk . When you get into a voicemail situation , you have to keep flipping the screen up to `` press 1 for English '' , etc . Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $ 20 per month if you want to browse the Internet , use Instant Messaging , or even Download Fun . Otherwise , all you get is phone calls and text messaging ( which is also extra ) . Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $ 5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage . The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter `` A '' has fallen out . It occasionally just freezes for no reason . The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone , so you ca n't take it out to let the phone reset itself . No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip , for example.Internet browsing is cool , but so slow you think it stopped working . I think some of the fault is just the slow connection , but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it 's trying to display.Oh , yeah . Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $ 9.95 to set up your album on its web site , then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction . You ca n't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper , it is n't really ready for prime time ."}, "28402": {"id": "28401", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing , web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go . You can also download limited content . You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook , but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program . Compared to the original Sidekick , SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer . I also think it 's uglier , esp . the new thumb keyboard , but the keyboard is still very useable . Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks , requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service , though , is the poor quality of T-Mobile 's GPRS coverage . T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM ( voice ) coverage in the U.S . When it comes to GPRS ( data ) , it 's even worse , and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt . And when that happens , SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns . This makes a very frustrating user experience , esp . when you need Internet access the most ( e.g. , when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store ) . Unfortunately , T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed , so if you get the SK , be prepared for slow speed and lost connections . Once the novelty factor wears off , the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course , currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II . If you are an absolutely Internet junkie , you 'll probably find T-Mobile 's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK 's true wireless Internet access appealing ."}, "28403": {"id": "28402", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I regret buying this phone , it 's really big , and verizon service is n't that great with this phone .

At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working ( a , s , d , f , and g , etc ) . I was told to call Palm in India , which I did , and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up , because I have really loved Palm . This is my fourth Palm device , though it will likely be my last . I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation . My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices ( my cell phone , my Palm T3 and my laptop ) . And then , that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course , when I took the phone to Sprint , they said it was Palm 's responsibility to repair . When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes , as they always do . Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink , that they said they would give me - this one time - a `` free return and repair , '' meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days . They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $ 25 to get a refurbished replacement , complete with a 90-day warranty ( which I now know means nothing ) . These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just do n't work , and that I needed something immediately . I do n't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people , or how I can be made to feel like they 're doing me a favor by standing behind their product . I am the customer ! Does n't that mean anything anymore ? I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad ( though Amazon 's remains very , very good ) . When a person spends $ 400 on a phone , or any device , it should work longer than a few weeks . But when it does stop working , the company that sold it should stand behind their product , instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility . Subsequent to this occurrence , other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s , as well.There are other issues with this phone . Out of the box , the power/sync cord did not work . I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced . ( I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle , which works fine . ) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume . Every so often , the phone just resets itself - ca n't figure this one out at all . Also , when someone calls in on Call-Waiting , you can not disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call ; in other words , when you accept the Call-Waiting call , it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously , even when the first party hangs up . This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also , there are limited , non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone . And do n't get this phone for its camera : cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise , all the Palm applications work as they should , and as they have for the past number of years . Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all , I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device . My company will stop using Palm , and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint ( when contracts start to expire ) .My apologies for the rant , but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers . Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore ?

If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset , I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception . Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio . When using the headset with my phone , while the phone was in my front pocket , the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable .

But in the dark , this thing is a strobe light . At night , with my headset left on some countertop downstairs , and while I was upstairs , I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling . That 's part A . Part B , the flash results in a very slight audible clicking , not unlike when a camera flash goes off . Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence , be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you 're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good .

There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk , counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it . For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time . My time is worth more than th $ 10 I get ripped off for . But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers . AMAZON 's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth . Well AMAZON , you can start here : Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders , Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $ 30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit . So it has nothing to do with the price paid . Just dishonest online sellers ."}, "28437": {"id": "28436", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them .

As previously speculated , I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit . I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that , more often than not , my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call . My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden . Maybe I did n't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and could n't find one . Maybe mine was defective , I 'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth . In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73 % off but still $ 40 ( orig $ 150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold ) and it comes with its own chargeable case . Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges ! Other colors are a bit more . Check that one out if you wear glasses .

Sent myself a voice-mail while rolling the windows up and down on the freeway without an appreciable loss of sound quality ! Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from `` all windows up '' and `` driver/passenger window down. '' HOWEVER ... . I wear glasses and have a rounder face . It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on . The bulky part does n't sit well on my glasses ' frame . The mouthpiece is not adjustable . I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face . Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same . The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving . The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit . I turn it on before I place it on my ear . Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame . I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update . If it does n't work well for me I 'm sure one of my kids will like it . ( I ended up returning it .

Secondly , the instructions to set the numeric values ( meters vs feet , etc . ) are n't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch , you have to download the full set of instructions to figure that out , then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations , that even with 20/20 vision , I had to use an illuminated magnifying glass to see , then set the values . Thirdly , the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight . It is only good for pitch black darkness ... much too dim , but is probably the same as their military version , which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot ! Fourth , ( probably for the same reason ) the alarm is not loud enough , especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing . As others have stated , it should not be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep . Fifth , the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable ... too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass ( which , as it turns out , I do carry while trekking ) .

I suppose when outsourcing to whichever third world nation is the low bidder , little things such as quality control and accuracy in sizing can be overlooked in the interest of saving a buck ( or Peso ) .Lesson learned : From now on I will try on jeans and personally inspect them before I buy . So much for buying jeans on Amazon , especially from a third party seller such as Sportsman 's Guide . And , so much for Wrangler in general ."}, "28885": {"id": "28884", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "These are very nice hoop earrings for a child . Very small .

In varying degrees , all -- ALL -- had waists that were bigger than 32 . And in varying degrees all but one pair out of eight were too baggy overall ( one pair was so baggy with a waist so oversize , that I could pull them off me even though they were all buttoned up ) .Some were a little longer than specified , some were a lot longer than specified ( far as I 'm concerned , that 's a good thing : I 'd rather have a tailor shorten them after a few washings , than find that after a few washings they are too short ) .Most had strange front rises that caused , in varying degrees , the dreaded codpiece bulge ( which can be simulated by grabbing from behind the upmost part of one or both -- the bulge is not always symmetrical -- inseam areas at the crotch and pulling strongly backward and upward ) ; the worst offender in this regard was the Timberwolf color , which I ordered twice in the hope that the first pair was a manufacturing mistake , but the second pair was just as bad : the Timberwolf 's codpiece bulge was even worse when viewed from the side : hideous ! As for the button fly -- that turned out to be the best thing . I 've found the button fly to be very comfortable , more comfortable than a zipper .

I give up.ADDITIONAL INFO : the different colors the 501 Originals come in , are not all made from the same denim weight . If you go to Levi 's website , you can readily learn the weight of most of the colors there . Some times a light weight is a good thing for casual wear on a hot summer day . It 's only a bad if you did n't realize you were ordering it.ONE MORE THING : 501 Shrink to Fit is NOT the same as these jeans , which are 501 Original Fit .

This book has made me a Malcolm fan ( eventually cause I was kinda mad at him through some of it ! ) We start with the birth of Anna , Andre has agreed to raise her as his own and Malcolm wont even look at her calling her an abomination . Andre takes her to a city in the clouds called Cirrus where she is betrothed to the future emperor . We all know ( from Caylin 's story ) Anna is very important to the future and God 's plan . I loved the suspense of wondering why Anna is an abomination and who her father is . I also loved how head strong she is and reminds me so much of Lilly and Caylin , but was still so unique in her own personality . I felt myself rooting for her and Malcolm throughout the whole story and cheering her on to break down the walls Malcolm had built around himself . All the while letting my heart break for both of them , while she was feeling rejected the whole time , I felt Malcolm 's pain from his past and his love of Lilly.The Watchers have always been a storyline I have loved and to be able to grow and love all of these characters and how all the stories are tied in to the previous ones . In a way I guess that makes me a little like Malcolm , growing to love all of these heroines and wanting nothing but greatness for them . While he is a little more extreme is his protectiveness off them I can only sit back and watch.All in all this was another great book from S.J .

Anna 's journey is filled with secrets , she has no clue as to what is expected of her or why , for her to be able to start to understand she is thrust into a fight to save not only her world , but countless others as well.While trying to figure out how she will fight this war , along with trying to win Malcolm 's heart , she is forced into a marriage , traveled to a world she has always wanted to help but had no idea as to how to go about doing so , loses her father , and starts to unravel secrets as to who she really is and where her family comes from.The book kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end , although it ends as a cliffie , it was still a very enjoyable read for me ...

That they both are trying to deny . That being said there were times during the book that they were utterly frustrating . Alayna is nervous and afraid of what she is feeling around Damon . Damon is taken back by not having the ability to completely control Alayna from their first meeting . He is not used to being told no , but Alayna does just that.This book kept my interest and left me ready to read the next book to learn more into what will come with Alayna and Damon . The end is definitely a cliff hanger , which meant I wasted no time in beginning book # 2 One Plea ."}, "29134": {"id": "29133", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The LR books by Briers and Lee are standalone and have at least one HEA . After reading the fifth book in another author 's series that ended with a cliffhanger , I was craving a LR to get back on track . This book aptly filled that need.When a fae and a Lycan hook up in a bar , all either expects is a night of fun . But when the beta wakes up the next morning and finds the fae is gone , he realizes he has misplaced something precious-his mate- whom he marked in a moment of drunken passion . Then he tries to find her and learns she was just traveling through town and has already headed back home . It takes a week for him to locate her and he does , along with a bathroom floor littered with plastic wands , all complete with two pink lines . He is overjoyed , but she has locked herself in her bedroom and refuses to talk to him.His alpha , who accompanied him on the trip , recognizes the green eyes of a fae he saw leaving the bar a week earlier . The eyes of his own mate . Making the decision to take their mates home with them meets unexpected resistance , but ultimately they pack up , leaving the women 's roommate , a third fae behind . None of them realize , however , that a protective spell cast toward a former boyfriend has unraveled , placing the roommate in grave danger from a near rogue wolf.I have found Briers ' books to be entertaining and engaging . Some are better than others and often the bickering is overdone , but most have been worth the time and financial investment .

I know how pharmaceutical representatives have it with providers . I work at a clinic and I know that they have it tough when they need to speak with providers . I know from experience that in order for a rep to talk to them they need something in return and it & # 8217 ; s usually food .

These are two people that will go through hell and high water in order to have a happily ever after .

It starts off where Running to You left off but the emotions that I experienced for Grayson and Alex were fear and sadness.In this story it & # 8217 ; s about the journey of Alex and Grayson in adjusting to the devastation that happened . I was happy for Harrison and Grayson to finally talking about the past and it seemed that they were able to resolve their past .

He has been hollow instead from the moment that Monica and him separated but we have to remember that if they are meant to be they will be together . I love that he loves a great concept and that is paying it forward . His way of thinking , doing showed me that he was a marvelous man with a HUGE heart . Harrison has lived a hard life and he deserves the best . Monica Green is a woman that works non stop . Her heart was broken when Harrison thought she was cheating on him . He would not hear her ; she truly did try to let him know everything that happened . When they meet again just by coincidence things are rough but soon it seems that the world is aligning and soon they will also have their happily ever after.These book by Ms. Roberts are beautifully written .

Well that is what I did with this one.This book starts out with Chloe finding out some devastating news about her fiance which ends with them calling off the wedding . Now what is she suppose to do ? She has no place to go . Her boss quickly finds out about what happened and has offered up his home to her . You learn they have known each other for a while and are actually really good friends . What they do n't expect to happen is all the Hot Pent-Up Sexual tension between them . She finds herself feeling much better having Garrett around . She quickly makes herself at home and Garrett rather enjoys having her around . He 's known for not doing relationships at all . This is such a wonderful romance . You really feel what both characters are feeling . I felt like I was right there with them . And let me tell you there are some very Steamy scenes that kept me very happy . They really tried to fight the sexual tension they had for each other . But once they stopped fighting it , they realized just how right it really felt . I loved being able to watch both Garrett and Chloe really grow together . The emotions and the ups and downs had me reeling , but in a good way .

Williams , a spin-off romantic love story of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen . While I enjoyed the first installment , Most Truly , I enjoyed this story even more.I have only read these two novellas by Williams , but her writing style is very leisurely , spare , and sometimes lyrical . This is a quiet and pensive series , which is rather odd since Jane Austen & # 8217 ; s Pride and Prejudice is Austen & # 8217 ; s most lively and spirited novel . Described as & # 8220 ; light and bright and sparkling & # 8221 ; by the author herself , that is not how I describe Miss Darcy Decides.The title has some promise , as it sounds almost gothic and fantastic , and there is an enticing element of the illicit in the story , but it is still a very sweet Regency romance . In fact , I thought Most Truly had some sexual tension while this story pretty much skips that emotion , and I found myself wishing for more.Especially since Sir Camden Sutton , the hero , is a rogue . He & # 8217 ; s rusticating in the Derbyshire countryside before he intends to take control of his neglected estate and , at the invitation of his friend , Colonel James Fitzwilliam , stays a few days at Pemberley . He meets Georgiana Darcy at a neighbor & # 8217 ; s cottage for tea . Intrigue makes a promising appearance when we discover that Miss Wilton is an unmarried pregnant woman living with her kind aunt . Camden is a reformed rake whose cousin & # 8217 ; s reprehensible behavior left Camden extremely regretful of his own dissolute life.I really liked that Camden felt he could reform and become a better person , instead of feeling completely unworthy of a future of love and romance . He is confident in his own skin and knows who he is and what he wants . Camden represents what Willoughby ( from Sense and Sensibility ) might have become , and I really like how Williams presented his character.Georgiana , Fitzwilliam Darcy & # 8217 ; s youngest sister , was almost ruined at fifteen by George Wickham . She is a quiet , sensitive , young woman , fearful of disappointing her brother again , but now she desires love and romance and finds herself attracted against her will to the enigmatic and dashing Camden . Her attraction confuses and excites her , but she is an old soul , a very mature young woman , and almost too serious for her own good . She & # 8217 ; s also a worrywart . Williams & # 8217 ; descriptions of Georgiana & # 8217 ; s emotions are lovely to read as you see her thought processes . Georgiana also recognizes that Camden needs a friend and is lonely ; she & # 8217 ; s very astute and attuned to the feelings of others.Darcy does not like Camden and makes his feelings quite clear . There are some nicely portrayed scenes where they confront one another in tense moments . Elizabeth sometimes acts as a diffuser , but Georgiana also speaks up for herself in a lovely moment.The descriptions of both the English countryside , landscape , and food are vividly and beautifully written and there are also several personal appearance descriptions , something Jane Austen herself rarely wrote . & # 8220 ; The fire played shadows against the far wall , and the canary silk curtains were drawn against the chill summer eve. & # 8221 ; ( p13 ) I would say that , except for the characters and setting , this does not feel like a Jane Austen novel , but I don & # 8217 ; t think the author intended it to be.There is some mention of God and faith , which felt out of place and , again , Jane Austen rarely wrote of spirituality , as devout as she may have been . It felt a little jarring and out of place in the story.As in Most Truly , characters from Austen & # 8217 ; s most popular novel make appearances once again : Anne de Burgh , Mary Bennet , the nasty and vindictive Caroline Bingley , Charles Bingley , and of course , Darcy and Elizabeth . And Kitty and James are just beginning their married life here.Memorable moments : & # 8220 ; It was past time to honor Sophia and all his family and friends who could no longer do as he could & # 8212 ; live with honor , with kindness , with love. & # 8221 ; ( p24 ) & # 8220 ; 'I can not undo my past . I can , however , live differently , and that I intend to. & # 8221 ; ( p41 ) & # 8220 ; Miss Bingley was just the sort the Comte liked & # 8212 ; well-bred , sharp , beautiful , with a vein of ice. & # 8221 ; ( p52 ) A genuinely pleasing and satisfying Regency romance that even Jane Austen purists will enjoy . *A modified version of this review first appeared on The Romantic Historical Reviews blog ."}, "29243": {"id": "29242", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This was a great read !

On both sides of the relationship , the people involved have to be mindfully aware of the things they say to each other and how they behave , because sometimes something so innocent as being late all the time , can cause a person to lose trust in you . This is only one example of what is talked about in this book.What I liked most was the way the author explained different ways to build trust within a couple .

His Thrawn and Conqueror 's trilogies were incredible , Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging , and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent . So I figured this would be too.First off , when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud `` Huh ? That 's it ? ! '' I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else . It is a really short story , barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales ' Star Wars series ( and those books have several of them ! ) . It 's also , I must say , a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I 've seen Zahn write . It 's not terrible , but it really is n't that great either- there 's no twists and at the end you 're left wondering where the other half of the story is . The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable ( as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops ) and though there is quite a bit of action , it kind of reads like a ( short ) movie or videogame script.Overall , not worth paying for .

Just about every sentence is a run-on sentence . I tried to ignore them , but reading them is the literary equivalent of tumbling down a hill . On one page , the average sentence was five or six lines long -- all joined together with commas and very difficult to follow comfortably.Putting aside the editing issue ( which I know the author is aware of , but has n't yet fixed ) , the novel would be 2.5 or 3 stars . The basic premise of the book -- retired police chief from Wisconsin helps solve mysteries in Palm Springs -- is n't bad , but the actual mechanics of it leave some questions . I need more back story to help me understand why a small town police chief would have the ability to be especially good at solving these mysteries ( the story of him just being a `` natural '' at profiling and even doing freelance profiling for the F.B.I . did n't ring true ) . We never really saw Henry being good at figuring things out or having special insight into people . He just sort of talks to people and the mystery solves itself . It was kind of like watching your grandpa solve a case -- not a detective grandpa , but just your regular grandpa.I also had lingering questions about the plot . The device of the autographed pictures did n't make sense . I do n't understand why somebody would be more likely to buy a house if there was an autographed picture of a celebrity in it . . . either you 're an easy mark for that sort of scam or you are n't . What was the picture supposed to convey -- that the celebrity had left an autographed picture of themselves before moving out ? It also did n't make sense that nobody on the police force wanted to solve the crime because they 'd heard rumors that the victim liked to have sex with teenage boys . Detectives ca n't just opt out of murder investigations -- they may do a halfway job , but they ca n't just call in a local volunteer.I give the author credit for attempting to create some characters that add life to the book . Wayne and Henry were too alike to be distinguishable -- they need to be able to play off of each other better if this is going to be a successful series . Charles was actually an good character and I can see the potential there . It was jarring to have him continually introduce himself with `` Heeey , '' when no other dialogue had any sort of spelling alteration to imply dialect . It was distracting and unnecessary . The character of Amit was interesting in that you could see the author 's attempt to surround Henry with characters who were very different -- Amit was young , of a different race and nationality , technically savvy , and very different in personality . Like the vast majority of the dialogue , Amit 's did n't ring true , but with more work and development ( in dialogue and character ) , I can see this being a solid group and am hoping maybe Amit is being set up as a regular character.This has the potential to be a good series . It is n't there yet , but I would check out future books if I felt the author addressed the editing , tightened plots , and focused on characterization . I think there is room in the mystery world for a detective like Henry ."}, "29339": {"id": "29338", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Can you review a novel that you did n't finish ?

Or when one of the characters when they are getting ready to pose for the calendar and watch gay couple posing says that he is relieved that heavy duty gay action was over.Guess what you dolts ? No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual . If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on , just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let 's not forget the `` he has gay friends '' thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique , contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on .

There is nothing here but bold , unfounded assertions based on the typical social justice meme that seeks to perpetuate the lifestyle of subsistence farming peasantry at the cost of everything modern and everything truly scientific.The recommendations that so many people praised with such blissful closed-minded endorsement are pretty simple:1 . Exercise more2 . Eat organic foods3 . Become a vegan or as close to it as you can tolerateWhile these suggestions are indeed fitting and appropriate for the descendants of French , Indian , Chinese , and Spanish peasants , the rest of us can not survive on such meager fare . If these ideas were so very helpful to the peasants , then why did they work so hard to abandon their ancient `` healthy '' lifestyles in favor of rebellion , destruction of the aristocracy , and modern living ? A vegan diet leaves a person physically weakened , emotionally impaired , and dependent on someone else for daily guidance . In short , it creates peasants and there is a profound move through the modern world to convince you and I and everyone they can reach that we need to become peasants who do nothing but slave away in the factories and commercial farms established by the modern elitists for the benefit of the elitists.Early onset erectile dysfunction is founded in genetics . It is the result of countless generations of humanity that did not live beyond thirty years of age because their world was violent and their climate harsh . While diet may , in some cases , have a minor impact on erectile function , it will never have the huge impact books like this one are claiming it will have . The reason a starvation diet and hard exercise can , in some cases , bring minor improvement to reproductive function is because it stresses the physical animal beyond enduring and forces the genes to seek to reproduce in a younger , stronger specimen.The suggestions in this book will be helpful , but they will not transform an impotent or semi-impotent fifty or sixty year old into a breeding stud capable of marathon sex sessions . Such claims are hyperbolic at best and downright deceptive at worst . It is a pleasant lie designed to convince men to abandon their core strengths and become mild-mannered urban dwellers who wo n't argue with police and will consistently vote for bigger government and more government intervention into their daily life.If you truly want to know why your body is failing at forty , then you need to be readingThe Selfish Gene , Principles of Paleontology , andHard Evidence : Case Studies in Forensic Anthropology.The one thing the writer does get right is that replacing the candy bars and ice cream in your diet with dried fruit and dry roasted nuts will do wonders for your emotional life , your physical life , and your sex life .

I 'm not one of those people who reads one and does n't know what she 's getting into.This historic novel is what is called magical realism . It is set in the real world but has magical elements . I like magical realism.I went back and forth on liking this one . I feel like a lot of these novels are really anti-women 's rights . I do not think that historic novels or DD ( domestic discipline ) romances have to disregard women as intelligent creatures so much . I do not think that BDSM , DD and all of that has to disregard feminism . In fact , in real life it rarely does and if it does it should be avoided.The fact that the main character is a strong woman who was born in the wrong time is fine . It makes sense that she would be beaten every time she expressed an opinion . It was awesome that she was so strong and capable but still feminine . I liked that she was able to earn some respect.The things that bothered me about this book were these : -The men in it were unrealistic pigs . They did not act like gentlemen would have acted at the time . A man of that time would have acted like a gentleman in public and the fact that he was chastising a woman would not have been publicized like it is in this novel.-Her brothers were abusive monsters.-The men acted like the main character was some horrible brat when all they needed to do was reason with her . Seriously , a polite explanation as to why she should n't do something would have gone a long way . In fact , some politeness somewhere , anywhere in the book would have been appreciated.-When she proved herself they still refused to allow her some leeway.-All the men were bullies except one and he did n't get the girl.-The characters were all fairly unlikable . If I 'm going to read a cheap romance novel I want to like the characters . The point of cheap romance novels is wish fulfillment . Literary fiction is for disappointment.-The men in this story at some point just decided that they would be unreasonable for no reason . The author was using those instances to get to the next spanking scene . However , it made it really hard to like the male characters.-The main character was smart but acted like a moron . At some point she needed to figure out how to act and how to get her way.-At one point the main male character lied to the heroine and tricked her . Then acted like he was in the right.-The thing that bothered me the most was that at the end the heroine tried to implement a change that would have advanced women 's rights . She was beaten by her husband until she promised to recant that move . Of all people her husband should have supported her .

That the central characters are a lesbian couple does n't matter in the slightest . Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko does n't sermonize about homophobia or civil unions or moral values , but rather presents a sincere , complex , and universal portrayal an American family - imperfect and at times highly turbulent , but still loving and committed . There 's no trace of Hollywood idealism ; rather , there 's the sense that we 're seeing real people living real lives with real ups and downs . Movies like this have to be treasured . They show respect for the audience . They involve you rather than make you feel like an outsider.At the center of the plot are Nic ( Annette Benning ) and Jules ( Julianne Moore ) , who have been married for a number of years and have raised two children , one born to each and conceived via an anonymous sperm donor . Despite their relatively normal upbringing , the half siblings - fifteen-year-old Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) and eighteen-year-old Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) , are curious about their biological father and decide to contact him through the sperm bank . Here enters Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) , the casual , relaxed , super cool owner of a restaurant serving organic food he has grown and harvested himself . He seems to like the kids . The kids seem to like him . The moms think he 's a little too pleased with himself , what with the way he describes his own success as the result of doing , not learning.Nic , a doctor who has always been the dominant provider , slowly begins to feel as if her world is being stolen away , the kids spending more time with Paul than she 's comfortable with . She drinks wine excessively . She has to be in control of every situation . Jules , less focused but more nurturing than Nic , begins to feel underappreciated , especially now that she has started a landscaping business . As it so happens , her first client is Paul , a turn of events that ties into a reality rarely discussed in the movies but is wisely observed here : Human sexuality is complicated , few falling into definite black and white categories . To say anything more would be too revealing , although I will say that , whatever happens , Paul will be cool with it . Others will be terribly confused . Others still will be hurt very deeply.The characters , written and played with sharp humor and heart , all have qualities that are not only realistic but relatable as well . Nic and Jules love their children and they each other , but as they eventually come to realize , marriage is hard and subject to unexpected turns . Who 's to say who was right and who was wrong in any given situation ? It 's not as clear cut as it might seem . Joni , now a legal adult and on the verge of moving away to college , is incredibly smart , although she feels pressured into being the perfect child of a lesbian couple , and she has not yet acted upon her own emerging sexuality . Laser , less bookish but greatly athletic , has trouble finding that fine line between an adrenaline rush and acts of sheer stupidity . This is especially true when in the presence of his friend , who everyone else correctly writes off as a loser and a bad influence.As for Paul , there always seems to be someone like him in our lives . He 's easy-going and open , although he does n't always think before he acts . Why , for example , did he decide to donate sperm in the first place ? Laser really would like to know . He puts a lot of selfless words in his answer , although one gets the sense that he does n't really know why he did it . Maybe it just seemed like a good idea at the time . Maybe he 's the kind of person that will try almost anything once if it seems fun enough . He 's done many things in his life , but at this stage , he 's cool with running an organic restaurant . Will he be cool with it a year from now ? Five years ? Ten ? He says at one point that he would like a family someday , although he does n't strike me as someone who thinks that far in advance . He lives for the moment . Unfortunately , that may do more harm than good when it comes to Joni and Laser - he 's their biological father , but he 's not their dad.The film is both funny and dramatic , and yet Cholodenko correctly avoids going too far in either direction . It does n't condescend . It does n't emotionally manipulate . It allows the characters and situations to evolve smoothly and naturally , so that by the end , I felt as if I had experienced something truly profound . It helps that that the performances are some of the best of any I 've seen so far this year . Benning and Moore are completely believable in their roles , developed not as tiresome gay stereotypes but as actual people in a long-term relationship ; they 're not without their flaws , but underneath it all , they 're well-meaning and decent . Wasikowska and Hutcherson play teenagers I could truly care about , both having personalities that felt genuine . Ruffalo is in top form , convincingly playing a character that , like a lot of us , has yet to figure things out . `` The Kids are All Right '' is a real winner - one of the year 's best films ."}, "29509": {"id": "29508", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "As the 180th review , few will read this .

What one sees and finds fascinating is 'the maleness ' she portrays , no doubt what she sees with all the males she connects with , a womans ' view of what men are and their predictable reactions . She plays the character to perfection , as she is capable of . The problem is that the images are generic , simplistic , and stereotypical ( also wry and humorous ) . I could see myself being viewed this way but I did n't feel my maleness captured . Some women friends , asked what makes a man different from a woman , reply 'a certain perversity to their character , and words similar . She was 'HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD ' trying to play 'MALE'.The greatness of Stepford Wives was the inability of men to be able to craft a 'perfect woman ' , either version of the film .

Although this is an ensemble cast movie , I think Annette Bening deserves most of the credit for her marvelous potrayal of Nic . Annette Bening & Julianne Moore play Nic & Jules , a middle-aged lesbian couple with two children ( conceived from a sperm donor ) . Nic ( Bening ) is a doctor . Jules ( Moore ) is a landscape designer . They have a loving and happy life with their two grown children ; Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) & Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) . But , their lives are disrupted when Joni & Laser decide to contact their sperm donor father ; Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) . That 's the basic premise . But , there is so much more to the story . Laser ( Hutcherson ) has a friend , Clay ( Eddie Hassell ) , who seems hell-bent on dangerous stunts , destroying property , and general teenage self-destruction . Paul ( Ruffalo ) is an aimless man , currently involved with a very sexy and beautiful free-spirited woman ; Tanya ( Yaya Alafia ) , until he meets his biological kids and Nic & Jules . At first , Nic welcomes him into their lives , until Paul has an affair with Jules . This is where the story gets intense ... the tearing apart of the close-knit bond between Nic & Jules , and their children . As I said , Bening is marvelous in her performance . Moore is also very good , though the filmmakers chose to film her in a way to accent every freckle , every wrinkle , and cause her to look flabby , sickly pale and generally haggard ; despite that in reality , she is a beautiful woman with a great body . Speaking purely in opinion ; I think Paul is an idiot for abandoning the great relationship he had with the sexy and beautiful Tanya in order to pursue an affair/relationship with Jules , a confirmed lesbian . But , of course , it 's necessary to the plot , as this affair is what tears the family apart .

Not a unique premise save that the parents of the kids happen to be lesbians.The entire cause c & eacute ; l & egrave ; bre for this film is to show straight America how `` normal '' gay families are and that they should n't be afraid of `` gay marriage '' or `` gay parenting , '' thus it does n't delve too deep or wander too far off topic . Political film making is a tricky business . You 'll remember the Tom Hanks drama Philadelphia was maligned by the LGBT activist fringe for all the issues it did n't address ; to which my answer has always been : it 's a two hour film , if you add too many spicy issues you 're left with an unpalatable polemic.The script and direction by Lisa Cholodenko ( High Art ) are tight , well focused and only occasionally heavy-handed . Her characters are fresh , while being stereotypically familiar to pre-conditioned movie-goers . These are folks we know , people we work with and/or live in our neighborhood : `` normal '' people . Is it perfect ? No ; there an almost fatally flawed plot contrivance that seems only there to provide the filmmaker an all too easy source of conflict.What elevates the film above the run-of-mill movie-of-the-week domestic drama is the acting . Annette Benning is staggeringly good as the head of her household - the alpha female in this case . Her performance is embarrassingly rich ; she presents a myriad of conflicting emotions , each one immediately recognizable , true and never over played . Julianne Moore turns in a lovely portrait of the less-successful , less self-assured partner . Mark Ruffalo is a revelation as a forty-something man finally approaching adulthood ; a free-spirit , still capable of making disastrously foolish decisions in his pursuit to find personal fulfillment . Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are always on target as the kids , conveying the perfect blend of angst and innocence.Just as they did with Juno and Little Miss Sunshine , the film community is falling all over themselves hyping this .

Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg make their lesbian couple no different from a typical married couple and largely avoid the clich & eacute ; s that could cause this film to be labeled a `` gay movie . `` Nic ( Annette Bening ) and Jules ( Julianne Moore ) are a married couple living in California with their two children Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) and Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) . Nic is a doctor , while Jules is trying to establish herself as a landscape designer after several failed business ventures . Their marriage is a bit rocky , but they have two well-rounded , intelligent children conceived via anonymous sperm donor . Laser , at 15 , has grown curious about his mystery father and asks his 18-year-old sister to find out who the man is . Leaving for college soon , she reluctantly agrees . The donor in question is Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) , unmarried , with no children , the owner of an organic restaurant , and naturally curious about these two kids . Joni and Laser find him cool and likable , but agree that their moms must not find out . When they do find out , they insist that Paul is invited over for dinner . Paul is so likable that only Nic remains skeptical of the man.The film is a comedy , but its humor stems from the characters ' sense of humor rather than just exploiting the characters by putting them in humorous situations . The tone is kept light , never getting too heavy but Cholodenko knows not to let dramatic opportunities go to waste . With that said , the film never overdoes the emotional stuff . Where most movies allow an emotional holocaust to unfold whenever a character finds out something devastating , The Kids Are All Right has characters that react much like real people would which makes the emotional scenes very effective and very affecting.While I do n't consider it a misstep per se , infidelity does factor into the plot . This is something we 've seen countless times , but it 's handled much better than it could 've been here . While not always unpredictable and fresh , I found this film so charming , funny , and inspired I can forgive it for being occasionally overly familiar . What this film has is a good script with great characters enriched by how great they 're played by the actors involved.Nic and Jules have been married for nearly twenty years , a marriage which Bening and Moore make believable . They 're not a perfect couple , but they 're not constantly at odds with each other either . They convey the believability of their relationship with body language and their general attitude towards each other ; assisted by the great dialogue they 're given . Both Moore and Bening are perfect and I 'd be torn to choose who gives the better performance . They both avoid the stereotypes , never emphasizing how taboo their characters may seem to some , and they bring such humor and humanity to their roles while playing them as very normal people ; two people who are married , have real emotions , and are struggling to do what 's right while working through a rough patch in their relationship.Mark Ruffalo is almost exclusively responsible for the likability of Paul . The role seems simple enough , but it 's easy to see where another actor could have brought the wrong nuance to the role and seemed immoral and somewhat immature rather than laid-back and comfortable with himself . His final scene in the film is remarkable ; despite his mistakes , you ca n't help feel some empathy for him . Ruffalo brings out Paul 's emotions in a way you really believe someone like Paul would and the way he smiles at Laser in the last moments of the scene brings a terrific amount of closure to his character . If Ruffalo and Bening are nominated for an Academy Award , this is the scene where Oscar voters would decide that . Ruffalo makes Paul one of the most likable characters of 2010 and gives the rare kind of performance that does n't need to be explosively dramatic to get recognition during awards season.The Kids Are All Right is a funny , at times touching film driven by its exceptionable cast . With a lesser cast , I admit this may have been a lesser film but sometimes everything just aligns perfectly . This is one of my favorite films of 2010 , with a cast doing some great work that I hope will be recognized . It 's not a perfect film , but it does so many things right that other films of this kind get wrong.GRADE : A-"}, "29516": {"id": "29515", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "`` The Kids are All Right '' is a comedy-drama set in California which stars Julianne Moore as Jules and Annette Bening as Nic , two halves of a married lesbian couple who are raising two children , Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) and Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) and are doing it rather well , despite some setbacks.This film plays out like a hearty home-cooked meal of a film , like `` Life as a House '' or `` Parenthood '' . The only difference is that the central couple of the film is gay . Art imitates life here , as this nuance makes no difference in how the children of this union are raised . Laser and Joni are in the process of growing up to be stable , smart and well-adjusted adults . We are given enough of a glimpse into the kids ' romantic prospects to see that the sexuality of their parents does not impact their own , but we do n't dwell on it . The film does not make a big deal of it for the simple fact that it does not matter.We get a good sense of a down-home environment here , with the only difference being that the parents are both women . Nic is of the fatherly type . She is the stricter bread-winner of the family , while Jules is her compliment . Jules is the softer side of the family , reigning Nic in when she becomes irrational . Nic is the parent you would not want to meet at the front door at 2:00 in the morning if you blew your curfew . Jules is the parent who would wipe your tears afterwards.In the typical curious fashion of young adults , Laser and Joni decide to contact their biological father , Paul , ( Mark Ruffalo ) , the sperm donor by whom both Jules and Nic were impregnated to give birth to each of the couple 's children . Joni takes instantly to Paul , while Laser is apprehensive . When the kids inform their parents that they have made contact Paul , they invite him over to get to know him a little better.The initial meeting is a bit awkward , but we get a bit of backstory on the cute way in which Jules and Nic met , which warms the heart just as any other romantic origin would . Jules ends up accepting Paul 's offer to landscape his backyard , which ends up turning the dynamic between Jules and Nic on its ear.Paul is a bohemian who grows his own vegetables and rides a motorcycle . He participates in the kinds of activities that a teenager would think are cool and therefore ends up becoming , in contrast , `` the coolest parent '' . Through him , Joni begins to find her sense of independence , while Laser feels like he ca n't quite connect with Paul and instead spends most of his time with his loser friend , Clay , whose favorite pastimes include skateboarding off of roofs and peeing on dog 's heads.Paul 's interruption in this family 's daily lives ends up challenging the strength of the family and the union between Jules and Nic . The love between the two of them is palpable and it is rewarding to see everyone remain true to who they really are by the end of the film . Paul ends up getting the short end of the stick , which seems rather unfair , but ultimately his existence here serves as a catalyst to help the family see the bigger picture and appreciate what they already have . `` The Kids Are All Right '' is a film about a family like any other . Upon completion , you will feel like you just finished a great book .

I could not stand 20 minutes watching `` Cats and Dogs , the revenge of kitty Galore '' , which is also a first for me . `` The kids are all right '' started with porn and perverted sex that could easily sway people to avoid the movie theater . From the start to end , the lesbian breadwinner portrayed a mean and ugly image of human existence , with foul language and obsession with anal and genital imagery in every theme of her reasoning.The choice of characters was perfect . The dominant female lacks any feminine attraction , mimics the hash and crude masculine aggression and dominance and relies on financial power to subdue her sexual target . The subordinate female partner lacks security and self esteem and must rely on the breadwinner to ensure her survival . The two siblings have no alternative but love and accept those who made their survival all possible . With such shaky dependence , everyone is entrapped for life . The weak is shackled by guilt and debt . The dominant fears the breeze of fresh air . The innocent kids must assimilate the guilt of their parents with the confusion of growing up.The first offspring went to college with big hugs , kisses , and plenty of tears and must be grateful for the rest of her life for such unconditional support . The second offspring returned home for few years of figuring out why lesbian women entertain gay sex . The two lesbian lovers have convinced themselves long enough that they were duly married and that their love could live a little longer . The sperm donor spread his sperms everywhere he could possibly reach with little chance to settle roots.The movie `` Splice '' made a similar argument of tampering with human and animal genes and ending up with a monstrous creature . Here , the monster lies within . The fear , the confusion , the lack of faith , the daily and frequent use of vulgar language , the alcohol , and the smoking all turned existence into unabated suffering ."}, "29520": {"id": "29519", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "****1/2One of the most striking things about the `` feel-good '' drama `` The Kids Are All Right '' is that the characters are not always all that easy to like . They can be moody and naggy , petulant and prickly , immature and self-absorbed ; they do and say a lot of stupid , immoral and hurtful things - yet we never question the love they have for one another.Annette Benning and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules , a middle-aged lesbian couple with two teenaged children , 18-year-old Joni ( Mia Wasikowaski ) , who is all set to go off to college , and 15 year-old Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) , who 's become suddenly curious about the anonymous sperm donor who is his biological father . After some initial hesitation on the part of Joni , the youngsters set up a meeting with the man , a never-married , motorcycle-riding restaurateur and all-around free spirit named Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) , whose sudden insinuating of himself into the life of the family results in a great deal of consternation and tension for all concerned.The relationship dynamics in the screenplay by Stuart Bloomberg and director Lisa Cholodenko are intense and complex . With a career as an obstetrician , Nic is the more `` grounded '' of the two women , even though she may be a borderline alcoholic and secretly resents the fact that the more fitfully employed Jules does n't seem to be able to pull her own weight financially . This leads to a tremendous amount of tension between the two , a condition that is greatly exacerbated when the less self-confident and less uptight Jules steps across a clearly forbidden line in their marriage . Nic and Jules also seem to be suffering from the `` fatigue-factor '' that seems to creep into just about every relationship once the individuals have been together for too long . They have even begun to question their feelings for one another , and wonder if the love that was once there so intensely still exists at all - or whether they 're just staying together because it ` s safe and comfortable to do so and the thought of starting over with someone else is just too daunting a prospect to seriously contemplate.Meanwhile , Paul falls in love with the idea of becoming a dad to two grown kids he clearly likes , but his own unrealistic expectations and lack of maturity threaten to doom any efforts in that direction . The kids , meanwhile , who often seem more keenly aware of what is going on than the adults involved , frequently become collateral damage in the battle of relationships being waged around them.Benning , who 's already garnered universal praise and numerous awards for her work in this film , is not afraid to bring a harsh edge to the role of the often overbearing Nic , almost daring the audience not to like her at times . Moore has the less flashy part , but she nicely conveys the insecurity and vulnerability of the character she ` s playing . Ruffalo perfectly captures the well-meaning clumsiness of a man too long used to being focused on his own needs and desires to suddenly become a man dedicated to the lives of others . And Wasikowska and Hutcherson are appealing and touching as the kids who may be all right in the long run but who are going through some pretty tough times at the moment.The major selling point of `` The Kids Are All Right '' is , of course , that it centers around what many in society see as an `` unconventional '' family , yet the movie itself could n't be more universal in what it has to say about what it means to be a family and what it means to be in a committed relationship . Marriage and family are both demanding , complex and messy things - no matter the genders or orientations of the people involved - and this film drives home that fact with unerring truth ."}, "29521": {"id": "29520", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is one of those modern , unconventional California families : two lesbian moms who have given birth to a son and daughter by way of a sperm donor , whom the kids choose to meet when they get old enough to do so .

Scott , an unlikely heartbreaker who has a habit of going through girlfriends like he goes through those stylish graphic t-shirts he wears , is dating 17 year-old Knives Chau ( Ellen Wong ) while trying to get over his previous valet , Envy Adams ( Brie Larson ) . But Scott breaks it off with Knives when he encounters Ramona Flowers ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) , deadpan Amazon delivery girl who dyes her hair a different color every week . But if Scott is to keep dating Ramona , he must defeat her seven evil exes , such as mystically powered Matthew Patel ( Satya Bhabha ) , movie star Lucas Lee ( Chris Evans ) , superpowered vegan Todd Ingram ( Brandon Routh ) , and music mogul Gideon Graves ( Jason Schwartzman ) in video game-inspired combat , all while trying to win a record deal in a Battle of the Bands competition.Recent movie adaptations of comic books have attempted to ground themselves in realism . However , Scott Pilgrim vs The World , directed by Edgar Wright ( Shaun of the Dead , Hot Fuzz ) adapted from the Bryan Lee O'Malley 's series of books , gleefully embraces the surreal elements of its source material . The books reference and utilize tropes from video games , comic books , and Japanese anime and manga , and the film also utilizes those elements with splashy effect . When characters get punched , graphics like `` Poom ! '' and `` K-Row ! '' pop up on screen . When a bell rings , the word `` R-I-I-I-I-N-G ! '' flies across the screen . Characters launch into high-flying kung-fu battles while those around them look on without much shock . And when characters are defeated in battle , they burst into a pile of coins . It is one of the most literal interpretations of a comic book ever committed to film , and you could hold drinking games for all the references the film makes to popular - and not so popular - culture ( The Legend of Zelda , Final Fantasy , Seinfeld , Dance Dance Revolution , just to name a few ) . What the film lacks in realism , it more than makes up for with sheer fun in the absurdity of it all.It 's also worth mentioning the fun array of characters brought to life by the actors portraying them . Michael Cera seems to be amounting a good fortune by playing awkward losers , so whether you like him or hate him , he fits the role rather well . And for once , his character `` mans up '' toward the end of the film . Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Ramona as a dry , aloof girl trying to escape the broken relationships of her past . Ellen Wong 's Knives Chau is a hyper-emotional schoolgirl straight out of Japanese anime and manga , and Kieran Culkin steals just about every scene he 's in as Wallace , Scott 's `` cool gay roommate , '' who acts as Scott 's personal peanut gallery during Scott 's battles.Scott Pilgrim vs .

It seemed like it was all FLASH and no SUBSTANCE , as with most summer films . This struck me as particularly heartbreaking because Wright 's previous work meant so much to me.Fast forward to the Blu Ray release ... Watching this movie at home , and having a son who read the books AND is an avid gamer , really helped me sort things out and find the humor amid all the bells and whistles . Do n't get me wrong , I found some significant humor in my initial viewing but knowing what the little subreferences mean helped tremendously.I have to admit , it 's become a favorite of mine ... and Brandon Routh 's portrayal as Clash At Demonhead 's vegan supreme bassist Todd is one of my favorite movie moments of all time .

I am told that it follows the comic books really closely.Definitely a cool movie ."}, "29531": {"id": "29530", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 'll admit that the first time I watched Scott Pilgrim I did n't entirely buy into the hype . I liked the film , but a lot of people have had such great affection for this movie I did n't really see what the big deal was . Watching the film a second time , I was astounded by how much I liked it . If another more inventive film was released in 2010 , I did n't see it.The story is based on a graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley , but I 've never read or even seen a physical copy of this series so my review for the film is based on the film 's own merit.The film takes place in Toronto , Canada where Scott Pilgrim ( Michael Cera ) , a 22-year-old , plays bass in a band called Sex-Bob-omb , lives with a gay roommate ( Kieran Culkin ) , and is dating a 17-year-old high school girl named Knives Chau ( Ellen Wong ) . After Scott meets the girl of his dreams ( literally ) , American Ramona Flowers ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead , whom I found incredibly attractive in this film ) , everything seems to fall into place . The only problem is , if he wants to date Ramona he must battle and defeat her seven evil exes.Much of the cast is filled with familiar faces including Brandon Routh , Chris Evans , Anna Kendrick , and the terrific Jason Schwartzman and all the actors within seem to be having a lot of fun . It 's true that Michael Cera is basically playing the character we are accustomed to seeing him play , yet he fits this role perfectly . I ca n't imagine an actor more perfect to portray Scott Pilgrim.Now , a lot of people take certain movies too seriously . They can suspend their disbelief for a movie like Transformers , but when they 're watching a film that begins as a highly-stylized romance and suddenly turns into a cinematic video-game , they have issues accepting it . I admit that this is not a movie for everyone , but those who call it `` stupid '' simply do n't `` get it . '' That 's not to say you do n't `` get it '' if you just do n't like the film , but no one can dispute that this is an intelligent , well-rendered film . With that said , I am 18-years-old and while watching the film I wondered if it would or could be enjoyed and appreciated by someone much older than myself . The creative elements throughout the film ( even much of the dialogue ) are representative of the years I grew up in and on many people of my generation . While no one can really say until years from now , I think that , in a way , Scott Pilgrim may be more of a `` generation-defining '' film than The Social Network.Edgar Wright co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Bacall and I was surprised by how well-written the film is . To a lot of people , Scott Pilgrim functions most noticeably on a visual level but the writing is both fun and energetic . The humor will definitely only appeal to certain tastes , but I found it quite witty . The dialogue is written in a quirky , witty highly-stylized ( a description that can be used to describe most everything about this film ) lingo that , while memorable , does n't become an annoyance as it did in Juno . The writing is really the heart of the story for in-between the extravagant action sequences , there 's a nice love story with likable characters.What elevates this material significantly is the creative vision of director Edgar Wright . Not being a reader of comics or a player of video games , I may be a little out of my element here but , I do n't believe another director has come closer to bringing both a comic book and a video game to the screen than Wright has with this film . The battle scenes are literally a video game put to film , with Scott even picking up tokens after defeating Ramona 's exes . While I 'm not a gamer , I recognized many of the video game references and there are many of them , with even the Universal logo being one . The way Wright chooses to film the smallest things , like the unique look of Sex-Bob-omb playing , is delightfully clever . It 's clear that Wright put every ounce of creative energy he had into creating this world and I ca n't imagine another director pulling it off as flawlessly as he does . It 's too early to call the film innovative , but I 've never seen anything like it . While marketing has made it look like a teen action-comedy , Scott Pilgrim is a highly artistic film with vibrant imagery and boundless energy . Even the soundtrack , fashioned by Nigel Goodrich , is energetic ( there 's that word again ) and atmospheric while not being something I generally listen to.Scott Pilgrim is not an intellectual film , but it is a high-minded one . While I do n't know if it 's a comment on the videogame/hipster subculture , a satire of various trends , a homage to those trends , or a combination of everything I do recognize it as a terrific skewering of pop culture . Whatever the case , Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most inventive , original film of 2010 that I enjoyed and appreciated even more the second time around . While it was not a box office success , it 's already gathered a substantial fanbase and I predict this film will become a certifiable cult classic with the appreciation , love , and respect for it only growing as the years pass by.GRADE : A-"}, "29532": {"id": "29531", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This movie is amazing ! ! !

A best selling novel ends up omitting the things people loved about it for the flashier scenes . A TV series has the heart of it tossed aside for the shiny surface of the recognizable characters . And comic books are more often than not done as if the film makers had a fear of making a movie that , well , looks like a comic book . Until recently comic book based films tossed aside all that made them what fans loved and instead turned them into stereotypical films that used the characters names and little more.SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD is not one of those films . Director Edgar Wright , who made SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ , understands what fans of this comic book loved . The quirkiness of the characters , the unimaginable situations and the slam bang fight sequences that comics fans adore . Yes Wright understands these things , gets the fact that comic fans look for them and doses them out slowly but surely here.Scott Pilgrim ( Michael Cera ) is an early twenties something guitar player in a band that has yet to find success . Having recently found a new girlfriend in high school student Knives Chau ( Ellen Wong ) , things are looking up . The band has an important gig coming up that may land them an actual contract and a chance at being paid . And then Scott sees Ramona Flowers ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) .Quickly dumping Knives , Scott sets his sights on Ramona , attempting to gain her favor . The pair eventually take a liking to one another . But then something odd happens . One of Ramona 's ex lovers ' shows up and challenges Scott to a duel to the death . For some odd reason , all of Ramona 's seven ex lovers must battle anyone who wants to be her new boyfriend , an unfortunate circumstance for Scott.Until this point the movie seems a bit slow , but that 's all to set up what follows . We get to know the characters , where they stand in one another 's lives and how they fit into the story . Once the ex lovers appear to duke it out with Scott , the film veers quickly into the whole comic book world of ultra violence that never gets much more serious than a Road Runner cartoon . Kicks land people across rooms , into skyscrapers and disappearing . And no one ever questions if this is right or not let alone police showing up to ask what happened . It 's accepted as part of the story.As the ex lover count winds down we finally find out the real reason for the battles , just how they began and why Scott must defeat each one if he is to claim the hand of Ramona . It 's an interesting journey and one that offers some dynamic visuals and fight sequences . Keep in mind though this is n't a serious film by any means but more of a fun filled adventure with plenty of humor.So is it a good movie ? Yes , it is , though as I said you have to give it a bit of time for it all to come together . As it began I found myself thinking oh no , another Michael Cera movie where he 's all teen angst and he 's a goofy dorky nerd who ca n't put a sentence together without seeming pathetic . But it is n't that at all . And while I 'm not the biggest fan of Cera , he actually does a good job here as does the entire cast.But it 's the comic book come to life portion of this movie that makes it worthwhile . Not just in the fact that this world involves seven ex lovers who come back not to reunite with their past girlfriend but to stop her from having someone new in her life , no that 's not enough . We even get the chance to have the long loved graphically displayed sound effects projected on screen for us . If `` POW ! '' is the word on the page then `` POW ! '' actually shows on the screen.I 've only read on SCOTT PILGRIM comic and was n't thrilled with it . I am a fan of Edgar Wright though . And with this film he solidifies his role as one of the better directors that have come along in some time . While this film did n't find the audience that the studio thought it would , it might be one of those films that finds an audience on DVD . If you 're looking for something a little different , a little fun and definitely tied to the world of comics , you wo n't do much better right now than SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD ."}, "29535": {"id": "29534", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I had no idea what to expect from this movie .

'' This eternal clash between good and evil is the backbone of Christian faith , and Marcus understands that . Growing up in Baton Rouge as the son of a preacher , he was groomed to become one himself at a very early age ; looking back on his life , he admits to the camera that , while he learned plenty about behaving like a preacher , he never really learned about what he was preaching . He plays the part of the pious evangelical beautifully - boisterous , flashy , always with the loud , slick talk about Jesus and God the Father Almighty and crying , `` Amen ! '' But what does he really believe ? He is n't sure when the film starts , but when the film ends ... let 's just say that , at that point , a crisis of faith is the least of his problems.Of one thing , he has become certain : Demons do n't exist . Having performed many exorcisms , he candidly explains that , although he has never been a doctor , he has served as a healer for those who believed they needed healing . All he had to do was put on a performance and maybe sneak in a few special effects . But then came news of a supposedly possessed autistic boy that was suffocated to death during an exorcism ; for Marcus , a line had been crossed . What if that had been his own son , who survived after being born prematurely ? How could he continue pretending to cast out demons knowing that medicine and not Jesus Christ saved his son ? His new mission in life has been to expose the phoniness of exorcisms as well as to rescue victimized children . Hence this documentary.The first ten minutes of `` The Last Exorcism '' develop the Cotton Marcus character so well , he effectively draws the audience into a plot that , when viewed from a distance , is relentlessly absurd . This is the newest in a long line of faux documentaries compiled from `` recovered footage , '' which is to say that it 's by no means a groundbreaking horror film . Nevertheless , it 's thoroughly entertaining , and at times , it 's quite frightening . I only take issue with the film 's final five minutes , a scene so visually and structurally unoriginal that it surpasses routine and becomes an anticlimax . If there 's anything we 've learned from the good horror movies , it 's that certain things are better left to the imagination - to explain everything is to ruin the suspense . Had I been one of the producers , I would have fought tooth and nail for a reshoot of the ending.But I 'm getting way ahead of the story . Marcus , who 's constantly sent exorcism requests , responds to a letter from a man claiming that his teenage daughter is possessed . He travels to a remote farmhouse with his producer and cameraman , where they meet the Sweetzer family . The teenage son , Caleb ( Caleb Landry Jones ) , always seems to know more than he lets on , and is often highly intimidating . The father , Louis ( Louis Herthum ) , is devoutly religious , deeply troubled since the death of his wife , and alarmingly overprotective of his daughter , Nell ( Ashley Bell ) , who he believes is afflicted with a demon . How else to explain his slaughtered livestock and the blood that always appears on Nell 's clothing in the morning ? How else to explain the nights of endless screaming ? Marcus has seen and heard all this before . The sleepless nights , the dead animals , the blood - it 's a textbook case as far as he 's concerned . After meeting the nervous but nonetheless good natured Nell , he reveals to the camera his tricks for creating a convincing exorcism , including rigging a bedroom with fishing wire , hiding speakers in strategic places , and playing spooky sound effects at the push of a button . He then puts on a show , Nell and her father none the wiser . Marcus tells them that the demon has been exorcised . Father and daughter are relieved . Marcus and his crew leave , believing it to be another open and shut case . Things start going wrong , however , when Nell suddenly appears the crew 's motel room , her eyes glazed over , her actions highly provocative . How did she get there ? The motel is miles away from her home . Upon taking her to the hospital , Marcus stresses that what she really needs is a psychological examination , not more religious rhetoric.And from here , the film gets increasingly more conventional . Conventional and nauseating , the ever reliable Queasy Cam put to full use . Marcus and his team return to the farmhouse . Nell has periods of erratic , violent behavior , only to emerge from them unaware of what she had done . Disturbing drawings prove to have been prophetic , such as that of a white cat coated in blood and with X 's for eyes . Suspicions are aroused . Marcus finds it harder to play the part of an evangelical minister , for his real goal is to get Nell out of the house and into a psychiatric ward . Although shaken by the night 's unsettling events , he remains unconvinced Nell is genuinely possessed . I dare not reveal whether or not this is the case . `` The Last Exorcism '' would have been a much better film if it had done the same thing . Given the wonderful development of the Marcus character , given how frighteningly enjoyable most of the film is , it 's unfortunate that director Daniel Stamm opted for an ending that unsuccessfully goes for the obvious ."}, "29563": {"id": "29562", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I loved this movie .

During the course of the film he demonstrates his `` demonic '' sound-producing equipment and a battery operated smoking crucifix.Marcus brings a camera along to the home of his last `` possessed '' adherent , a young girl named Nell , who lives on an isolated farm with her hostile brother and gun-toting father . Farm animals have been found mutilated on the premises . The father is convinced that Nell has killed them .

Marcus is convinced that mental illness is to blame , but the Bible-intoxicated father insists on another round of exorcism.As the story progresses , the viewer is left to wonder if the father , the brother or the daughter is the perpetrator .

While there is nothing wrong with that formula from a business point of view , it does serve to clutter/bog down the cinemas with largely irreverent fare . Fortunately , `` The Next Three Days '' is a shining example of how a film SHOULD be made.For a basic plot summary , this film focuses on the Brennan family . When wife Lara ( Elizabeth Banks ) is imprisoned for 20 years on a murder charge ( her guilt/innocence is unknown until later on in the movie ) , husband John ( Russell Crowe ) hatches a scheme to break her out and take their son Luke out of the country to start a new life together . Along the way , John Brennan gets advice from a former prison escapee ( Liam Neeson ) , must piece together a plan , and then finally decide if he deems himself capable of pulling it off.This movie will not immediately jump to the top of your `` all-time favorites '' list .

It 's simple ( yet cognitive ) entertainment at its finest : sit back , immerse yourself , and stay along for the satisfying ride.Besides the immersive storyline , the acting is also an `` added bonus '' . Crowe and Banks are quite capable of carrying the leading roles , while Neeson , Olivia Wilde , Daniel Stern & even Brian Dennehy have excellent supporting roles , as small as they may be .

True , some may say that the beginning starts off a little slow ; but I think it sets the stage for character development and in that case it 's worth it .

We also see just how happy and gratified John and Lara are with their lives : they are very much in love with one another and they adore their beautiful three year old son , Luke ( Tyler Green ) . Suddenly one morning , however , the police and many detectives barge in and arrest Lara for the murder of her boss ; Lara is convicted of this murder even though she says she did n't do it . But they have the evidence : people at work saw Lara fighting many times with her boss ; Lara 's fingerprints are at the scene of the crime ; and her boss 's blood stain is on her coat.Three years pass as John faithfully makes his trips to the prison , sometimes with their now six year old son Luke ( who is now played by Ty Simpkins ) . John is greatly pained at Lara 's emotional deterioration ; she tries to kill herself after all legal appeals have failed and she even angrily tells John that she did commit the murder ! John , however , does n't believe Lara did it , not even for a moment.John realizes that he ca n't be without Lara : she is being transferred to another correctional facility far away and her mental health is only getting worse and worse .

The trailer , and many critical reviews I 've read , do n't do it justice . But writer/director Paul Haggis came through here in my opinion with a gripping drama that starts slow , but builds the stakes to a good climax . It definitely reminded me of the now classic Harrison Ford vehicle , The Fugitive ( 1993 ) . But it was a fresh twist on an old concept . It even has a bit of Enemy of the State ( 1998 ) and director Tony Scott 's iconic style mixed in for good measure.The concept of The Next Three Days is pretty simple . It 's a story about a family of three who are living the idyllic modern suburban lifestyle . Elizabeth Banks plays the mother , and seemingly the breadwinner , in the family . One morning , their calm house is stormed by the police and Banks ' character is arrested and charged with murder of her female boss at work . The story pretty much jumps forward three years to where Banks is locked up in jail for life after being found guilty in court . Her husband , played by Russell Crowe , does n't believe she 's guilty for a minute , but they could never find evidence of her innocence or the actual killer to take the blame for the crime . Banks ' character ca n't seem to deal with the loss of her life and attempts suicide , adding to the pressure that Crowe and their son already feel from their fractured family . So Crowe decides he has to break Banks out of jail . And he finds out exactly what thats going to take from ex-convict Liam Neeson . The rest of the plot goes where you are probably guessing it goes . So I 'll let the film fill in the rest.I will say that some of the `` extraordinary '' ( or coincidental ) circumstances and events within the story make one suspend belief in order to really enjoy the film . Usually these kind of unrealistic and overly `` lucky '' sequence of events take me out of a film to a degree . But somehow , Haggis and Crowe and the rest of the cast and filmmakers pulled it off with this one . I can see how some film critics and viewers of the film might not let the far fetched conceits of the film work for them . But as I 've written before , movies by definition are creating a `` fantastical '' world in which they exist . Every sci-fi or alien movie requires one to suspend belief to some degree . And just because The Next Three Days does n't live in one of those genres , does n't mean that it ca n't ask you to suspend your sense of realism . Enough said ! There 's no doubt in my mind that one of the key aspects of the success of The Next Three Days is Russell Crowe 's performance . He plays a middle-aged , slightly overweight , married father quite well . And yet he also transforms during the course of the movie into a badass criminal . All at the same time he remains a caring father and loving husband . And I think it 's that process of personal transformation with his character that makes the film interesting . The first hour of the film is a little too slow in that process maybe , but it does really build-up to the engaging third act of the movie . I think maybe the writing and editing could have been a little tighter to keep the movie moving along more . But after listening to an Apple `` Meet The Filmmaker '' podcast with director Paul Haggis defending his purposely slow build-up in the first half of the film , I can also buy into that philosophy . But I think if the film did have a little faster pace to it , it would elevate the film to higher level at least in my eyes . Nonetheless , this is a successful film and it works.The production values in The Next Three Days are really solid like so many films today . The cinematography from St & eacute ; phane Fontaine is good , but nothing I have n't seen before . The production design by Laurence Bennett is also well done and gives us very realistic sets and locations for the story to take place in . Sound Editing led by Renee Tondelli is really well executed with a full array of surround sounds we all expect now in an action film of this type . And I was very impressed with Danny Elfman 's music . He continues to shine and gives this film a better score than one like this typically gets . And I do think that is part of what helps elevate The Next Three Days above its peers like Unstoppable ( 2010 ) .I missed seeing The Next Three Days in the theater last year , but it was a nice surprise seeing it in HD recently . I continue to be amazed at how much better many movies look at home on blu-ray or in HD than they do in the theater . The theaters really need to invest in modern digital projection technology and bring back the aura of the cineplex . While I ca n't make the direct comparison here , my intuition tells me that I did n't miss anything in this film 's theatrical presentation . And I could n't have asked for a better home theater presentation . The high definition mastering of this film is about as good as it gets . So give your living room an aural shake-up with The Next Three Days ."}, "29594": {"id": "29593", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This movie has a fascinating plot and great acting .

As depicted in the film , when the controversial `` Rite of Spring '' was first produced by the Ballets Russes in 1913 , Chanel was one of the few in the audience who was deeply impressed by the composer 's genius . From that event , she thereafter invites Igor Stravinsky to be a quasi-permanent guest at her villa in the country ; it is there she seduces the maestro.I wanted to like the picture more than I did . Certainly the music of the `` Rite of Spring '' - which holds the picture together - is intrinsically thrilling and dramatic . The glimpse of the ballet as it may have been initially produced is intriguing . ( For the full ballet , I do recommend the recently released : `` Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes '' on DVD . ) But ultimately the story does not explain how the affair impacted either Stravinsky 's or Chanel 's individual creative projects . And the affair itself does not light up the screen - it is almost lukewarm.The quote I picked for the title of this review is the line that shocked me in the film - when Stravinsky quips at Coco Chanel ... and wrongfully at that . Everyone in fashion understands how much of a genius and artist Chanel was . Indeed the gorgeous villa that Chanel decorated is explicitly shown in the movie . It clearly exhibits the bold , simplistic , immeasurably compelling talent of Chanel . The film - which I said earlier is beautifully shot - shows the performance in the Opera House in the Champs-Elysee . It also uses historic costumes from the real Chanel collections.A theme in the latter half of the picture is the impact of the love affair on the neglected wife of Stravinsky who was dangerously ill ; the wife 's accusations of immorality against Coco Chanel do not phase the couturier . After all , Chanel apologizes to no one for her independence.Nonetheless , my favorite Chanel movie remains the documentary - `` Chanel , Chanel . '' And as fictional drama , I actually did prefer `` Coco Before Chanel '' , a movie most highly recommended by Roger Ebert . But Chanel enthusiasts wil see `` Coco Chanel and Igor Stravnisky '' ... definitely ."}, "29610": {"id": "29609", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Alan Resnais is probably the last survivor and shares with Erich Romer the honor of being the most intellectual filmmakers of the extinct French New Wave .

I know that might sound strange , but most people there enjoyed the service . There were good stories , laughter and plenty of food afterward . It was a party . Really , the only thing missing was my Dad . I wish he could have been there.In recently released film , `` Get Low '' , the character Felix Bush ( Robert Duvall ) wants to attend his own funeral . He wants to throw a `` funeral party . '' He says he wants to give people an opportunity to tell their stories about him . But Bush does not expect the stories to be humorous or heartwarming . He has lived for forty years as a hermit with a reputation as a violent lunatic.Bush first goes to the local pastor and asks if he can buy himself a funeral , but the pastor ( Gerald McRaney ) astutely observes that Bush is trying to buy forgiveness . He tells Bush that forgiveness can not be purchased but is a free gift of God . We must confess our sin and receive the free gift through Christ 's sacrifice . Bush leaves and finds a funeral home director ( Bill Murray ) who is more than happy to take his money for a `` funeral party '' .As the film follows the preparations for the funeral , we begin to learn more of Bush 's story in bits and pieces . We learn about his sin and his ultimate failure to atone for it on his own , but forgiveness and restoration is found . `` Get Low '' is based on a true story , set in Tennessee of the 1930 's . Told at a leisurely pace , the story does not offer summer distractions of CGI effects and explosions ( okay , there is a fire at the beginning of the film ) , but it does offer its own pleasures.Bill Murray offers his dry wit within a character of that time and place . Murray has been funny for over thirty years now , while many other comedians have worn out their welcome.In fact , one of the real joys of the film is seeing old faces . Hollywood has always celebrated youth and `` physical perfection '' . But there is a special pleasure in seeing the aged faces of Duvall and Sissy Spacek . Celebrated actors when they were making films decades ago in classics like `` The Godfather '' and `` Apocalypse Now '' , `` Carrie '' and `` Coal Miner 's Daughter '' respectively , neither was known primarily for looks . But now there is a definite pleasure in seeing the lines and spots of age in faces of such fully lived lives . `` Get Low '' can be seen as the third film in Duvall 's faith trilogy , the first two being `` Tender Mercies '' and `` The Apostle '' . `` Tender Mercies '' won Duvall the Oscar for Best Actor and earned another Oscar for screen writer Horton Foote . ( It is probably not a coincidence that Gerald McRaney 's character in `` Get Low '' is Pastor Horton . ) `` Tender Mercies '' features one of the most realistic and moving depictions of a man 's gradual conversion to Christianity in any film . `` The Apostle '' was written and directed by Duvall himself . There is no shortage in American media of depictions of clergy who fall into sin and hypocrisy . But this film does so with even more powerful depictions of God 's love and grace.Each of these films is like a true Christian funeral .

Despite his advanced age the local townspeople hate , and fear this old stranger who lives in seclusion . After hearing of the death of an old friend , Felix decides to orchestrate a mock funeral in order to finally publicly confess , and atone for his mortal sin . He is helped in this endeavor by undertaker Frank Quinn ( Bill Murray ) and his warm newly married assistant Buddy ( Lucas Black ) . Frank Quinn a slick salesman and opportunist from Chicago will have no compunctions about setting up this bizarre funeral party despite its moral ambiguity . And so our bittersweet drama begins with Duvall 's wonderfully strong stoic performance contrasted by Murray 's blistering deadpan gestures , and remarks concerning the whole matter . It 's their counterpointing characters like Godzilla meets King Kong that saves this movie from being too preachy , and redemptive . Thankfully it is neither but rather a good tender hearted story , well paced with great acting .

What a guy ! `` ) , Mil Mascaras Vs. the Aztec Mummy is a lucha lover 's dream come true . Mascaras , still in phenomenal shape for a man in his mid-sixties , carries this film on his shoulders as he would an opponent in an airplane spin .

It 's up to The Man of a Thousand Masks to rescue mankind from the fate in store for it . In between the all-important wrestling matches , of course.This movie offered at least as many laughs as the many masks for which Mascaras is famous . One of my favorite bits came following a publicity photo shoot ( another all-important event taking place while the earth trembles ) Mascaras does with twin girl models . The twins approach and come on to him , inviting him back to their place . Slightly shocked , the ever-virtuous Mascaras politely declines their invitation .

Although Amanda King , divorced mother of two boys , is unable to deliver the package as Lee asked , she ends up helping him to solve the case he 's working on and joins the Agency herself . She becomes Lee 's friend and partner , and later , the two of them fall in love . Amanda offers Lee a unique point-of-view on things because she understands more about ordinary civilian life than the regular agents do . At times , the series might seem a little corny because of the way a group of trained secret agents comes to rely on an ordinary suburban housewife , but it 's all in fun . Personally , I find the shows hilarious , with the clashes between Mrs. King 's nave yet practical approach to situations and Scarecrow 's professional experience , particularly since Mrs. King has to go to great lengths to keep her family from finding out that she has become a spy.Most of the shows take place around Washington D.C. and Virginia , but this season features some episodes which take place in other countries . The episodes in season 2 are:1 . To Catch a Mongoose - Lee and Amanda are in London on the trail of an assassin who might be an old classmate of Amanda's.2 . The Times They Are a Changin ' - Amanda and her family win a trip to Germany , only the contest was actually a ploy made up by the Agency so Amanda would have a chance to act as a courier between Lee and a former ` 60s radical who may be forced to kill someone.3 . Double Agent - A disgruntled former agent writes a book exposing some of the Agency 's secrets , including their use of civilians like Amanda . However , he is murdered before the book gets published , and Lee and Amanda must find the killer and the manuscript.4 . The Legend of Das Geisterschloss - Emily ( played by Jean Stapleton ) , a British agent and an old friend of Lee 's , disappears while visiting Austria .

Now onto the show.I watched the second season originally from the local library ( yes my library has many copies of this season ) , though it took me a few weeks to get bumped up on the request list . I had recently finished season one and was craving more of the delightful comedy of this series.Though season one may have been a little more fun , there is plenty of hilarity during this season . For those who do n't know , this series was created by the team that brought Frasier to us . Quality shows both . The writing is excellent and the actors play well to their talents and stay true to their characters.What this show is about is making odd family and lifestyle situations work in a crazy and fast paced world . The show is actually set up as a Scandanavian reality show . I do n't know if this was ever mentioned on the actual show , but it is mentioned on the website and mentioned during the commentary in season one . I think it was for Norwegian television . They wanted a reality show showing a slice of American family life . So that is why you have the periodic asides where family members talk to the camera , or the occasional sideways glance at the camera during normal scenes.If you have n't seen the show , you should probably catch a few of the early episodes of season one , but it is not required . There are n't really any spoilers and each episode pretty much stands alone with few story arcs carrying over to multiple episodes.One actor who delighted me by appearing was Nathan Lane playing 'Pepper ' . Hilarious ! This is not your ordinary family life drama . It features one somewhat normal appearing household that ends up being the most dysfunctional of the bunch , a gay couple with an adopted Asian daughter , and an older , rich guy with a much younger , hot Colombian wife and her son .

I look forward to it every week . The drama has been greatly enhanced by several developments in the plot and characterization.First , Michael J . Fox has been added to the cast . He does n't have a big role but when he is on , he is great . He is a lawyer who will do anything to win his case , including using his significant physical disabilities in order to win the jury 's sympathy and understanding . He tries to lure Alicia into his firm and I can see that becoming a real viability for season three . One thing he can do is an incredible job at winning his case during the day and then putting it away at night when he turns to his long term marriage and family . This no other character on the show can manage to achieve , especially Alicia.Alicia 's husband has been kind of the bad guy throughout whereas her old boyfriend , now law boss , has been seen as the good guy . These lines have been considerably blurred this season . There is an element of ruthlessness to both men this season . However , Chris Noth as the husband , comes across as untrustworthy in every frame . You do not grow to like him . Ironically , this is a change for Noth who more familiarly played the `` good cop '' on shows such as Law & Order.The very best though are the characters of Alicia and her best friend , her firm 's detective . There is a terrific crescendo which builds in the second season which involves both of them and the potential to make them enemies instead . I ca n't say more because this is something you want to watch develop on your own.Eli is becoming a favorite of mine too and he is especially great this season when he is attracted to a new character , the former star of UGLY BETTY . Slowly you begin to see Eli like and respect Alicia a lot more than his political client , her husband . Alicia and Eli have come a long way together without becoming love interests.Everyone else does a great job too but I have outlined my favorite characters and developments in the show ."}, "29695": {"id": "29694", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This series never disappoints .

She does a good job of maintaining a screen presence not in spite of age and demeanor , but because of it . The show still has the same ridiculous late discovery stuff that would never be permitted in a real courtroom , but the show is well acted and hearing about the trials and tribulations of a major law is interesting . A great component is some fun firm investigators who constantly uncover , at the last minute , trial altering stuff , which again would not likely happen but after all this is TV not real life . The investigator creates a lot of screen interest as a young , tough , sexy , ethnic ( it is woven into the show ) woman who does n't share - little bit like the Lizbeth of dragon tattoo fame , but not as edgy .

Otherwise , it 's an obscene , narrowly focused , remote , spiritually uninvolving , and amateurishwaste of time .

Even Satan is portrayed as a cliche -- -an ambisexual hooded figure lurking in the background of several scenes . There is nothing new here except that all of the actors speak in Aramaic , which is distracting since you must read subtitles . The slow motion scenes are so self-conscious that the film becomes tedious to watch after awhile . Plus , there are historical inaccuracies contained within , like the fact that Romans did not nail spikes into Jesus ' hands but his wrists . Overall , this movie told me next-to-nothing about the man called Jesus of Nazareth . The only vaguely interesting part of the film was the music , which reminded of the excellent music from `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' composed by Peter Gabriel . ( The CD is titled `` Passion '' . ) In fact , if you want to watch a deeply moving , spiritual film , rent or buy `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' , which was a gritty , realistic interpretation of Jesus ' life , and contained a rare look at the human side of Jesus .

Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel `` Sadist '' Gibson , I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe , but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim . In short , it 's just a movie , not a particularly good one , with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what 's happening or to make you care . It looks terrific -- -Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness . But that 's about where the praise ends . The whole thing has a nasty tone ; in Mel 's version of the tale , anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery , and while I 'm not a believer myself , my guess is that 's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it . And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end , eyes a-blazin ' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack , I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to `` Braveheart Part II . '' Mel Gibson is a wretched director , and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously , for that gives them clout they do n't deserve . All he 's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie , complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire `` Friday the 13th '' series . This stuff was camp 30 years ago , and it 's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie 's complete lack of narrative grounding .

I thought using the ancient languages worked very well as did the look of the film , which featured some good filter effects ( the garden scenes ) and a drab color palette that evoked the past more than a bright one would have . I also liked Maia Morgenstern 's performance as Mary . She did an excellent job of portraying her mixed feelings of pride and pain . The sets of the city were good and there were some great landscape shots , especially from the mountains . I also thought the DTS soundtrack was very good.Those were n't enough to make this a good movie for me though . The beatings grew boring very quickly , which made the final half of the film very tedious for me . Mel Gibson mostly worked in caricatures , portraying the Roman soldiers as mindless brutes , the apostles as dim-witted cowards and the Jews as a rabid mob . James Caviezel did a good enough job playing an impossible role , but I did n't find someone covered in blood or woodenly quoting biblical passages particularly interesting . The scenes with the Satan character did n't work for me at all.There was also the problem that , if you were n't a Christian or familiar with the Christian mythology , this movie would have made no sense at all . I guess to Gibson this was n't a problem , since he was making this film for a specific audience . That audience made him a lot of money , so I suppose the choices he took worked for his pocketbook . That does not make this a great movie though . ( As far as the anti-Semitic question , I agree that this film qualified . The Jews suffered for centuries because of the `` Christ Killer '' label , and this movie echoed that belief . The Romans may have did the killing , but the Jews started the ball rolling , a fact Gibson hammered home repeatedly . Like father , like son . )"}, "29758": {"id": "29757", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Purely from the point of view of watching the movie it was amazing . The film costs here were amazingly well spent ( thats what the stars are for ) . To film a movie in Latin and Aramaic was brilliant and the sets and costumes were amazing . I think they could have saved about half the movie budget by having Jesus expend a human amount of blood but that 's ok -I realize it was necessary for Gibson to stay true to his fundamentalist Catholic views and strictly follow the stations of the cross in depicting the passion of Christ , even though there is no scriptural evidence for them . Having said this though it is important to point out what a horrible theology this movie presents . It is essentially the Anselmian view that Jesus was incarnated as the only sufficient sacrifice for our sins . As this movie presents it the only significant part of Jesus 's life is his death . It is this sort of blood-soaked religious ideology that says it is ok to kill people as a means of purification.Even as an atheist I can see that this is probably the most immoral of all ethical or religious doctrines . If you want a sound theology try Abelard or some of the Franciscan authors . In their writings the incarnation is the culmination of creation , an event that was planned from the beginning and NOT simply a reaction to `` people behaving badly '' . It represents the ultimate unification of God with His creation . The moral lesson comes not from the death of Jesus saving us from our sins . ( which mires human beings in eternal stupidity and does n't apparently cure us of sinfulness either ... so it is pretty much a wash ) The moral message needs to come from Jesus 's life ... take care of lepers , eat with tax collectors , help a prostitute get on her feet . Things get a little messed up but its not anything that can not be fixed by simply doing human things ."}, "29759": {"id": "29758", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I went to see this movie with a very open mind . Initially I was pleased with the cinematography and a little dissapointed with the somewhat contrived acting . The opening part of the movie is by far the most interesting and rich in terms of storyline and aesthetic beauty . This part of the movie is what nails it in the two-star range . What ensues , however , is probably the most deplorable attempt at sensory manipulation I have ever witnessed in my life.In a time when neoconservatism and counterfundamentalist-fundamentalism gripped the United States by the jowels this movie made a somewhat fortuitous entrance onto the world stage . As the bells of war sent young American soldiers out on the battlefield to defend Western hegemonic positions by way of `` the Almighty '' ( Bush 's great justification ) this movie danced across movie theater screens and attempted to do much more than tell the story of the life of Jesus . This movie turns Jesus into a symbol of cultural supremacy , a source of endless blood and suffering , and the American flag manifested in human flesh.As I sat and watched the hour and a half of torture unfold before my eyes I looked around the theater to see the faces of the families which so many claim to exemplify `` family values . '' What these children were watching was not a recreation of a myth aimed at reinforcing social solidarity , but a blatant piece of sensory manipulation which aimed at reinforcing xenophobia and notions of cultural superiority ."}, "29760": {"id": "29759", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "From a purely literary viewpoint , the trial and execution of Christ is one of the most powerful stories ever told . But in Mel Gibson 's new film `` The Passion of the Christ '' the fine drama is turned into coarse melodrama , as Gibson concentrates on flaying , blood-flying violence , the kind that appeals to the same people who flock to slasher movies . In fact , there may be those eagerly awaiting `` The Passion of the Christ 2 : Peter Gets His '' . Of course , there is violence in classic art . The Christian iconography of the Renaissance has canvas after canvas of whippings and nailings ; but those images are static and stylized , not the graphic naturalism of motion pictures . Speaking of which : Gibson , in promoting the movie , has emphasized how realistic his picture is , an oblique put-down of the Biblical epics of he Fifties and Sixties . Granted , many of those productions were artificial and sometimes not even very entertaining . ( At the risk of being hunted down by the NRA , I must admit I think `` Ben Hur '' is about 45 minutes too long . ) But the fact is `` The Passion of the Christ '' possesses the same artificialities as those old films -- presenting , for instance , a tall and handsome Jesus . There is a very strong likelihood that the historical Jesus looked more like Woody Allen than Jeffrey Hunter , but Gibson 's realism evidently did n't extend into casting . There are also some unfortunate lapses into what can kindly be called poetic license , including a sit-comish flashback where Mary is confused by a modern table constructed by her smart carpenter son . I 'm giving the picture two stars , one for the cast 's restrained ensemble acting and one for the superb photography of Caleb Deschanel .

I am a Christian and I thought that this movie really did n't have a point . I already knew that Jesus suffered before he died ; it did n't really affect me seeing it so graphically.What I mean is that if you see it from an atheist 's point of view , there is no point to the movie . The movie does n't tell us why Jesus was dying on a cross . Since the movie 's focus is on Jesus ' suffering , the message gets lost to non-believers . Personally , I was more affected by the Book of John than by this movie . Jesus had a lot of love for people in that movie and you could n't help but love Him . You do n't get that watching this movie.Now I would recommend this movie to people who really hate Christians and love seeing artwork of crucifix 's mutilated .

Quite frankly , I have no idea what people were looking at when they wholeheartedly claim this movie has no anti-jewish theme . Here are few I found quite objectionable because the biblical account of Jesus 's death has been twisted to place the blame of his cruxifiction solely on the Jews.1 ) Pontius Pilate tries to save Jesus and is portrayed as the good guy . He is not an objective and ruthless Roman governor , but a man who is interested in the truth of Jesus 's teachings . Three separate times , he tries to save Jesus 's life . First , when the Pharisees and the Jews bring battered Jesus to him , he actually complains that they beat him even though he is yet to be convicted of guilt . Then , refusing to condemn the man , he sends him to Herod . When Herod sends Jesus back ( again not finding him guilty ) , Pilate again tries to save Jesus by giving the Jews a choice to save him . The Jews , of course , chooses to save Barabas instead . Then the Pilate tries to save Jesus AGAIN by just beating and flogging Jesus , hoping it will quell the Jew 's anger , the Jews rejects Pilate pleading that Jesus had suffered enough punishment and should be set free . The Jews , and only the Jews , demands Jesus be cruxified.2 ) The high ranking Pharisees are seen beating Jesus with their bare hands . This scene was utterly ridiculous because it was an equivalent of a Pope beating a Jew with his bare hands ( which may have actually happened few hundred years back ) . Not only is this scene unbiblical , but historically unlikely . The Pharisees were very picky about who and what they touched . A blasphemer was considered unclean and untouchable , especially by pharisees , and beating Jesus with their bare hands broke their own strict rules.I found it disturbing that few twists of the story were all catered to blaming the Jews . In this , I found it even more disturbing than Jesus 's death itself .

And though I am not a Christian I respect the story of Jesus . But , this is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen portraying his life.99 % of the story , the dialog , and the violence is not an accurate portrayal . It 's not just that most of the story is made up or is n't accurate according to the Bible , but most of the dialog is made up too . Most of what is supposed to be from the Gospels is altered in some way to say something other that what scripture says.The violence in itself is another story . Though it is told that Jesus was tortured and suffered , the violence depicted in the movie just is n't realistic . It 's not just that 99 % of it is n't mentioned in the Bible , but there is no way on Earth that Jesus could have survived 20 minutes into the movie . If he had n't bled to death first , the fishhook type whips used on him would not only have ripped his flesh off his body , but gone in and ripped out his internal organs too . It 's just not realistic . No one could have survived that . Not even the Son of God.The portrayal of the Roman soldiers that beat Jesus was n't realistic either . I know that the Roman soldiers were cruel and could be sadistic but the way they are portrayed in this film is as much over the top as all the violence . The Bible mentions nothing of all this punishment . He was n't beaten and whipped and kicked around the way they showed as he carried his cross to Calvary . He fell three ( 3 ) times . And most of the portrayal that went on with him being nailed to the cross and set up is n't mentioned at all . Him being flipped over the way he was . Geez ! What this movie blatantly is , is an attempt to play on the emotions of those who believe so deeply in the story of Jesus . Period . It 's false propaganda and it plays its part well . You can tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they 'd ever seen . Do n't buy into it.Any Christian who is interested in watching a more accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus would be far better off watching Jesus of Nazareth . Or any non-Christian who 's just interested in learning about Jesus ' life . The real purpose of Jesus ' life is portrayed in Jesus of Nazareth , and done very well . His teachings .

I sat there and watched a man brutalized for two hours . Everyone around me was crying - it felt like we were all tuned in to the proceedings of a televised execution . I was a little confused by the time it was all over & as I was leaving the theater , I was even more so : I saw parents walking out with their children . Jesus Christ 's teachings were left in the wings , the significance of his life locked out of the script almost entirely . Hardly a first impression for young children . The ONLY things I found at all interesting about the PASSION OF THE CHRIST : the use of the authentic languages from the time period ( Latin & Aramaic ) and the actors bringing this movie to life . James Caviezel 's performance in Terrence Malick 's THE THIN RED LINE was simply mesmerizing , and he used a similar pallet of emotion for his performance here . I was raised a Roman Catholic - so viewing the Stations of the Cross was nothing new to me . To suggest this film version of that seasonal meditation is a `` masterwork '' - simply is absurd.So what WAS the point of this film , what were we to draw from its brutal imagery ? There was no inspiration in Mel Gibson 's film for me , no arc of understanding - only suffering and death . Which led me to consider their goal may have been to create a vivid emotional experience , intended to lift us out of numbness and inspire reflection on faith to get us through this life : televised warfare , beheadings on the internet , stories of sickness and shootings on the nightly news , etc . Perhaps , but I do n't think so . A fleeting , knee-jerk reaction with some tears shed on queue , and then those emotions are safely placed back on the shelf until the next time . Complicity and silence have always gone hand in hand : it 's easy to damn this world , condemn what we see as different from our own huddled beliefs ; allow selfishness and insincerity to decimate through clouds of frankincense and joyous hymns . Salvation ? Maybe.The infamous THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST , directed by Martin Scorsese , is a `` masterwork '' of filmmaking . The film not only inspires the heart , but also prods the mind . I could feel the breath of those images , allowing me to enter the world it created and truly feel something more than myself . It was not an epiphany ; it was a fresh view , it was an enlightened dream of another world , yet strangely our own . The film did n't plague the audience with blood and horrors ; it dramatizes the passion and relevance of the story . I 've come to understand and believe Jesus Christ to be among the greatest teachers this world has known , who suffered the tortures of the damned to inspire his vision of peace , determination for truth and humility in us all - ideals that have taken a back seat to robotic , indignant servitude to skewed `` moral '' interests.The LAST TEMPTATION was based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis - from which the filmmakers created a thoughtful , passionate re-examination of one of the greatest stories ever told . Mr. Scorsese , in his youth , had almost joined the priesthood ; but chose to explore and express his passion through the cinema . I saw no blasphemy in his images - only a powerful film exploring faith in ourselves and the world .

Unfortunately graphic violence alone is n't enough to give this movie the emotional impact that the subject deserves.The audience goes into this movie with knowledge of who and what Jesus is . For this reason Mel Gibson apparently thought that no character establishing scenes were necessary . All we learn from this movie is that Jesus was a guy who suffered a lot . In fact the ultra-violence actually made the crucifixion seem less agonizing to me . I could n't help but think that after losing about 3 gallons of blood ( based on the large pools left on the ground after he was flogged ) and the beatings he took about the head , that Jesus would have been too far gone by the time he was nailed to the cross to feel much pain . The few , brief scenes which did n't involve Jesus ' torture were mostly uninspired clips of events which occurred in the days prior to the crucifixion . These are scenes that those who have read the bible are all too familiar with , and the dull , monotone delivery by the actors does nothing to bring these scenes to life . The scenes of Satan and demonic children throughout the movie seem random and silly . How the writers and director could do so little with such a great story bewilders me.A far more moving movie is Jesus of Nazareth . The only objection I have heard about Jesus of Nazareth is that Jesus is played by a non-Jew with blue eyes . If you ca n't get over that then you will be depriving yourself of seeing a movie about Jesus that delivers far more insight into what a wise , charismatic , and loving entity Jesus was .

Of course , Bava knows that it 's all about the gore and , on that score at least , Demons really delivers . There 's enough gut munching , eye gouging and scalp tearing to satisfy even the most hardened gorehound , and the special effects ( courtesy of Argento regular Sergio Stivaletti ) are about as good as they come .

Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess , childlike in the appearance but strong willed , serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong . Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen 's `` Sweet and Lowdown '' , Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face , by her impressive and speaking eyes alone . It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length , but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel 's two main characters and their relationship . Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book . The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds . Hinds is a talented , intense actor but I ca n't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester 's character . Some his scenes in the film made me cringe . Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much . I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele . This manifestation was against the logic of his character.2.5/5"}, "29795": {"id": "29794", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This 1997 TV production is called `` Jane Eyre '' , but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront 's literary masterpiece . How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot , who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me , but they did . This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds they had two good actors , who even physically fit their roles well , but , alas , the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation . Samantha Morton - young , delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre , but does not play Jane Eyre . Her Jane is far too bold , even disrespectful at times , self-confident and self-satisfied , bossy and pert . Gone is the interesting duality of Jane 's character in the novel , her outward shyness , guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other . Morton 's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film . There is no subtlety in her performance , her Jane undergoes no change and no development . The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester . Believe it or not , but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully . Luckily Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds possesses some charisma , but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel . Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester 's character , his many contradicting facets , his moodiness , his inner struggle , his humour and his tenderness . The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times , but never the unrefined , snarling brute Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds makes him . Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester , and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles : Blanche , besides being blonde , is not in the least haughty enough , not to mention the fact that she is nice to Ad & egrave ; le , St. John is all smiles and kindness , and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up , probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones . Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront 's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience . The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter 's own banal lines . In either case they have lost all the charm , sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel . Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words : `` I know it may sound silly but ... . '' No , Mr. Hawley , if somebody sounds silly here , it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront ' ! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding , a scene , by the by , which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment . Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront 's Jane , the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront 's Rochester . What ? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him , bullying her , throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay ? Absolutely ridiculous ! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.This is the worst , but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous : the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook , Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic 's room to sniff at Mason 's wounds like a wild beast , Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.Equally lamentable is the filmmakers ' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies . Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot . Sentences like `` I feel that your passions are aroused '' are appropriate for `` Sex in the City '' , but not for a costume drama , let alone Jane Eyre . Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel , nor about portraying the novel 's era accurately . The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre . The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006 ."}, "29796": {"id": "29795", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Cirian Hinds and Samantha Morton are wonderful actors , but why did n't the screenwriters even glance at Charlotte Bronte 's book when they wrote this screenplay ?

Rochester screaming at Jane to leave Thornfield ? Jane and Rochester shopping downtown for wedding clothes and `` bumping into '' Blanche Ingram ? I do n't think so ! Not only did the screenwriters make up entirely new scenes , the dialogue in familiar scenes was often totally unrecognizable . I watch film adaptations to see my favorite characters and scenes fleshed out , not given a major overhaul.Two things they got right -- the age difference and chemistry between Rochester and Jane ( although Samantha Morton is too pretty . Come on ! She ca n't be pretty Harriet Smith in the A & E ; version of `` Emma '' and plain-Jane Eyre in this movie ! ) If you just like to watch good acting , you might like this .

The mini-series approach , however , allows ample time to study the characters in depth . In my 29 years , I recall not one , but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s . These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience . I wo n't judge which of the two is more definitive , having only read part of the book.The 1983 one , released to VHS/DVD , starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke . Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane , mistreated by her aunt Reed 's family and at Lowood school . This is the first hour of the series , and I was riveted . When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives , Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they 're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack . The series is excellent , almost to the point where I 'd call it treachery that it 's not available either on VHS or DVD . This was no minor production : in fact , it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.Dalton 's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious , almost a caricature . It 's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion . Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side , but balances sardonic wit with what 's been called a `` poetic imagination . '' Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane . You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role . His enthusiasm for the part is obvious . Clarke 's Jane is plain , and seeks independence , love and servitude , but it 's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from . It 's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking , although that may be . Cusack , an Irish actress , is irresistable in more ways than one . A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate , she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester , trading jabs , despite the difference in age and experience . Thus , in the early scenes , we get a good sense of Jane Eyre 's spiritedness ( even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood ) . The interaction of Dalton and Clarke , while fine , falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.Other things to note : the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK . The memorable theme music was the passionate `` Introduction and Allegro '' composed by one of Britain 's greatest , Sir Edward Elgar . My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft , the screenwriter , Robin Chapman , and to the cast : Megs Jenkins ( Mrs. Fairfax ) , Stephanie Beacham ( Blanche Ingram ) , Geoffrey Whitehead ( St. John Rivers ) , Susan Brodrick ( Mary Rivers ) , Caroline Harris ( Diana Rivers ) , Edward De Souza ( Richard Mason ) , and the rest.It 's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them . `` Jane Eyre '' is a classic novel . Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale . In fact , it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale , now . Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of `` Jane Eyre '' is not `` bad , '' and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.If you write to the powers-that-be , BBC America or BBC Worldwide , they 'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release . Go ahead and give it a try . Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.There is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found .

'' It looked intriguing and I aways wanted to see it.I was n't expecting `` Sansho the Bailiff , '' but at least a coherent storyline , believable characters , and events that could actually happen on some planet somewhere . Leon , played by Jean Reno , is supposedly the best hit man in New York , but he lives in a hovel while his handler , `` Tony '' played by Danny Aiello , claims to be holding his money for him . I fully expected some showdown between those two , as everything was telegraphing that Tony had no intention of ever letting Leon have his money except for doling out a little occasionally . It is also revealed that Leon is illiterate , drinks only milk , and is inordinately attached to a houseplant that he introduces as his `` only friend . '' Very well , a hit man is never going to be `` normal '' in any sense.Mathilda , played by Natalie Portman , asks Leon to allow her to be his apprentice after her family is murdered . Leon tries to cheer her up with a puppet , showing himself to be at heart a funny and playful fellow ( he also likes old musicals ) , but the relationship between the two is implausible . Leon agrees to take her on after she fires off a few rounds from his balcony and they have to suddenly leave the apartment , houseplant in hand , when any real hitman would have left her there as too great a risk . She soon comes in handy when she can fill out the registration card at the hotel they next stay in , but surely Leon has stayed in hotels in the past - how did he register before ? In a particularly amoral scene , Leon shows Mathilda how to shoot a rifle , firing what turns out to be a squib at a jogger . As someone who has owned and used firearms for many years , I can vouch for the fact that the normal course of instruction involves practicing at a range with paper targets , or in the desert with soda cans , before actually shooting at a live target . Hardly `` professional '' as Leon says about Mathilda 's balcony shooting spree.Stripping away the violence and lurid charm of a hitman , at bottom this is the story of a middle-aged curmudgeon forced to care for a waif , and developing an attachment against his better judgment .

An otherwise professional sociopath suddenly has a heart for a defenseless little girl ? But it does n't stop there . The relationship between Portman and Reno has strong sexual overtones which Besson intentionally emphasized by the mood of the dialogue and , most importantly , the very suggestive camera angles on Nataly Portman : the continuous angling of the camera on Portman 's hips , waste , crotch , and rear , makes this theme all too clear . The movie therefore presents pedophilic sentiments as normal and legitimate . Sorry , but a film on the lustful woes of a 40+ year old deranged assassin for a young 10-12 year old girl is n't worth a second look . The best performance in the film is by Gary Oldman who plays the corrupt police officer.Altogether a pretentious film that , due to its perverted theme , has absolutely no redeeming value .

In essence , stating that whatever a person does to waylay someone else 's groom is not only to be lauded , it 's to be applauded.But really , why bother ? Let 's take the groom at face value .

Her plan is to fake her kidnapping , and win Daddy 's affection upon her safe return . He 's involved in some rather shady business deals , and can afford the ransom payment of a million dollars . Emily binds herself with tape , and locks herself in the trunk of her BMW . While waiting to be recovered by the police , the car is stolen by Vincent ( Del Toro ) a professional car thief . From this somewhat interesting premise not a lot happens that is either funny , or exciting.The movie attempts , but does not succeed in creating a warm and romantic relationship between the two leads . Failing to achieve this , we are left with a barely average comedy adventure . Silverstone 's performance does have some charm , and though her character is a bit odd , she rarely becomes irritating . She is a fashion casualty though . Unfortunately the chemistry with Vincent just does n't develop as intended . Vincent mumbles and bumbles , and seems none too bright . You watch him wondering just how weird he actually is . He never offends , but neither does he charm you . It just seems his brain is working in a lower gear most of the time , except when it comes to the subject of serving jail time , which definitely gets his full attention.Chris Walken is Emily 's Uncle Ray , a slick operator with an inflated opinion of himself , who never lives up to the hype . He works for Emily 's father , and has a better relationship with her than her own father . He looks into the kidnapping on his own , providing yet another odd character to watch.The conclusion is as unsatisfying as the rest of the movie .

What 's missing is the canned laughter to give this movie some form of legitimacy and classification as to what the producer had in mind when he dished this up to the public.Yes , every respectable critic has alluded to the spraying of hundreds of rounds machinegun fire inside a pressurised cabin of a 747 , but what we have here is a President who 's a master of armed and unarmed combat ; an Avionics Engineer - a man adept at doing anything in a crisis situation .

The scenes in the war room with the false sentiments of angst , anticipation , anxiety and , finally , overwhelming relief and joy ... ... it was cringingly awful.Somehow , I ca n't help but think , that those viewers who raved about this movie spend their vacation in the Grand Canyon searching for conclusive proof that the coyote is still chasing after the Roadrunner ."}, "29845": {"id": "29844", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "When Russian terrorists posing as a news crew hijack Air Force One , the President himself is forced to save the day .

In the hands of a savvy writer/director like Phil Noyce or Rod Lurie or Michael Mann , this could have been that rarest of beasts - an action-thriller with something to say . Unfortunately , with Wolfgang Petersen at the helm it plays more like an episode of `` Thunderbirds '' . The A-list cast is squandered : Gary Oldman plays another ridiculous villain ; Glenn Close unfortunately reprises her comedic role from `` Mars Attacks ! '' Only Ford is truly convincing . He 's particularly well-cast as President Jim Marshall , because the role requires precisely what Ford can always be relied on to give , in every guise from Jack Ryan to Richard Kimble to Indiana Jones : the slightly fearful , slightly bumbling heroics of an ordinary guy forced to do extraordinary things . He 's great , and the scenes in which he 's fighting for his life in the cargo hold are the movie 's best moments , not least because Petersen 's particular talent seems to be for staging tense action sequences in confined settings . But it 's not enough . The whole picture is ultimately undone by its dogged insistence on taking itself seriously . Andrew W. Marlowe 's script is utterly devoid of humour and contains some memorable clangers : `` I 'm countin ' on you , red white and blue ... '' , and the utterly cringe-worthy , `` GET OFF MY PLANE ! '' . Jerry Goldsmith 's insufferably chipper score , which seems specifically crafted to induce some kind of patriotic swoon , obliterates most of the realism from any scene , and what remains is shot down by the ludicrously inept special effects . One is almost tempted to read film this as Wolfgang Petersen 's tongue-in-cheek Hollywood calling card . `` You want me , a German , to demonstrate my allegiance by making patriotic Hollywood crap ? Sure , I can do that . Just watch me . '' He certainly knows his market .

Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles `` A Hard Days Night '' , the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized . A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members ca n't save the film from its own bad dialogue , poor choreography and painful lip-syncing . Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth ( Alan Cumming ) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project , a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls : Ginger ( Geri Halliwell ) , Baby ( Emma Bunton ) , Posh ( Victoria Beckham ) , Sporty ( Melanie Chisholm ) and Scary ( Melanie Brown ) . While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice , the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England . Meanwhile , their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief ( Roger Moore ) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers , or a caress of his squealing bovine . And if that is n't enough , a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines . To top it all off , a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives , which as it turns out , is basically the very movie we 're watching.Since the story of the film is largely pointless , and little else really holds attention spans , it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that do n't quite add up . For starters , the girls drive around in the Spice Bus , a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior . So impossibly large in fact , that it does n't even pretend to make sense . Workout equipment , couches , beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus , in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus . And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows , even though the realism has long since been abandoned.While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions , physiques and attitudes , those characteristics do n't translate over to their personalities . Either they were all scripted to be ditzy , or they 're just naturally that way . Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios , most of which are intended as comedy relief , despite the blatant absence of humor . Similarly , the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations , and they 're choreographed with little self-respect , and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing . Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life , and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles , an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.With brief appearances by Elton John , Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits , a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure , and countless attempts at failed humor , Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group . And even entertaining those fans is debatable .

Jimmy is a vaudevillian who gets shot in the throat in WWI and must manage the career of his singer wife . He also gets involved with the mob thanks to prohibition . His son , Benny , is a piano genius who is killed is WWII . Benny 's son is the misfit Tony , who we follow from the Beat generation to a drug induced 1970 's . Tony 's one night stand product , Pete , continues the drug trade , but can belt out one mean tune in the punk rock late 1970's.Bakshi 's animation still consists of tracing live action onto film as animated subjects . This makes for some really jerky scenes , although not on the headache inducing level of his earlier work . There are a few places where the work is downright interesting , like Tony 's acid trip and eventual fall from a stage , and Pete 's dancelike movements as he delivers his drugs to his customers.Bakshi 's biggest mistake is using well known songs in the soundtrack , and attributing them to cartoon characters . Pete writes `` Night Moves . '' Benny comes up with `` As Time Goes By '' after stealing the riff from a hobo . Tony wrote `` Somebody to Love . '' I found this angle of the film irritating . It is not like no one has ever heard of these songs , and would be fooled . It just seems as if the film makers were too lazy to come up with their own material , and the songwriters and publishing houses were too eager to sell their stuff for a quick buck . Since the entire film consists of this one family coming up with all the great songs of the last eighty years , toss any suspense out the window as to what each generation is going to accomplish.Bakshi is also obsessed with the illegal drug culture in the final half of the film . What is this , `` Panic in Needle Park '' ? Watching cartoon characters shooting heroin is bizarre , but pointless . I ask the same question I ask of some of Bakshi 's other work , specifically `` Hey Good Lookin ' , '' why did he animate this ? Why did n't he shoot this with live actors ? The animation , while interesting , is completely unwarranted.In the end , `` American Pop '' is as homogenized and half baked as much of the music coming out today . Then again , I 'd rather watch Britney Spears cavort in low riding jeans than sit through this music mondo mockumentary again . `` American Pop '' has left the building , do n't bring it back next year.This is animated , but rated ( R ) for physical violence , strong gun violence , gore , profanity , brief female nudity , sexual references , strong drug abuse , and strong drug references ."}, "29875": {"id": "29874", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "The animation is good , especially considering when it was made , but & quot ; American Pop & quot ; is never quite successful .

And his dismissal of punk and rush to embrace the bland beardo post-hippie commercial rock of Bob Seger and Heart betrays Bakshi 's age , and maybe a lack of good taste as well . It comes off a bit old-fogeyish.Like a lot of Bakshi 's work , this has to be taken as it is , and the viewer has to bear in mind when and how it was made . Computer animation was in its infancy , and animation was at a low point in the United States , so the fact that this was made and distributed in mainstream theaters at all was a minor miracle at the time.In short , the musical spots provide the bright moments , but the plot is labored and the characters , particularly the ridiculous & quot ; rock star & quot ; he invents at the end of the film , are unconvincing .

In the film Richard Gere plays a tough New York cop with a drinking habit , an ex-wife , and a bad rep . So what happens to him ? Well his good natured partner ( you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose ) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down . So the film turns into the rouge cop on the revenge trail story . This will bring him to New Oreans ( that whole & quot ; fish-out-of-water & quot ; thing ) , and to Kim Basinger . Along the way Gere will encounter lots of bad guys , bullets , cops who do n't like him , swamps , crawfish , and cajons ( sp ? ) all to a hip 80 's soundtrack.This film was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Kim Basinger together and to it 's credit it is better than there second film , Final Analysis . However there really is n't much going on here . The plot was as predictable as traffic at five o'clock . Neither Gere nor Basinger is very good which is Richard Pearce 's ( the director ) fault because they fall in and out of their accents . I have to say though there is something about Richard Gere that even in his weaker films , like this one , he is still fun to watch . The same can be said for Basinger who is always delightful on the eyes even when she is hard on the ears.This film has it 's momments , but they are pretty sparse .

A sci-fi movie ( or rather direct to video release ) comes along with a very compelling premise and even an interesting plot , but in the end fails to meet the expectations set by what makes the idea so great in the first place . I watch Screamers and I see a fascinating idea from the events unfolding in the movie . However by the time the movie ends I have to ask myself , `` there has to be a way to do this better ... much better . '' This is pretty much where Screamers sits . Good stuff mired in not so good stuff.What 's good about Screamers ? It 's based on the short story , Second Variety by Philip K Dick , which itself has been named a very influencial and critically acclaimed writing . So the background story is this : A corporation and their previous employees wage war on each other on a planet based on disputes over how to reclaim some valuable resources . The ex-workers , who named themselves The Alliance , created intuative robots to help in the fights . Eventually the robots end up wiping out both sides until there is hardly anybody left . Not a bad start . The film is essentially about a group of Alliance soldiers making their way to a company outpost to hammer out a truce , but those pesky robots ( called Screamers ) have their own plans . Most of the major plot points from that premise are rock solid on paper , and would make for some really cool scenes . However ... ... on to the bad about Screamers . As good an idea as the plot if you ca n't take the viewer there and get them to really absorb what 's going on then your film will fall flat . This is what happens . We get to a rather interesting and major plot twist that wraps up pretty much what the movie is about , but you would n't know it by seeing those scenes . It just moves with the kind of pacing you would expect from a scene with little importance to the plot . That how most of the scenes feel . Just a little exposition or action that does n't feel tied to the story . Characters come up as one dimensional with rather pointless traits that do n't lead anywhere . Some twists seem to come out to build suspense but really feel like they were dropped into the story with very little to allow them to make any sense . So a great idea is held back by poor planning in both the script and direction.As far as the technical side of the film is concerned I really have little to complain about considering this is likely a low budget release . The sets range from impressive to quite believeable . The post apocalyptic look is consistent . The special effects are serviceable too . I liked the stop motion animation work they used and was impressed by how well it blended with the rest of the film . The violence end of the special efffects work pretty well without getting into the gory side of things . Acting ... well I ca n't complain . Good actors do good and some actors overact , but sometimes I have to defer that to how the director leads them.The DVD is pretty bare bones with just a movie trailer and language options as your extras . The picture was clean , but I have an issue with the 5.1 dolby digial audio . It just seems the dialog took a major back seat to the surround audio effects and explosions . More than once I had to turn up the volume just to hear the mumblings of the actors only to turn it down again because some robot is screaming ( guess why the movie is titled such ? ) or some other audio queue comes blaring out much louder than normal . As low a rating I give to this film I still think die hard sci-fi fans should at least give it a rental so they can at least ponder what the movie was trying to accomplish . The rest you may want to go ahead and give this one a pass . It 's not scary or gory enough for horror and suspense fans . It 's not intense enough for action junkies ."}, "29880": {"id": "29879", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "First off , Robert DeNiro as the monster .

Frankenstien 's shock that she 's not happy to be back -- burnt up , cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest -- was supposed to be touching but I laughed .

That 's OK when you do it convincingly ( hardly ever in real life do I hear someone yell `` YOU SHALL NOT PASS ! ! ! ! '' but in a fantasy film , it works ) . When you do it without conviction or use it as a lame attempt to immitate 1940 's film noir , it just sounds stupid.Plot : Plot holes you can drive a truck through abound in this film . Biggest and most obvious is `` why go to all the bother of tricking someone into doing something when you could have just stuck a gun in his back and forced him to do it ? '' Just about every element of this ridiculous ruse has the same problem : They all rely on `` chance '' occurances that could n't reasonably be arranged to happen . From step one ( the sea plane landing ) to the final act ( the pseudo-japanese tourists being on exactly the right water taxi out of hundreds of others ) , the audience is asked to believe that these staged coincidences are possible . They 're not , and so the film becomes unconvincing from start to finish.Setting : Is it 1940 's film noir ? Is it the 90 's ? Is this some sort of Jimmy Buffet island theme mystery gone sour ? Hard to tell . Oddly enough , it almost appears intentionally so . The potential gains from the formula are written on a blackboard but not shown to the audience . Phones look modern ( for the 1990 's ) , but you still have secretaries dialing for execs . I 'm not sure when `` get me [ name here ] on the phone , Dolores '' went out of style , but it was definitely before the 90's.Costuming : so/so . No real issues here , other than it 's a little ambiguous.Cinematography : My biggest beef . If you 're going to do a 1940 's film noir knock-off , film it in grainy B & W ; or at least work the camera angles better . L.A. Story et alia do a much better job of evoking the period and the genre . There were a few half-hearted attempts ( the focus on the sunshine bakery bag , for example ) , but none accomplished much more than making me wonder why they bothered.Misc : - The use of the carousel was an obvious nod to The Sting . Unfortunately , this movie had none of the campy believability of that classic.- The female lead was a bad pick . Steve Martin made a decent attempt to carry the bad dialogue , but she just cranked out each monotone wooden line one after the other as if people anywhere or anywhen had actually spoken in that fashion . It would be hard for one actress to ruin a film , but she gives it an old college try.- The lead character makes a big deal over the fact that his formula is locked in a safe- but then leaves it scribbled on a blackboard covered only with a curtain ."}, "29884": {"id": "29883", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "There are some enjoyable scenes .

At the reunion she faints , then wakes up back in time . She is once again in high school . She is given a chance to do it all over again.The foundation of this movie was not odd , as it 's been the theme of many sci fi and fantasy films past and present .

It 's not inconceivable that a man who has been brutally imprisoned for 19 years would emerge a hardened and angry man . But it 's not the portrayal you get in the book , and it erodes the sympathy you have for him in the movie . Strike a priest ? Hit Cossette ? ! ? Not a chance .

( If you 're looking for a relatively middle of the road view , see No Man 's Land . ) But that is none of my concern here.I understand the movie was made on a budget ( as seems clear from the director 's commentary ) , but that is no excuse for its many shortcomings.First , the good stuff.It looks great . Great location , nice colours , and it sounds good to boot . Good production.The action/fight scenes are very well done , not overdone in the ever so popular action movie style , but they do n't look cheap and cheesy , just natural and realistic . Violence is well measured , purposeful ( within the movie and plot ) and has realistic results and consequences.Camera work is good too , the close ups from Quaid 's PoV work especially well . It 's almost like being there : ) Finally , before I forget , the meat of the plot and Quaid 's character are quite good.But could have been worked better.The opening scenes ( developed as almost a separate sub-movie ) introduce us to Quaid 's character . Then he 's off to Foreign Legion boot camp , and does a couple of missions , which presumably make him a hardened veteran . Really , they 're just confusing . Too short to matter and to absorb . Suddenly we 're in Bosnia looking through a sniper 's scope . Aside from the opening scenes , we 're left to assume Quaid 's a tortured , restless , numb soul . He must be , because the director says so . Listening to the director 's commentary track , you have to laugh out loud at times , because what he 's describing and what you 're seeing are almost total opposites . And I do n't think it 's a language barrier.The director also keeps blaming the 'financiers ' for many things . They wanted this , and that , did n't like this , etc , etc . Please ... The dialogue is very stiff , very forced and unnatural . Good thing the kid gets off-screen early ; he 's your typical Hollywood portrayal of a child , asking all these insightful adult questions , like 'is god in bad people too ? ' Adults do n't fare much better , delivering disjoint , wooden lines every couple of minutes . And what 's with those voices ? Sure is a lot of grunting going around . Goran is just about the only guy with any soul showing in the movie.That 's my biggest beef here . It 's almost painful to sit through the thing sometimes , you just got ta cringe and bear it for a few more minutes.Which brings me to the last point .

Some reviewer said that the slight glimmer of hope with the baby was the only thing that made it worthwhile . Personally , I thought the movie took the easy way out several times , the major one being the baby plot . Just a little too wishy-washy Hollywoody happy ending style . There are a couple of scenes that will make your average American movie goer wince and oooh , and aww ( out of social responsibility mostly ) , but nothing a seasoned war movie veteran has n't seen before in more brutal detail.Really , if the director intended for us to see Quaid 's stuggle with himself , his humanity , his search for hope , it should have been more subtle , using plot points like the baby as mere devices , means to an end , not bludgeon viewers over the head to make sure they do n't miss the obvious . And the director clearly indicates , time and time again , that this is a character study . Well , if it is , how come there 's so little character ? 2/5 .

Unfortunately , this film is everything that the Japanese films are not.Produced in the middle of a series of intentionally-made `` blockbuster '' movies ( following such fine fare as Independence Day and anticpating the awful Armageddon and Wild Wild West ) , this movie intentionally tries to go in too many directions to succeed -- is it a campy monster movie of the 60 's presenting ecological warnings , or perhaps an action/science thriller a la Jurassic Park , or even a special effects extravaganza ? Godzilla never seems to make up its mind.The action sequences fail to thrill as they come across as contrived and artificial , many looking to be made for prompt conversion to video games . The acting , too , leaves much to be desired ; Godzilla will stand always as a blemish on Matthew Broderick 's career .

'' ... but apparently helicopters can only fly horizontally and get run down by a hungry monster.I would like to recommend this film for a `` bad movie night '' or for inclusion on any future episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but then I 'd be indirectly contributing to the film 's financial gains .

The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy attempts to stop him destroying much of downtown Los Angeles in the process.While the technical aspects of the film -- -especially the flying scenes and the BlueThunder itself are generally cool and well done and the acting is about as good as it can be , the film is grounded by the basic foolishness of its premises which eventually leaves the film just sitting on the tarmac as the passengers wait impatiently to get off.The idea that it is a bad thing to have a super helicopter for use against terrorists and rioters was stupid then and , after the Rodney Riots , the Crown Heights pogrom and 9/11 , is exactly what one would think it is now . Obviously it would be VERY BAD that the Blue Thunder existed ... ... ... ..for terrorists , rioters ... ..and their allies and supporters . For everyone else , the Blue Thunder would be a great and wonderful thing.The film has the usual commie prop smears . The main villain Macolm MacDowall is the inexplicably English -- and so vaguely homosexual -- - Nordic looking Vietnam Vet who used to enjoy tossing noble Communist officers from his helicopter in Vietnam though he somehow manages not to take drugs , drink nor does he rape anyone but that is about it . Schreider is given Candy Clark to show that he is a good virile heterosexual like all good liberals are . Certainly Clarke -- the only female in the cast save briefly a Black Woman who is nearly raped by the agents of the Right Wing Wing Conspiracy -- serves no other purpose and , in fact , one is still unsure whether she is supposed to be Scheider 's wife or girlfriend . Scheider is also shown having a Hispanic friend . His token Black friend being out of town that week.The film makes a big whoha over how the Blue Thunder is somehow this great big threat to civil liberties and Democracy and yet takes great glee in violating those same civil liberties of McDowall and crew upon the apparent theory that Communist , liberals and minorities have Civil Right but people they do not like do not.The script -- -flawed in many ways from lack of plot resolutions to underdelveloped characters -- - makes the major and tension deflating mistake of having Scheider steal the Blue Thunder and having the villains try and stop him with inferior weaponry . The thing is practically a flying tank and yet the big dog fight at the end is between Scheider in his unstoppable flying fortress and McDowell in this little helicopter put put.What ANY OTHER normal filmaker would have done would to have dropped the whole silly ass vast ring wing conspiracy plot and have the helicopter stolen by either a Moslem Terrorist or a Communist agent who plan to do something bad with it and then send Scheider up in the little helicopter put put to try and stop it . That is called suspense . That is called putting the hero up against tremendous odds.But no . We had to have our Commie Prop . Reagan was in office and there were things more important than such luxuries like artistic integrity or even competent film making.This was Warren Oates last film . He died soon afterwards . Pity this was his last film.Blue Thunder is merely just a little gas.Take an alka seltzer.One wonders if the Blue Thunder is still futuristic or has the present caught up to the Sci Fic elements ? ? If so , one DOES hope though that the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy rebuilt the Blue Thunder and sent it to Iraq , Afghanistan and the Philipines to aid a good number of Moslem Barbarians to attain their Islamic paradise ."}, "29931": {"id": "29930", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This is one of the most average horror movies I 've ever seen .

So it lends itself to logic that if you believe in the Candyman , you know what saying his name 5 times will bring ; Sid 's guess is that you just take a pass on chanting `` Candyman '' and keep living a normal life . But not our main character . Nope , she risks her life and those around her to write an awesome thesis on urban legends . Why could n't this girl just do some research to write her thesis ? That 's the one question that can unravel this ridiculous plot.Sid could not find one good thing about this movie . It was plodding , boring , shallow and pedantic .

It has a great premise with lots of promise ; a great cast that could and should deliver strong performances and yet it comes across overly campy and boring and ultimately forgettable . I was initially excited to see this film since I adore everything Russell Crowe ( how many times have I uttered those words this past week ) but when I saw this film a few years back I cringed at the thought that he starred in this drivel . I shrugged it off as a minor misstep in an impressive career and moved on . A few weeks back though my wife happened to rent this thinking I 'd be excited to watch it . Having just watched the Crowe masterpiece ` 3:10 to Yuma ' and salivating over every frame I decided that maybe I 'd enjoy this movie now . Well , my opinion has n't changed. ` The Quick and the Dead ' drops us in the dusty town of Redemption ( such a clich & eacute ; western name ) and introduces us to its rowdy inhabitance . The town is ruled with an iron fist by tyrant John Herod who seems to thrive on the spilled blood of others . He has butted heads with reformed Cort , a man of God who has left his criminal ways of the past behind him . Herod refuses to let him forget the man he once was and tries to pressure him into signing up for his ` Quick Draw ' contest . Cort refuses and thus makes himself Herod 's prisoner . Then in walks Ellen , a young woman apparently scorned who has a vendetta against the evil Herod . She enters his contest in order to have her revenge by taking his life.Like I said , the premise has promise , but it all falls terribly flat . The biggest problem I have is the atrocity that is Sharon Stone . I 'll never understand this woman 's draw on the public . Her acting chops is the farthest thing from decent ; in fact she 's so horrid that the mere fact I ` LOVE ' her performance in ` Casino ' almost repulses me . She does n't understand Ellen in the slightest and plays her so sullen and so dull that I wish they had cast someone slightly talented for the role . The only good thing I can say about Stone is that she hand picked Crowe for his role here ; so at least she notices real talent despite her lack of it . DiCaprio is another drawback . I love what this kid became but this performance is too hammy for me to appreciate . Russell Crowe and Gene Hackman are the only redeeming factors to this film when it comes to acting . Crowe 's performance , while not his finest , is strong and polished and Hackman is always top-notch when playing the villain . Sadly , they alone ca n't save this mess.I like the point I heard one reviewer make in regards to this film ; that it 's a Sam Raimi film and so it must be a cartoon . He then proceeded to make that a good thing but I ca n't do that . It is a cartoon but I do n't think that was purposeful and that what makes it so horrific . When Stone tries to act hard , hurt or suffering she looks tired , bored and confused . Raimi tries to make something dramatic and meaningful and fails miserably . The ending was so corny and contrived that I could n't stop rolling my eyes , even after they started aching and begging for mercy . In the end I went with two stars over the more appropriate on for the fact that both Crowe and Hackman at least deserve a star a piece for trying desperately to salvage this burning heap of trash ."}, "29939": {"id": "29938", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I do not own this movie on bluray or DVD but I do have it on VHS .

I really , really attempted to like this movie , mostly because of the numerical ratings it has received here and on imdb ( and I do n't read the written reviews beforehand ) .The beginning really made me believe I was going to be awed : the great 1930s landscape , a film noir look , interesting-looking set designs , and ( to top it all off ) the GREAT Armin Mueller-Stahl !

The story merely relied on 1/3rds of the original story , with the characters changing their original literary roles that gave the story so much depth . The questions of & # 34 ; what is real & # 34 ; in the original story was not the cynical plot of this adaptation . The special effects were the equivalent to those of a rock concert , with laser lights in fog , glowing eyes , and ( straight from television 's & # 34 ; Stargate SG-1 & # 34 ; - but even less graphic ) wormholes ! I do n't know what the budget was for this movie , but I guarantee that Fassbinder 's wonderful adaptation was even less than the budget for this movie.The story follows Douglas Hall and his attempt to find the killer of Fuller , his partner . Dennis Haysbert plays , with little depth , a detective ( who has an entirely different role in the story ) attempting to find the murderer . Vincent d'Onofrio looks and acts like a slightly-overweight John Malkovich , playing the most interesting character , the Simulacron-3 technician , but , with how interesting the other characters were , this really is n't saying much .

But do n't worry ; to let you know what era it is they show the totally irrelevant ( to this film ) King assassination . Finally a note on the acting . The easiest thing in the world is to act like someone who 's stupid or crazy . They act crazy pretty well , acting as if stupidity were a virtue . For a much better true story showing the abuse of psychiatry see the film , Francis , starring Jessica Lange ."}, "29960": {"id": "29959", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Winona Ryder is far from my favorite actress . I can praise her work in films like Beetle Juice , Lucas and Edward Scissorhands , but I must utterly dismiss her for lackluster performances in films like Age of Innocence and Aliens 4 . In Girl Interrupted Ryder is quite good , but the film is a mixed bag that is dominated by an almost over-the-top , though affecting performance by Angelie Jolie ( as Lisa ) . Her performance is the type of take no prisoners work which sometimes is richly rewarded by the Oscar folks ( and of course , was ) . It 's also the reason to keep watching this film which offers nothing particularly new , but might connect and offer some solace to those who have ever felt alienated by not playing by someone else 's idea of the rules.The film features folks in supporting roles like Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave who are n't given much to do and therefore act like they are picking up a check for a t.v . movie of the week.I do n't fault them so much for that , because much of Girl Interrupted feels very much like a t.v . movie of the week or an Afterschool Special . It plays sometimes like a softer , gentler , One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.What I really fault the film for is in it 's numerous continuity errors . I mean glaringly obvious ones that make me wonder if anyone other than Ryder cared as deeply for this project as we 've been led to believe . Supposedly ( and I 've no reason to disbelieve it ) Ryder worked for nearly 7 years to hold onto this project and see that it was brought it to the screen with the care and reverence she felt it deserved . To insure this , she became one of the producers of the project and probably partially financed the rights to the book and most likely sacrificed her normal star salary.The book is written as a string of vignettes , and author Susanna Kayson has a prose voice for capturing small personal details . The vignettes and thoughts add up to make a very affecting book , but the book does n't have a strong narrative . To make a film of the book a more conventional narrative was needed . This narrative could have sharply skewered psychiatry , or become a feminist One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , creating some evil psychiatrist or Nurse Ratchet character.To it 's credit the film does n't do this . It stays truer to the source material than that . When some rich parents ca n't communicate with their children , they sometimes let psychiatric hospitals do their work for them . And that 's essentially the story that is told here.The hospital is not a Snake Pit kind of place . But it is a cold , and sometimes heartless institution . The movie makes the point that one of the main reasons Kaysen was committed to McLean was her possible promiscuity , and her depression which ended with a half hearted suicide attempt involving aspirin and vodka . Men have rarely been considered mentally disturbed for their promiscuity .The film also to its credit does n't romanticize insanity either . We meet characters who are troubled without thinking they are very ` cool ' or destined to be artistic outcasts . Yet we do n't have anyone who warrants our sympathy in terms of a central character . After all , Kaysen admitted herself to the institution , and its clear she was smart enough to pretty quickly play the game well enough to get herself released if she decided it was better dealing with the turbulent 1960 's on the outside , then the cold instutionalism of a high class mental institution . And Ryder 's performances is quiet and even . She let 's Jolie as Lisa and some of the other characters over-emote around her . That 's to her credit on the one hand , but it does n't help us as audience members to care all that much about her.As the central figure of film , rather than as the narrator of the book , Kaysen is who we are most focused on . And she is the least troubled of nearly anyone we meet . We know she 's in pretty good shape and in fact becomes a surrogate big sister to some of the other in-mates in the institution . So where 's the suspenseful conflict ? We know there is n't a really big problem , and we know she is n't in any great danger . Some of the other characters clearly have some major issues , but we do n't get to know or care very much about them.And then there are the continuity errors to really bother those who are paying attention . There are a couple of scenes where you 'll see Ryder as Kaysen lighting a cigarette and smoking and then a few moments later , lighting another cigarette . She 's rarely without a cigarette but to show her constantly lighting up cigarettes is pretty ridiculous , particularly since in one case she 's in the back of a cab , and if she were rapidly chain-smoking , the cab would be thick with smoke , which it isn't.Another one that really bothered me , was later in the film , ( and so as not spoil anything I wo n't go into great details about what else is going in ) , we learn Angelina Jolie as the sociopath Lisa really despises cats . A cat that follows Ryder out for a walk , but when she returns , the cat is inside the apartment where Lisa ( Jolie ) is . Lisa would n't have let the cat back in-she hates cats.. it 's a mistake and mistakes happen but this film is full of continuity errors , which shows a real sloppiness on the director , and editors part.I could n't help but think of times of Jack Arnold 's cult campy classic Switchblade Sisters when Angeline Jolie as Lisa was on screen . She 's chewing the scenery in a barely disguised variation on a bad girl from reform school type of performaance which would have been right at home in a 50 's juvie film or a 70 's woman in prison film.And I could n't help thinking that although parts of Girl Interrupted are well done , and well acted , I would have much rather been watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest or even Switchblade Sisters , then this film.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

I guess I can see why Jolie won the Oscar -- her role was showy and flashy -- but there is now no doubt in my mind that Chloe Sevigny was robbed . As for the film itself , it obviously strives to be a female version of & quot ; One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest & quot ; but the film never attains the impact of the classic because it 's muddled and directionless . And the dialogue is clunky to boot . This is the type of movie where characters are constructed by giving them situations in which they have to argue and throw out descriptive accusations/criticisms at one another . There are a number of moments when the film becomes profound -- such as the examination of how certain actions from boys are perceived as rebellious but the same actions from a girl would be considered insane . I also liked Vanessa Redgrave 's monologue about the fine line between sanity and insanity -- that insanity is really just the overindulgence of one 's own preoccupations . But ironically , that point only serves to weaken the movie as it raises the question of how people so preoccupied with themselves can make such incisive observations about one another ."}, "29964": {"id": "29963", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "In a movie that is 127 minutes long , we should be given a clear explanation of why Winona Ryder 's character belongs in a mental hospital . Instead , we 're thrown into the middle of everything , when her parents are considering the option of admitting her into the insane asylum.The predictability of & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; does n't help itself at all . Of course , she does n't think that she belongs in a ward , even though she admitted to her doctor that she swallowed an entire carton of aspirin , and that was before she drank a bottle of vodka , all because she had a headache . All movies in this category ( and believe me , there are more than you would think ) have the inmate going through a period of denial leading up to an eventual feeling of belonging.The character development behind almost everyone in & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; ended up being another very weak link , and , in a very dark drama that is based on a true story , this is a critical element that just is n't up to par , and that really hurts it . Like I said earlier , we need to know why Winona Ryder 's character is going through this stage of depression , and we need to know what part of the phase is so unbearable that she ca n't handle it on her own . I remember the word & quot ; blue & quot ; being used when her feelings were being described , and that word falls short of description that would constitute someone needing to go to a mental institution . In a big world like this , there are people that are n't able to cope with certain things all by themselves , and that is what her character is supposed to evoke . In reality , I know of two people who have been through experiences in life that were too difficult to be dealt with alone , and , when the topic of the drama that they are going through comes up , the word & quot ; blue & quot ; would n't be enough to describe what they were going through . She is playing a 17-18 year old ( even though she was 28 during the filming ) in 1967 who is dealing with the problems that everyone faces at that age . Everyone faces those problems , and everyone deals with them . It 's a little thing called the real world , and , if her character ca n't adjust to it , then I , as the viewer , do n't care whether or not she gets over her problem or not , because it all comes off as a bunch of complaining.Acting was n't good either . Angelina Jolie was supposed to appear to be insane , but her character was really just an idiot , which is completely different from insanity . Jack Nicholson in & quot ; The Shining & quot ; is insanity ; Angelina Jolie in & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; is an idiot . At one point in the movie , an inmate told someone to call her a cab , and he called her cab , as it were a name , and she went bizerk , laughing . Insane ? No . Idiotic ? Very.So , overall , I have enough real problems and complaints now , and I do n't need to hear the petty , superficial ones that are poorly portrayed in this movie . If I were anything like anyone in this movie , then I would go crazy every time I had the most subtle , unthreatening problem . Stay away from this movie . It is boring , annoying and without any strength of conviction ."}, "29965": {"id": "29964", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "If you 're familiar , even in passing , with Christopher 's Hampton 's stage play Les Liaisons Dangereuses ( based on the 18th century novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos ) or its subsequent ( and very popular ) film incarnation , Dangerous Liaisons starring the insanely brilliant Glenn Close as the black hearted Marquise de Merteuil and , in my opinion , the miscast John Malkovich as the lascivious and callous bon-vivant , Vicomte de Valmont than you can easily forego seeing this rather inept and not surprisingly insipid modernization and blithely go about your business . Something has definitely been lost in translation and it extends far beyond period costumes and Bach 's keyboard concertos . Though a teenager 's ability to descend the depths of cruelty is well known and documented , rarely is it of the sophisticated and viciously calculated variety , such as is the case here . Furthermore , we 're not dealing with pawns that live within the sheltered environs and cloistered walls of 18th century France , but rather modern adolescents living rather privileged existences in one of the world 's most modern and sophisticated cities , New York . They 're hardly as gullible as pious 15 year old girls reared in convents . Pulling the wool over their collective eyes is going to take considerable effort not to mention near Machiavellian craftiness . In this retelling , both the plot and characters reek of artifice and you do n't know whether to laugh or take the film seriously . It has nothing to do with the performances but rather with everything leading up to them , primarily a script that aches to be modern , yet is often times burdened with some stilted and archaic dialogue as if it 's trying to hearken back to and somehow channel its original source . I mean , how many 16 year olds nowadays do you know of that write actual letters ? I do n't mean emails or text messages , I mean physical letters ? In short , the film , more often than not , suffers from an identity crisis . The actors were more than decent and they did their best considering the material they were given and the soundtrack is n't at all bad , either . In closing , the movie is hardly dreadful and it can be rather entertaining but , again , if you 're familiar with the 1988 Stephen Frears ' film or to a lesser extent Milos Forman 's Valmont of a few years later , you 'll find yourself squinting through Cruel Intentions , vainly and understandably searching for remnants of either film and their respective characters and will be left feeling somewhat frustrated by the exercise ."}, "29966": {"id": "29965", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "YET ANOTHER `` INDIE '' FILM ; THIS ONE A COMING OF AGE STORY OF 4 FRIENDS .

I read the book just this past week and liked it a lot ( though it has its own share of flaws ) , and had to see the flick after finishing the novel . While I do n't think this film is terrible , it 's not anywhere near as good as it would have been had Carpenter followed the original story a bit more closely . Just about everything that made the novel special , especially the characterization of the main character Jack Crow , is gone here . Fans of the flick may be surprised to know that Crow is not the flaming a**hole in the book he is here . I found it hard to have any sympathy for Crow or his assistant Montoya . They 're supposed to be hardened by the horrors they 've witnessed and committed , but instead they just come off as self-centered cretins . ( Despite the fact that James Woods is absolutely the perfect choice for the role of Crow . ) That said , even if you 've never read the book , you 'll still find some flaws that ca n't be overlooked . Sheryl Lee overacts something terrible in her role as the prostitue slowly becoming a vampire , and the ending is absolutely ludicrous , defying the film 's own internal logic . Most of the action sequences are done as montages ( ! ) , and the gore is a bit too over-the-top . Maximillian Schell is a fine actor , but his character ( who is n't in the novel ) was unconvincing and obviously merely a walking , talking plot device . There are some heartpounding moments here , like the opening sequence ( one of the few scenes taken pretty much directly from the novel ) and Thomas Ian Griffith makes a nicely scary vampire , even if he 's given about three lines in the whole flick . His origin ( which leads into the origin of vampires in general ) is also quite intriguing . But that 's not enough to save the film.Of course , anybody who 's never read the novel will disagree strongly with this .

If you 're looking for proper widescreen formats in the English language , well , you 're pretty much out of luck . Sure , the English dub is `` bad '' but we expect that usually in Godzilla films . For me , Columbia/TriStar releasing these two 90s Godzilla classics on a single disc , then butchering them further with just a pan and scan ( 4:3 aspect ratio , not widescreen ) is an insult to Godzilla fans.Avoid this release . Even at the current Amazon price it is n't worth the pain.I suppose if you have kids who like Godzilla , they wo n't mind 4:3 aspect ratios an English only . If you are a fan of what Classic Media pulled off on their releases though , this will leave a bitter taste in your mouth ."}, "29986": {"id": "29985", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "GARDENS OF STONE ( 1987 ) Produced and Directed by Francis Ford Coppola . Score by Carmine Coppola.Starring James Caan , Anjelica Huston , Dean Stockwell , Mary Stuart Masterson , Lonette McKee , Laurence Fishburne and James Earl Jones.The film purports to be about the U. S. Army 's Old Guard who handle the burial detail of veterans at Arlington cemetery and three sergents -- two older and one young and the various women and others in their lives during the Vietnam War in the late 60s.Actually what it is is a great -- though not unclever -- Trojan Horse as Coppola -- perhaps disatisfied with how APOCALYPSE NOW came out -- makes another go at the Commie prop Anti Vietnam War film . However it is now 1987 and Ronald Reagan is reducing the Soviet Union to the dust of history and millions are being liberated ... ... ... except for Indochina . And so we have a great many Liberals with egg on their faces who have spent the last two decades smearing the American Soldier and generally making an ass of themselves . So how can we relieve them of the responsibility of their actions ? Well how about the old rhetorical ploy of reversing reality -- when in danger of losing a debate simply accuse your opponent of being what they are against and against what they are for . To wit : A patriotic American is really anti-American . A conservative is really a fascist . Christians are just like Moslem Barbarians . Or here . Have the main military characters be against the Vietnam War . Instead of having the teenage character be the font of wisdom before hapless adults , have the adults be the wise ones ... ... ..as long as it is the teen who supports the war while the adults oppose it . Portray the military characters in a positive light and not as drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists ... ... ..but only those that agree with the Party Line . Those who support the War are still drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists but only offscreen . And finally have the main military character approve of the Leftist antiwar character ( who earlier referred to American 's actions in the War as genocide ) when she tells him that she will do everything in her power to insure America 's defeat to such a degree that he asks her to marry her . SEE ? ? ? The Left are not anti-military ! ! We portrayed two soldiers in a good light and even allowed one of our women to associate with him ! ! SEE ? ? We did not betray the country and the Vietnamese people . The Military ( or rather one member of the military ) agrees with us ! ! ! It was not our fault ! ! We were right ! ! We are always right ... ... ..even when we are wrong.Coppola goes through the motions of pretending to present all sides of the issues but the dialogue is incredibly shallow and empty . Really just variations of `` I 'M FER IT ! ! I 'M AGIN IT ! ! '' repeted ad nauseum . A serious discussion of the Vietnam War pro and con is NOT a conversation Coppola wants to have . The War is presented as being somehow different from all other wars ... ... ..but no one ever says why . Caan 's character is against the War because it is not being fought right ... ... ..but never explains the right way . The young pro-war sergent 's position is little more than `` We beat Hitler..therefore ... ... '' It becomes very obvious by the 75 minute mark that the filmmakers simply do not understand the miliary characters at the heart of the film and are flailing to make them appear human . And the Liberal characters constantly weigh in with their condescending little barbs ( It 's genocide . Anyone who supports the War is immature and ignorant . Soldiers returning from Vietnam are ... .different ... .presumably from all that drooling baby killing . Masterson has a ludicrous speech about returning Vets where I swear I expected her to start intoning `` Even a man who is pure at heart ... ... .. '' ) without ever getting called on it . And it is telling that the film stacks the deck with practically EVERYBODY in the film except the young sergent being against the War ... ... .and even he is made to recant his position at the end ... ... .where upon since he is obviously a drooling nazi hophead baby killer , is killed lest his evil infect the good liberal Masterson with his touch.Aside from the score -- -which is truly hideous -- one can not say the acting is bad . Huston as the smarmy Washington Post reporter has an impossible role ... ... .and makes it work . Caan is good as is Jagger and the rest . And Jones could not give a bad performance if he wanted to . The film looks very nice visually but what sinks it ultimately is the script . Coppola simply does not have the integrity to even attempt a fair debate on the War.The film is not about the War , the abatoir in Indochina , the men who fought it ... ... and in some cases were laid to eternal rest in Arlington having made the ultimate sacrifice for human freedom . It is not about the Old Guard . It is not about that Garden of Stone in Arlington and the men resting there . The film is not about what it pretends to be about.It is about a bunch of useful idiots and functional children who made a great big mess on the floor of the world stage and now want Daddy to make it all better and tell them it was not their fault.It is all very childish and petty.HOWEVER unlike THE KILLING FIELDS , they do not play IMAGINE at the end.See it or not ."}, "29987": {"id": "29986", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "A problem with message movies such as these is that they tread a fine line between being too much of their time and being universal . While this film caused quite a stir in 1967 , watching it today is painful and cringe inducing . It 's strictly a product of its time.The story of an interracial couple ( Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton ) marrying was very radical in 1967 , but today it 's much more accepted . Things are certainly not perfect , but they are much more tolerant than they were 40 years ago . It is important to note that this film was n't done for cheap shock value . Stanley Kramer , the director and producer of the film , was a filmmaker who made socially conscious works throughout most of his career , so a film like this was a natural choice for him . Unfortunately , the film is so dated and so obvious that it 'll make modern audiences cringe . The screenplay ( which won an Oscar ! ) is trite and never goes beyond a sitcom level . The film plays almost like a `` very special '' episode of a sitcom . It takes a worthy subject and makes it as inoffensive as oatmeal . It 's so blanded down . It 's mawkish and overly sentimental as well , which makes it even worse.It 's interesting to contrast this film with a film Poitier made the same year , and that 's To Sir , With Love . He plays an American teaching in a tough East End London school . That film , while a bit corny at times , has n't dated nearly as much as this one , mainly because Poitier 's race is only mentioned once , and just for a few seconds ( there 's a scene where he cut himself , and one of his students foolishly says `` oh , he bleeds red '' ) . To Sir , With Love never telegraphs its punches like Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner does.Many of Kramer 's films have dated . The films of Otto Preminger , another filmmaker who made socially conscious films , have n't dated at all and are still quite potent in their depiction of politics ( his brilliant Advise and Consent ) , the Israeli/Palestinian conflict ( Exodus ) , and drug addiction ( The Man with the Golden Arm ) . Preminger 's work never resorted to maudlin sentimentality ( something screenwriter Dalton Trumbo , who wrote Exodus , admired about Otto ) , and as a result his work is still valid today . While I admire Kramer 's sincerity and choice of subject matter , I ca n't recommend this film . A shame , as it has 3 of the greatest actors to grace the silver screen , and it 's Spencer Tracy 's last film . All 3 of them are excellent , doing their best to make this pap watchable . It 's a pity the film is n't better ."}, "29988": {"id": "29987", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I wish I had read the other reviews here first before purchasing this version .

You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them . Really it 's so unremarkable , so what 's the appeal ? Well the first one was a big success , so obviously it 's riding on the coat tails , but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was , from the opening 'jump scare ' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class , I knew I was in for a craptacular 90 's slasher . So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12 . The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious . `` Ohhh she 's so sweet and innocent , she deserves to live , but the fat stoner deserves to DIE ! Take that people I passively look down on ! `` .Also in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers wo n't be interested , so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it 's just the dark , but wait , it 's the corner of a club with couches and everything , and no one 's sitting there ? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.So eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever , for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive , the maid for example ignores white virgin , `` oooooh , how creepy , she does n't respond '' F*** you that 's stupid . Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible , even though his business seems to be going into the crapper . Then they meet Jack Black playing himself , and the guy seems friendly enough , basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some , then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie ' , there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.So much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production , even the kills are PG-13 caliber ( well by today 's standards ) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing , something ? I do n't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around , apparently as fan service to the girls watching . Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL , or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.Then later we meed biker chick who runs the bar , and while virgin white gurrrl lives , random biker chick is killed off , because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you 'll likely get murdered if you live like that . Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.So OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER , no f***ing s*** , who did n't see that coming a mile away ? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience `` hey I 'm still here '' , then finally shows that he 's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who could n't tell and puts his EVIL FACE ! ! ! on . This wimp is the least threating villain ever , and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever , I stopped paying attention at this point , this movie SUCKS !

I liked the first movie a lot ; it was suspenseful , imaginative , and pretty scary . The acting was generally better too . This time around , the acting and script are pretty irritating . First of all , anyone who knows their geography will get a big clue early in the film . Secondly , Freddie Prinze 's character is such a jerk in the beginning , you ca n't believe his sudden transformation .

Shame the same ca n't be said of this sequel , which crams in every slasher clich & eacute ; known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff . In a fit of apparent desperation , writer Trey Callaway packs Julie ( Hewitt ) , survivor of the first film , off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number . Joining her is fish-faced Karla ( Brandy ) , her boyfriend Tyrell ( Mekhi Pfeiffer , who I seem to remember used to have a promising career ) and spare wheel Will ( Matthew Settle ) . Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman , who engineered the prize ( the fact that Julie 's number 's unlisted does n't set off any warning bells ) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other . There are no boats scheduled for days , the phones do n't work , and there 's a storm on the way ... you get the picture.You can practically hear director Danny Cannon , whose last movie was the underrated `` Judge Dredd '' and who deserves a lot better than this , sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is . Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing ( it 's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings ) ; a couple good scares throughout , though nothing scary , as if any movie could be deemed such ; Freddie Prinze , Jr. is certainly not a notable talent , yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero ; Mekhi Phifer , in a stereotype black tough-guy role , gives his role some enjoyable attitude , but his disbelief of Julie 's claims that a killer 's on the loose become tiring and cruel . `` I Still Know ... '' fails due to a maddening lack of logic , intelligence , and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters ; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we do n't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed ; technically mediocre acting ( except Hewitt ) , plus bothersome , forgettable work from newcomer Brandy ; low-IQ script ; splotches of incompetent directing throughout ; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying `` shocker '' finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years .
