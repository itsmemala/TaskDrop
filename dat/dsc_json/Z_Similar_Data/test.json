'Fierce Tales ' has done a wonderful job of providing a story that is original in the HO gaming field . No ghosts or curses , just a series of odd events that become more intriguing as the game unfolds . There is also a lovely Extra chapter which focuses on the origins of the one man who becomes the central figure of the plot.The HO segments are great , with some calling on the gamer to use certain objects to put together an item to collect . The HO areas do get a bit hidden behind the list of items to collect , but expanding the size overcomes that small problem .

As a bonus , the graphics are super cute . The games are so fun that your child wo n't realize it 's supposed to be educational . This is such a great alternative to other boring methods of teaching math , like flash cards and worksheets . It will hold a child 's attention for a long time because there are so many different games to play , plus you do n't need to supervise them because it 's so easy to use .

The app is very interactive and the interface is perfect for kids with adorable depictions in the form of animals and games . The app 's games are the best part !

This is another fantastic app from 22L ."}, "24180": {"id": "24179", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Just in time for Halloween , Halloween Math Adventure is a great app for helping children learn basic math facts and operations . From the time children enter school to the time they leave , basic math facts are a necessity . Not knowing these facts can cause problems later on as more complex math relies on knowledge of these basic facts . Facts are also crucial for mental math . As a tutor , many of my students experience some difficulty related to not knowing the basic math facts , and we spend a lot of time drilling and practicing them.I 'm happy I found this app because my students love it , and I love the fun Halloween theme . I will continue to use it after Halloween , too- the theme , characters , and games are really great ! What I love most about this app is that it works for pretty much everybody . Younger kids can practice addition and subtraction while older users can work on multiplication and division facts . This makes the app a perfect fit for me , as I work with children of various ages . This , along with 3 difficulty levels , makes it very adaptive to individual players and sure to be useful for a long while ( an amazing value , considering this one cheap app can be used to drill math facts through multiple years and grade levels ) .Users can input their name and choose an avatar- which I love ! Kids love personalization , and the avatars are really cute . The user simply selects what type of facts they want presented ( numbers , addition , subtraction , multiplication , or division ) and the difficulty ( easy-hard ) . The user can then choose which game they want to play . The hardest difficulty involves double digit problems , so I would even argue that this app can be used to teach children a little older than 4th grade as well.In Bingo , a fact is presented and the user must pick the correct answer from a grid of numbered pumpkins . Correct answers are marked and the game ends when a 'bingo ' is achieved . Memory Match has you match math problems and their answers . The game ends once all matches are made and all cards are flipped . I especially like this game because it allows the player to build confidence by completing the problems they know first . It also helps them see which problems were more difficult and identify what to work on in the future.Pumpkin Hunter displays a problem and set of possible solutions . In this game , players have limited lives and time to complete each problem . This is great as most kids enjoy playing against a clock and testing their skills . In Catch a Ghost , players are shown a problem and tap the ghost that has the right answer . This game is similar to Pumpkin Hunter because it is timed and lives are limited . The games are all fun and kids really enjoy the Halloween characters , themes , and sound effects.Overall , this app is a winner ! It includes all types of math facts at multiple difficulties which makes it a great value . Other app developers make each set of problems into individual apps and charge you each time . With 22Learn 's app , you get everything in one convenient package . High scores are tracked and players can enjoy beating their high scores or those of their peers . Settings make it easy to control sound , music , and difficulties . Professional voice acting and colorful illustrations complete this perfect math-fun package ! It was a huge hit with my students , and I 'm sure it 'll be a huge hit for your math learners as well ."}, "24181": {"id": "24180", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "My preschooler loves this game because of how interactive it is .

This has to be the WORST I 've encountered and I 'm shocked because everyone raves about it . I think this must simply be because people have not found the many highly superior ( many Candy themed ) match 3 games out there that are TRULY FREE or very inexpensive to play . This game not only looks pretty shabby ( for a beautiful spectacular looking Candy match 3 game check out the free Candy Deluxe Pro available free here on Amazon ) but it is also so limiting in what it allows you to do that it literally becomes unplayable . Do n't want to wait for two and a half hours when you run out of your very limited 5 lives ? PAY US MONEY or log onto Facebook and spam your friends . Once you reach level 35 the game is truly desperate to get your money so it will not allow you to move to the next level until you pay the ransom or play 3 `` quests '' which are merely levels you have already played . Okay , I can do that . Play and beat the first `` quest '' level and guess what ? You may not play again for 24 hours to do the second quest ! When you beat that one you wait ANOTHER 24 hours to play the final one . This is the only game I have ever played that prohibits you from playing the game . It is n't really much of a game either as it is deliberately and obviously rigged in much the same ways as a carny hucksters game . You will NOT beat a level until the game decides that you will ( generally when you are using your final life - a cynical ploy to get you to pay for more lives ) . Level design is also so difficult that in advanced levels you will almost certainly have to pay for ( outrageously expensive ) `` boosters '' to move on.I really do n't get it . The only explanation for the popularity/social phenomenon nature of this game is that people have not played the MANY better ones . For awesome Candy themed match 3 games try : CANDY DELUXE PRO , CANDY SWIPED , CANDY OF KING , MO CANDY ( that one is 99cents ) , CANDY POP . For great match 3 's in general try JEWEL STAR , JEWEL LEGENDS , DRAGON GEM , HEROES of KALEVALA , SEASONS MATCH ... so many great ones . The ones that require you to pay ( cheap too ) give you the ENTIRE game , not just pay to progress a little further and then pay again . The fawning reviews here mystify me , particularly the ones that seem so happy the game is `` finally '' available on Amazon . The reason the game took so long to come out is so the game will get a huge new influx of players to make it seem like interest in the game is not diminishing ( which it does do fairly quickly , at least for my friends who have tried it and quit playing it when in became annoying ) . CANDY CRUSH is a truly disappointing and I think , rather despicable mess ."}, "24270": {"id": "24269", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Slow load , when it does finally the graphics flicker and the app locks .

Sometimes it goes on for no reason or is very very sensitive : my baby is a very very heavy sleeper to the point where his breathing movement are almost imperceptibly , so the Snuza wo n't register it . It happened a few time making jump from my bed and run.3 . It does n't work if your baby is in his/her swing , bouncing seat , carseat , everything that moves . The snuza pick up the movement in general not your baby 's breathing movement.For this reasons that 's why I do n't give the Snuza a 5 stars review but I 'm still very glad to have it !

I have anxiety issues and always woke up to see if my first child was breathing in the night so I bought the snuza for # 2 . I can sleep all night and not worry because I know this monitor will go off if my baby stops breathing.The first week of my baby 's life this alarm went off anywhere between 10-20 times . Since I did n't know exactly how to clip it on ( I 've just figured out little tricks over time ) it slid or fell off or was just not close enough to her tummy and would alarm . I 'm pretty sure that at least one of the alarms was due to the fact that my baby breathed irregularly though.The Sunza gives me peace of mind . I love that unlike other breathing monitors , this one is cordless , portable and really easy to use . I seriously act as a spokesperson for this thing . It 's literately a lifesaver and in my opinion , is the coolest and most necessary baby item on the market ! UPDATE : Before purchasing this item I was conserned about how often the battery would need to be changed or how long each battery would last . My daughter is 5 months old now and we have n't had to change the battery yet ! the battery light/alarm has gone off a few times in the last 3 months . If the red battery light is on , I just turn the Snuza off and turn it back on again . The battery light goes back to green and works like a charm . I 've had a back up battery on hand since the light first went off but I just wanted to use the original battery as long as I could.We 'll probably pack the Sunza away here in the next few days/weeks . At 5 months my daughter just kicks so much the Snuza falls off and alarms when it 's sitting at the foot of her PJs . So back to the battery concern ...

Either way , that 's a pretty good battery life for something that is used every day for hours at a time.We had very few false alarms with either unit . With my daughter , it was mostly operator error . We did see a slight increase in false alarms when she began sleeping on her stomach , so we began to clip the unit to the back of her diaper and the false alarms stopped . With our son , he is a much more restless baby when going to sleep , so the unit has on occasion become dislodged.The reason I chose the Snuza style monitor over an Angel Care style monitor is because of size and portability .

He was my first and I felt like I had to check on him every 10 minutes because I had read so many things about SIDS . My husband would wake up to find me sleeping with my hand on my son 's chest because I did n't want him to stop breathing in the middle of the night . I found this and did n't think twice about buying it . I paid $ 129 for it in 2012 and it came with a 2 year warranty . I did have to have my unit replaced because it had a defective button and I could n't turn it off after a few months . It was quickly replaced without any problems . I used the monitor on my son until he was about 9 months old , and only stopped because he was sleeping on his stomach and would move a lot causing the alarm to pull off his diaper , making the alarm go off 4-5 times a night.I had my second son recently and pulled this out immediately . It had been a while , so the battery was dead . I went to order a new one , but the manufacturer wants $ 20 for the battery plus $ 10 shipping . I went to my local battery store and they found one that was the same voltage and amps that came with the alarm originally . I put it in and the alarm gave the & # 34 ; low battery & # 34 ; warning . So I turned it off and back on again and it said everything was fine . I 'm not sure why that 's happening , but it does with every battery I 've gotten for it since then.The other issue with the non-original battery , is that it does n't last as long as the one that came with the alarm . I had the replacement alarm for over 6 months and never replaced the battery . I would turn it on and off each time I changed or bathed my son . The non-original batteries last about 2 months without being turned off except when my son it bathed . For diaper changes , I just lay it next to him and usually his movements on the changing table are enough to prevent the alarm from going off . We do n't really take it off except for baths because , like most babies , my son will fall asleep anywhere at anytime and I 'm not going to wake him to put the alarm on.The original version of this that I own has problems again with the buttons . I do n't know if it 's because I was turning it off and on a lot with my first , but it pretty much became impossible to silence or turn off , so I had to buy another one . I was very disappointed when it arrived to find that the box said it only had a 1 year warranty instead of the 2 year that they use to offer . That is the reason I 'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.TIP FOR EXTENDING BATTERY LIFE : Do n't turn it off and on again when changing the baby . Lay it next to them on the changing table and there should be enough movement to prevent the alarm from going off . Only turn it off when you are taking it off the child for baths .

I had read some people had false readings with fans , etc ... with some similar monitors so I tested it alone in any area she sleeps around the house . No problems . She sleeps with a fish tank , a humidifier and sometimes a white noise machine or music . Nothing interferes . The design is really cool , the soft rubber tip sets on the tummy and picks up the tiniest movements when they breath . However , it does not pick up digestive activity , I actually watched it one nap when she had gas bubbles . Silly , maybe , but reassuring . There is no way the baby can accidentally turn it off by moving around either . My baby is a tummy sleeper which has presented a couple of challenges ; One , she will dislodge it when she wiggles around if I am not careful to tighten her diaper properly and make sure the clip is fully seated . Two , it is harder to hear and slightly muffled when it does go off because she is laying on it . We have had two alarms so far . One was definitely a false alarm because the monitor came loose . The second one I am not so sure about because my first instinct was to turn it off before I checked her breathing and messing with it woke her up . At least now I know I will hear it and wake up if it does goes off .

I ca n't even count how many times I 've stood over him looking for the flashing green light telling me everything is okay.There are only two issues that we ran into with this . First , although it is small , it is still huge on a newborn so we did n't feel comfortable using it while his umbilical cord was still attached .

As good as our old model was , this one beats it in every way.IMAGE QUALITY/RANGE/BATTERY LIFEThe quality of the image is great -- in the daytime or very dark . In the darkest room , it 's not a green image or anything , the baby is lit by infrared light that allows you to see the baby rather well in black & white . It transmits 15 frame per second , so the video is rather fluid . The range is crazy far . I was able to go about 300 feet away from the house and it still worked great . After quite a few months , we still have n't had it go dead yet ! The book lists four hours of battery life , which is longer than we ever need.CAMERAThe camera is more compact than the other model and it actually has the ability to use AAA batteries to transmit in addition to the AC adapter . It has a speaker for lullabies and the `` Talk to Baby '' feature I 'll write about below . Remarkably , it has an external temperature probe , which is a testament to the designer 's desire to get an accurate temperature . It also has a nightlight on top that is switchable from the monitor . The green power light on the front is rather annoying to us when it is near us when sleeping , so I covered that up.FEATURESThe thermometer feature is a fantastic bonus -- you have to enable it in the menu , but it is nice to always know that it is not some extreme temperature.Talk to Baby intercom is obviously to talk to the baby , and this is not something my daughter likes , but some kids might do well it . This also opens this kit to other interesting uses -- like a front door monitor.You can play lullabies from the monitor -- with five to choose from . My daughter is n't a fan of this feature either , but maybe yours will ! This was a big annoyance on our last model and this one , too -- the button to play a lullaby is the on the side of the monitor , so if you drop it , hold it wrong or bump the button , you could play a lullaby and wake up the baby . NO ! ! I wish they would add an option in the menu to deactivate those buttons.The last options in the menu are to activate VOX ( silent on the monitor until there is noise ) and the ability to change between multiple cameras.This model has a charging base that appears to have an intelligent charging system that stops charging when the battery is full ( or at least the light goes out when it is charged ) .

I 'm happy to see this new model had made some quantum improvements over their previous model I owned.Excellent Picture QualityThe screen on the base unit is stunning given the size . It almost looks like it 's in HD or something -- the images are super crisp and clear , and the quality is quite good . The viewing angles are excellent too.Excellent Signal and RangeThus far , I have experienced no dropouts or stuttering in my video playback whatsoever . The connection between the base unit and camera is rock solid , even when I went outside with the base unit.Superior Night VisionIt is n't just hype , this Levana baby cam has one of the best night vision capabilities I 've personally used . It comes close to the quality and clarity of my expensive HD video camera 's night vision , which is pretty stellar . It easily captures images in a dark room from over 10 feet away . Not sure why you 'd want a baby cam so far away from what you 're trying to keep an eye on , but you never know , so it 's nice to know the capability is there.Easy User InterfaceThe menus on the base unit are all very clear and easy to follow . Truthfully , I barely looked at the instruction book . My theory is , well designed products should be self explanatory -- the more you have to look at an instruction book , the more I consider the product to be a piece of junk . Products should do the job they 're designed to do with little to no required reading . If not , it 's a sure sign that the product 's design department has failed at their job , and ultimately , have failed their customers as well.No Ferrite CoresMy old Levana had ferrite cores on the cables of both wall chargers for the base and camera ; a seemingly little thing , that 's actually big thing -- and it was n't good . Ferrite cores are those little cylindrical blocks that are sometimes placed on either end of a cable . There 's a technical reason why they do it , all of which matters little to me . Ferrite cores simply get in the way of laying power cables in a neat and clean manner -- and for a baby monitor -- they 're just redundant beyond belief . Thankfully Levana did away with them this time around.LullabiesThis is a cool little function , that for me , sets Levana 's baby monitors apart from the rest . Glad to see they improved upon this nifty feature and even added a couple more lullabies . Just push a button on the base unit , and baby gets to hear a nice lullaby playing from the camera 's speaker.Two-Way Intercom - Great For The Front Door TooExcellent feature ! The base unit can 'listen in ' on the room with the baby cam , and hear everything as if you 're in the same room . But Levana takes it one step better -- the base unit also has a talk button , so you can speak into the base unit , and your voice will be heard in the room with the baby camera from its speaker -- brilliant ! I 'm actually considering using this as an intercom for my front door , so I can SEE who is at the door and actually TALK to them before unlocking and opening the door . And since the camera 's microphone is always on and listening , there 's no need for anyone standing at my door to even push an intercom button to talk to me -- which means I can mount the cam safely inside my screen door where no one can mess with it.Long Lasting BatteryThe camera can be powered with batteries , or the included wall adapter . I have mine plugged into the wall , so I ca n't speak to battery life for that one . But the base unit comes with a rechargeable battery and a charging cradle . I like the cradle because it eliminates the step of having to plug the base into something to charge it . With the charging cradle , you just set the base unit into it and it starts charging automatically . Battery life on the base unit seems to be getting me around 8 hours , which is what the manufacturer estimates , so spot on with that one.Bottom Line - This is a fantastic little baby cam with some great improvements over the old model . Battery life is great , night vision is stellar , excellent picture quality , good range , easy to use interface , and a 2-way intercom all adds up to a winner for me . If you need a baby cam or just want a 2-way intercom with video , this is a really good one . Good luck ."}, "24578": {"id": "24577", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The basics : -good night vision-good battery life for the rechargeable monitor -- a little under the claimed 8 ( edit : actually about 6 after a few months ) -- but the camera should be used with the adapter as even the 3 hour life with rb 's can be a pain-good picture and camera quality-built-in lullabies are a nice touch-sound is clear-range is plenty for all but Trump Tower ( `` Still asleep at 7 am ? !

She does n't always stop crying , but more often than not she stops and looks around : ) The only issue that I have with this , and I 'm not sure if it 's a problem with all of them , or just with my unit , is if she starts crying or screaming REALLY loud , the sound on my receiver will cut out and I ca n't hear her anymore . 90 % of the time she starts out with some gibbering or regular crying , which I always hear and respond to , but very rarely she 'll just start screaming and when she does , the sound will give out , while the lights still light up as normal.As I said , not sure if this is an isolated indecent or what . I have n't read about this happening to anyone else , so it may be just mine . This little glitch aside though , I absolutely recommend this monitor .

Like another reviewer , I 'd prefer a pan-and-tilt camera because my son always seems to move to a spot on the very edge of the screen , but those cameras tend to be almost three times as much as this one . If I were to buy two other cameras ( the monitor being able to select from four sources ) , then I could have my son covered from all directions , and , I imagine , have him feeling paranoid that he is being watched for the rest of his life.The daytime video quality is very good . I 've set the camera up on one end of the living room , which is about 22-feet wide , to watch my son eat his breakfast ( instead of chasing the cat ) as I shave in the bathroom , and from close up to about 15 feet away it 's perfect ; more distant than that is still clear but tends to result in a brief `` where 's Waldo '' moment because the monitor is still a relatively small 2.4 '' in size . This is not really a concern ; I do n't believe new parents will be placing the camera up in any suspended ceilings , 16-feet away from the crib.The night vision is pretty good . Yes , it is `` grainy . '' Even military quality night vision tends to be grainy , with glowing eyes and all that . Of course there is no color-contrast , but from crib-range , the night vision quality is just fine and you can easily identify a sleeping toddler . I was actually impressed by it , having seen it on three different models previously ; I thought this model holds it own nicely.The sound quality , while lauded by others , I thought was not quite up to the standards of the other monitors I 've used in the past . There is a time-lag , first of all , of up to a second in transmission time . I ca n't say the sound quality is bad , but I think it is sub-par compared to the other monitors I 've used ... although to be fair , those monitors were all about twice as expensive as this one . When I use the monitor to `` talk to '' the camera , the sound quality is , again , not as good as the other monitors I 've used.The lullibyes do seem to have better sound quality than incoming voice , but are difficult to control from the monitor . I 've pressed a button accidentally more than once and had the lullibyes begin , and it is n't easy to stop them when this accident occurs . They also always seem to be louder than what the voice is set for , which can be shocking.The on-screen temperature guage is a nice feature , but as with all monitors I 've ever had , the accuracy is open to debate . It 's very localized and will differ , almost assuredly , from the other side of the crib . It 's a good general measuring tool.All in all , I really like the 32111 Jena video monitor . Especially for the very economical price , it is very worth it ."}, "24581": {"id": "24580", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I bought this monitor because my other audio/motion one was starting to act up and I think as my baby has become a toddler it & # 8217 ; d be nice to have the video and I don & # 8217 ; t need the motion anymore . Especially when he moves to a toddler bed and can get up on his own in the night.Things that are great : - The price ! I paid $ 99 . That is cheap for the amount of features you get.- I can talk back to him . I think this will come in handy as he gets older and I can tell him to get back to bed ( when he moves to that toddler bed ) or tell him I hear him and am on my way up.- Battery life . I & # 8217 ; ve not had it off the charger for 8 hours but I & # 8217 ; ve had it off for as long as I need and haven & # 8217 ; t had an issue . At night it sits on my night stand on the charger . My other monitor had two monitors and after 6 months the one monitor had to just stay on the charger at all times . The other one only lasts an hour off the charger now ( I & # 8217 ; ve had them for about a year and a half ) .- Can expand to more cameras . I haven & # 8217 ; t bought the other camera yet , but I do move this one around to other rooms in the house . If he is playing in one room and I need to fold laundry in the other room it is easy to move the camera but once I save up enough pennies I & # 8217 ; ll buy a second camera to just keep in that room.- Temperature . I like knowing the temperature in his room . We keep his door shut and it can get stuffy in there or on the winter nights ( we live in Florida so not that cold ) it can get chilly . At a glance of the screen I know how I need to adjust the a/c . I know I sleep better at the right temperature and of course so does he . And it & # 8217 ; s all about keeping him asleep . Peaceful nights for him mean peaceful nights for me.- Distance from camera to monitor . We live in a 2,400 sqft house . He is on the second floor in the front of the house , our room is on the first floor in the back of the house . You couldn & # 8217 ; t get him farther away . We & # 8217 ; ve never had an issue with the camera and monitor loosing signal.Things that are good : - Video clarity . In the light it & # 8217 ; s better of course . In the dark it is good enough . I have it about 8 feet from him ( mounted on the wall above the crib looking down ) . I & # 8217 ; m sure if I had it closer it & # 8217 ; d be better but then I could only see a smaller area . He is all over the crib so I needed a wide angle shot . Regardless it is plenty good enough to see what I need . You aren & # 8217 ; t going to be able to see your kid breathing with it , if that is what you & # 8217 ; re looking for this one isn & # 8217 ; t the one for you.Things that are ok : - Sound . There are five bars ( one lowest sound , five loudest sound ) . If I have it on 3 it & # 8217 ; s not very loud . If I have it on 4 it & # 8217 ; s the sound level I & # 8217 ; d prefer but you start to get background noise . 1 and 2 is no sound basically . 5 is too much background noise.- The nightlight . I & # 8217 ; d hardly call it that . It isn & # 8217 ; t very bright at all . If anything it & # 8217 ; d just show you enough light to find the camera . We have another nightlight so that isn & # 8217 ; t really anything we needed anyway.- Lullabies . I & # 8217 ; ve only used it once and it annoyed him . He fussed even more so we never use it.Things I don & # 8217 ; t like : - The button placement of the lullabies . They are on the side and when you pick it up it is right where your fingers would press those buttons . My husband has accidentally hit them a few times and then you scramble to quickly turn it off . Not sure why they put them there , it seems like the worst place for those buttons.All in all I & # 8217 ; d recommend this monitor . For the price it is a great video monitor .

I originally had a Britax that we would transfer from vehicle to vehicle so we decided to do a permanent install in my minivan . This of course is only forward facing so if buying for a toddler be aware of that since most toddlers are required to be rear facing until at least the age of 2.Now the installation was a breeze . It took my husband approximately 5 minutes to set up . WIth the latch system there really is nothing to it . This Car Seat can fit any child from 40-120lbs and up to 57 '' so we know this will probably be the only one we 'll need until my toddler is ready for her own.My son without a booster does n't sit securely in the back seat with his seat belt . His seat belt does n't fit him right which is why the booster is needed .

It fits perfectly in my bathroom sink ( I have a larger sink with an oval shape and a faucet that can move to the sides so it 's perfect ) and then stores neatly out of the way . It fills up quite nicely , so my son is somewhat submerged in water . He 's only 6 weeks and fits very well in this ; however , I do see that I will have to use something else in a few months , which I do n't mind . I did n't have the option of using my kitchen sink to bathe my son , so this was a perfect fit for me . My son loves it as well , though I have to admit he is very complacent and has not been picky about anything . At times when my husband is bathing him he holds him a bit unconventionally , and my son has even grabbed the sides of this when he feels unsafe . I still hold his head when he 's in it because I 'm not sure if it would cushion his head enough if he were to bob against it , but as he gets a little older I will probably give him more freedom in this . I just wish it came in more colors.UPDATE : My son finally outgrew it at five months . Well , he actually outgrew it at four months but my husband insisted on using it for another month until his splashing got to be too much for the sink . I kept it hanging in the bathroom because I loved it so much and just did n't want to accept he was too big to use it by giving it away . Then one day I finally had to bathe him in his new bathtub ( I bought the duck infant bathtub , super adorable and my son loves that one now ) inside the big bathtub ( because of his splashing ) , but I had n't gotten around to buying a kneeler yet . I was folding a towel to place on the tile for my knees , when I happened to look over at this hanging on the wall . When folded , it 's a little curvy but just about a good width and length to kneel on . Light bulb goes off and I take the flyte , place it on the floor in front of the tub ( curve towards the tub wall ) , place the towel over it , and kneel on a light and fluffy cloud ( I 'm sure you can just kneel on the towel , but this gives a little spring to the towel ) . No need to spend money on a kneeler , this is perfect for that use once the baby outgrows it ! I was able to kneel just on this without the towel also , but the towel gives a little height so I can reach in the bathtub better . Obviously it 's not worth buying it as just a kneeler since there are cheaper options , but if you 've used this tub for your baby and now he or she has outgrown it , keep using it this way unless you have someone you can give it away too .

I have this stroller in black . I spent hours and hours researching .

My `` nice to have 's '' were a reversible seat , ease of folding , aesthetics , child weight limit and a magnetic peekaboo window . This stroller has everything.What I love about this stroller : -The size of the parent basket is unlike almost all other strollers . This is my favorite part.-The adjustable handlebar goes really low for me ( 5'1 ) and high for my husband ( 6'1 ) . I also looked at the Uppababy Cruz and the lowest handlebar height was still too high for me.-I love reclining the seat with a handle instead of having the pull cords that other strollers have.-The hood size is generous.-Reversible seat to watch/interact with my baby while we 're walking or face him forward and let him look around.-Two peekaboo windows ... and they 're magnetic ! -5 point harness-Folding this stroller is amazing . I do n't have to put it on the ground . It took ~ a week to get used to , but you become a pro quickly . And not to mention the fact that you can fold the stroller with the seat facing either way -- this really sold me ! -Mesh parent pocket in the back is very handy.-Shocks on wheels.Here are the things I do n't love about it : -Heavy-Straps are always getting twisted and therefore difficult to use.-My son 's head rests on the buckle-thing at the top of the straps . In a year from now his head may be above the buckle-thing and it wo n't be a problem , but right now it 's on the lowest setting for my 10 month old ( and he 's actually tall for his age ) .-The handle to recline the seat is really sticky ( but not a big deal , you just get used to how it operates ) .-I wish the mesh pocket on the back had a zipper or some sort of closure because things that I keep in there fall out if I fold the stroller with them in the mesh pocket ( for instance I always like to keep a tube of sunscreen in the mesh pocket ) .-While the shade is generous , it could use an extra pull out , if even just a fabric piece that is tucked under the last fold ( like there is on my Chicco Keyfit 30 infant car seat ) .Overall , this is the most amazing stroller ."}, "24746": {"id": "24745", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "At $ 259 + tax , this was a steal for a stroller with reversible seats . I also ordered the GT wheels so I can use them for walks . This is not my keep-in-car stroller . I have a compact stroller for that purpose . The regular wheels are actually good enough because of the all wheel suspension but the GT wheels are better . For only $ 60 it 's a cheap upgrade . I wish all strollers offered upgradeable wheels.I have a 2010 BJ City Elite so I will compare the versa to the elite . These are the things I do n't like about the Versa . The other strollers I considered were the bugaboo bee and mamas and papas urbo2 . I also returned the Contours Bliss . See my separate review of it . The Uppabay handle was too high for me.FABRICNot a fan of the fabric on the versa . It 's a thick woven fabric . I like the slick nylon-like fabric on my city elite.WHEELSTurns out the plastic wheels provide a pretty smooth ride . However I ordered the GT wheels before I received the stroller . I do like the option of being able to upgrade the wheels.RECLINEThe seat reclines only 3 different angles . The city elite has one of those rope reclines so I can recline the seat to any angle . My 5 month old fussed the first day in the Versa but got use to it the next day . He took two naps in it.HEIGHTI would like the seat to be higher up . Also the entire stroller feels low . The handles adjust but the pivot point is very low compared to the city elite . I 'm only 5'2.FOLDLove the one hand fold but once folded it does not stand on its own . At least the seat folds inward so the seat does n't get dirty I have to lean the stroller against a wall when folded . It 's not convenient so we often end up just leaving the stroller in the hall unfolded.CONCLUSIONIf it was n't for the great price and the GT wheels , I would have gone with the Urbo2 which is $ 600 .

Many of the other strollers we looked at seemed really high and were uncomfortable for us to push . We seriously considered the City Mini , but ultimately went with the Versa because of the larger basket on the bottom . The Versa is heavier than the Mini , but we really wanted that larger basket , and it comes in handy when one of our dogs wants to ride in the bottom and during shopping trips.The seat that the Versa comes with is NOT suitable for newborns . We are using the Britax B-Safe car seat and purchased the adapters that allow the Britax seat to be snapped into the Versa frame . This arrangement has worked really well for us.The Versa folds up very easily and I can fit it ( folded ) in the back of my very small Honda Fit without any issues .

Do n't hesitate"}, "24750": {"id": "24749", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I am a soon-to-be second time mom . When my son was born , we were limited with space and chose a Baby Jogger City Mini , which was perfect at the time because it folded up so easily and fit in a corner inconspicuously . However , I always wanted a full-size stroller with a reversible seat and a bassinet option , so this time around ( now that we 've moved and have more space ) , we started hunting for a full-feature stroller . I will qualify this review with the fact that we were NOT looking for a double stroller because my son barely rides in a stroller anymore , and we were not looking for a light-weight/travel/umbrella stroller . All of the strollers we looked at ranged in the $ 300- $ 900 price range and weighed in at 23-28 lbs.These were the features that were really important to us : reversible seat , easy fold , bassinet option , large easily-accessible basket , suspension and wheels that can handle grass and some smooth trails , well-made seat that can handle a tall child , good canopy coverage , ability to add a glider board.Seat : The seat on the City Versa is made with an attractive , high-quality , durable fabric , which also snaps on and off of the frame easily for cleaning ( I believe it 's machine washable ) . The seat is well-structured , with an adjustable footrest , three recline positions , and a huge canopy with two magnetic-closure windows . The seat is also incredibly easy to reverse and the seat back is 21.5 '' high , which will accommodate tall children . My only minor complaint is that the seat recline mechanism is somewhat `` sticky '' and takes some practice to master , but Baby Jogger 's customer service told me that the mechanism needs some time to `` break in '' and that it should get easier to use over time.Fold : This is what Baby Jogger is truly known for . The fold is FANTASTIC , as it is on all Baby Joggers . You just squeeze a trigger on the back of the seat , fold the seat in half ( facing either direction ! ! ! ) , tug the fold strap and lift up , and `` voila ! '' the stroller is folded and locked ! The only slight drawback is that the stroller does not stand up on its end when it 's folded . However , you can easily stand it on it 's side . The other awesome thing is that Baby Jogger 's glider board also folds up and allows the stroller to fold normally with it attached ! Bassinet : The bassinet is not included , but it 's really nice and clips onto the stroller very easily in either direction . We were able to purchase the bassinet with the stroller ( 2013 models on sale now ) for less than the cost of any other stroller/bassinet combo we looked at.Basket : The basket is HUGE ! It 's also very easy to access , which was really important to me , since I relied on my old Snap N Go 's big basket whenever I went grocery shopping when my son was an infant.Wheels & Suspension : While the wheels that come with the stroller are foam rubber wheels , I know from experience with my old City Mini that they will be fine on cracked sidewalks and moderate grassy surfaces and well-groomed trails . The stroller has a great 4-wheel suspension , and the push on the stroller is incredibly smooth and easy to maneuver . PLUS , Baby Jogger is releasing a `` GT '' forever-air wheel replacement kit this spring/summer for the stroller that will provide even more cushion to the ride ( supposedly the wheel kit will be around $ 50 ) .Glider Board : I 'm going to do a separate review for this , but I 'll just say that the Baby Jogger glider board is a REALLY nice glider board . It is so much more robust than I was expecting , and has a lot of ways to adjust it . Plus , it easily folds up and clips out of the way , while still allowing the stroller to fold normally . It 's a little awkward to fit my tall son on it when the seat is facing forwards , but it works , and everything works perfectly when the seat is facing backwards.For sake of comparison , I also thoroughly tested out all of the following competing models in person : Britax B-Ready , UppaBaby Vista , Mountain Buggy Cosmopolitan , Phil & Ted 's Promenade , UppaBaby Cruz , and the Bugaboo Chameleon . For the price point , there was simply no comparison - the Baby Jogger City Versa won hands-down for features and price . These were the drawbacks to the other models that I came across compared to the Baby Jogger City Versa : Britax B-Ready : Simply too big and bulky - it was hard to get this stroller through the aisles at the baby store , let alone aisles in stores that are not made to be stroller-friendly . This would 've been a big contender if we had wanted a double stroller , though.UppaBaby Vista : The fold was difficult ( and only works with the seat facing forward ) , it was just as wide as the B-Ready , and it 's expensive . Yes , it comes with a lot of extras , including the bassinet , but I 'd rather have the ability to opt out of the extras and buy them a la carte , rather than pay for all of it upfront . While the Vista also offers a huge basket , it has a big bar running right through the middle of it.Mountain Buggy Cosmopolitan : I REALLY wanted to love this stroller , but the handle bar was non-adjustable and too short for my tall husband , and the seat was WAY too short for our tall family ( 17 '' compared to 21.5 '' on the City Versa ) . I also did n't like the fabric in the seat , and I was worried about the long-term durability of this stroller - the floor model was very loose and wobbly and seemed like it had n't held up well.Phil & Ted 's Promenade : This stroller just was n't practical as a single-child stroller . It was REALLY long , difficult to maneuver , and felt awkward as a single.UppaBaby Cruz : This stroller is not nearly as high-quality as the Baby Jogger City Versa or it 's own sister , the UppaBaby Vista . The frame feels flimsy and the wheels would not handle grass or trails well at all . This stroller really competes with the Bugaboo Bee , not with the other strollers on this list.Bugaboo Chameleon : First off , it 's just way too expensive . Bugaboo needs to lower it 's prices because there are plenty of other strollers offering the same features for a lot less these days . The frame feels wobbly and flimsy , and the seat has to be removed before you can fold it.All that being said , we are extremely happy with our decision , and I 'm glad I put in the effort to thoroughly research my options . I still have yet to find a truly `` perfect '' stroller , but the Baby Jogger City Versa is very close ! The only minor complaints I have are truly minor and do n't outweigh the negatives I found in every other stroller . I 'm not surprised I ended up with yet another Baby Jogger stroller ( this is my third ! ) ; I also own a 2010 City Mini and a 2011 Summit XC jogger , both of which have been excellent and have held up wonderfully .

Since the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under the age of 2 , it seems that the bConnect Digital Soother is n't such a good idea either.There is an interactive component to the product where children can scroll to advance two of the applications , however , there 's also a large button on the front of the product which activates the nightlight feature when pushed . This feature is a major design flaw - any baby or toddler that 's interacting with this toy is going to push the large yellow button and unintentionally bring any entertainment to a halt to be greeted with a night light that can only be turned off by pushing the button again.I was particularly looking forward to the feature that enables you to use a memory card to display personal photos and thought this would be great for car trips . Unfortunately , I was never able to get one of my memory cards to successfully work with this product.Overall , it 's an overpriced plastic product .

However , once I put together the bouncer and let my daughter sit in it , I saw that she could n't even really reach the monkey and butterfly toys at the top . She also could n't get the push and pull feature of the toy bars . I do n't know if she 's still too young and only knows how to bat at the toys but it just seemed like to me that she got bored very quickly sitting there staring at toys that she could n't play with . Perhaps an older baby may like this better but according to the bouncer description , you should n't use this on a baby that can sit up on their own and that 's the only way I can see any baby being able to reach up for the high toys . Also , the music and monkey sounds that comes on when you move one of the handles gets really annoying after awhile . It would be good if there was an off button for the music rather than having to just remove the battery . Lastly , I thought the toy bars could be moved to the sides so you can easily take your baby in and out of the chair but it does n't . That means you have to lift your child from the top and slide their legs out from below the toys . Not a big deal but another annoying part of the toy design .

It 's made by Fisher-Price which generally means it will stand the test of time . It is bright and colorful and has cute zoo animals on the front which caught my attention at the very least . However , I really wish I had gone with the Baby Einstein mirror or really any other mirror over this one for a few reasons I will outline below.PROS:1 ) It 's bright and pretty2 ) The songs are entertaining and the lights are cool . The music plays for approximately 10 minutes.3 ) It has a setting to control lights and music , music only , etc . very handy.4 ) The mirror part is large -- which should help you see your baby better.5 ) It comes with a remote control so you can turn the sounds on or off from the front seat ( see cons -- important ) CONS:1 ) The single most annoying thing about this mirror is its lack of stability . It has velcro straps to secure it into place onto your headrest . Sounds good , right ? Well the way it has the velcro , if you hit one little tiny bump ( say a speed bump or a pothole ) the entire mirror shifts and suddenly moves out of place . In a nutshell , it is not very secure . In order to make it truly secure you need better straps or more velcro , or ... something . It is a terrible design with how they put the straps in the first place.2 ) The remote is a GREAT idea ... only problem is , it works when it wants to . Sometimes the remote works , but 75 % of the time , it does n't no matter how many times you hit the giant button . You should see me , driving down the freeway , holding my hand out behind me trying all kinds of different angles to get the music to turn back on . Up , down , side , upside down -- nope nothing . Then I 'll wait a few minutes and try it again , and it will randomly work . Oh and they put the sensor to the remote control on the BOTTOM of the mirror , so if you have a high seat or the angle of the mirror is at an odd angle to where you are sitting ( so you can see the baby better ) , you wo n't hit the sensor . I should note that this is NOT the problem with the remote -- I will literally hold the remote next to the mirror when we are stopped and it still suffers from the same problem of working when it wants to.3 ) The music -- Okay on one hand , playing for 10 minutes is awesome -- until it stops . If the remote worked correctly , then you could start it up again and everyone is happy . Instead , my daughter has meltdowns on the freeway when the music stops and I ca n't get it to start back up again because I 'm in traffic and pulling over just to check on her and restart the toy takes away the whole point of having the mirror in the first place . Worse , 90 % of the time , I 've hit a bump in the road or changed lanes , and the mirror is out of place , so I have no way of knowing if the baby is crying because there is something genuinely wrong or because she 's upset the music stopped . Very frustrating.Ultimately , I really regret spending the money on this . I really wanted to like it , but now I 'm wishing I bought the Baby Einstein one instead ( which you can control how long the music plays for ) . Instead , I 'll probably break down and go pick up some velcro strips to try and make the mirror at least stay put . I would suggest you try it before you buy it and see if it works in your car for you .

Phil and teds quality does not even come close to the BOB quality . The BOB is a real rugged , tough , smooth as a dream ( with built in suspension ) , comfy seats , nice hood , nice storage , etc ... My friends and I had our BOBs for 4 years ( my friend is a exercise nut and a jogger and hiker and uses hers daily ) . Not once did we have to replace a single tire or anything at all , everything still works and functions like it did the day we bought it .

It fits 2 kids but is the size of a singleI like the rear seat recline , it gets a good enough angle for my baby to nap.I like the foot brake , it is easy to engage and is strong.I like the follow the sun hood ( though I prefer an oversized hood that comes all the way down to cover your kid like the BOB.Cons ... .My kids are large in size , around 95th percentile each , and they fit okay in the stroller ( they could have more room , but it is not awful ) . My oldest 's legs and cramped in the front seat , and he would have been too big for the back seat by 1 1/2 . My youngest is tall and lean ... and his legs in the back are already cramped . But , it is not AWFUL , they could just use more leg room . And I worry my youngest 's head will hang off the back seat in another 6 months . And he only has about another 5 lbs before he hits the weight limit ... so he will probably outgrow it before age 2.No shocks , so the ride is bumpy and not very smooth .

He even sits that high up in it when it is in the base in the car . There are two different levels you can set it at ( the Base ) but I find that the setting for smaller babies is still making them sit way too `` up '' . Looks so super fancy in the stroller but my little guy can never nap : ( 2 - The shoulder strap covers have a wire in them which make them stick out .

As background , our first monitor was aPhilips AVENT Baby Monitor , which we like , but it lacks video . Next we tried aGraco True Focus Digital Video Monitor , which has video and great nighttime brightness , but sound issues and daytime quality consistency problems . This item is pretty pricy , especially considering it comes with only a parent unit , not a monitoring unit , and therefore requires you to use your own smartphone , tablet , or computer , and we had high hopes , but it feels like it may have been rushed to market.First , we encountered a minor annoyance during setup ( which overall was easy , so that 's one plus ) . The manual , and a slightly corrected page that shipped with the unit ( telling you to follow that slipsheet instead of the originally printed page ) indicates the user should turn the unit off , hold the reset button , and then turn the power on while still holding the reset button , continuing to hold it until the unit beeps . This resets the unit before use , and is to be repeated anytime you switch wi-fi networks . This never happened for us - I held the button for about 30 seconds , then gave up , turned it off and tried it again , the second attempt holding it for well over a minute . No beep . So instead I turned the unit on first , THEN held the reset button , which was not the process that either the manual or the corrected page indicated , and that worked , eventually . So , first strike , minor bug , no problem.Second , the setup on our iPad was buggy . We had already set up the account on an iPhone without a problem , but the iPad app would not pop up a keyboard ( no external keyboard , so that was n't the issue , and we do n't have this problem with any other apps ) , so it was impossible for us to sign in on the iPad app , unless we went out and purchased an external keyboard just for that . I repeatedly restarted the app , and eventually it just worked on its own . No changes in iPad settings . Another minor software bug , probably something to be fixed in a later patch . No big deal.Third , nighttime quality on this unit is pretty poor , even with brightness cranked up to the max . We did a side-by-side comparison next to the Graco unit linked above , and there was just no contest - the quality on this unit is considerably grainier , and it 's much harder to see details . Motion is also a bit blurry , though some of that is to be expected when over wi-fi ( although note that we have a solid router , and the unit is well within the range ) . This is more of a problem.Fourth , when using the smartphone as the monitoring unit , which to us seems the most convenient given the size , we hear a bizarre purring/vibrating sound . There is nothing on in the baby 's room , and the other two monitors we 've used do not have this problem . The sound sort of pulsates or goes through a crescendo/decrescendo , fading in and out at regular intervals , but it 's always there , even if you turn the volume way down . This bothered us even more than the video quality issue.Fifth , because of the nonstop sound above , we tried not having the smartphone monitor constantly on , instead relying on push notifications . The unit seems to be designed to send you a notification when sound is detected , which would lead you to launch the app and see what 's going on with the baby . This worked right after setup - we went into the room to adjust the camera , and my phone immediately popped up with `` sound detected . '' Success . But then it did not work consistently going forward . It 's not clear whether there 's a huge delay between notifications , and we did n't see any way to adjust that delay if so , but about half an hour later , the baby went down a for a nap ( no notification when we walked in and laid him down ) , and about an hour after that , the baby woke up , and we could hear him talking from another room , but still , no notification from the app . I even turned a `` sound sensitivity '' setting up to max . Nothing . ( But note when I tested the app from work , after logging in , it immediately sent me a `` sound detected ! '' message , even though no one was in the room and it seemed completely silent to me . ) Unfortunately , with the range of problems above , we find this unit to be unusable . Even putting aside setup bugs ( the first of which may just be an error in the manual , the second of which seems a simple software bug that could be patched ) , we have to choose between a constant purring/buzzing from leaving the app open and not being notified when there 's a sound so you should launch the app ( which completely defeats the purpose of having a monitor ) .We are disappointed , and will look forward to further versions of the product in the hopes Motorola works through these issues ."}, "24927": {"id": "24926", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "To set it up , it requires that you download a free Android or iPhone app . Now this was a bit odd that a product can not be set up using my computer . I 'm surprised that the set up requires using an app from the Android or Apple stores . Unfortunately , our Android devices ( two smart phones from Motorola and an older tablet ) are running an older version of Android for which this supposedly free app is not available.We have Windows Phones ( Nokia Lumia 920 ) but I 'm not going to blame Motorola for not releasing an app for the Windows Phone . However , this prerequisite of having one of the latest Android or iOS devices to set it up should be mentioned clearly in the description of the item . I guess if someone does n't have one of the latest smart phones , they should not buy this camera.But what really intrigued me is this : The app it requires us to use to set up and manage this baby monitor is not one developed by Motorola but some third party company called binatonetelecom based in Hong Kong . So if the software vendor stops updating the app or pulls it out of the store , this camera may become useless . As I mentioned , I could *not* find the app from the Google Play store on my device because my Android device was running a slightly older version ( 2.2 ) of Android OS . If you are thinking about buying this camera , it should concern you that even though this camera has a Motorola logo on it , the app that controls it does n't come from Motorola.Lastly , there is a website to manage the camera called monitoreverywhere dot com . This is where they require you to register by creating an account . On that site , there is no mention of `` Motorola '' anywhere . Their FAQ does n't even mention `` Motorola '' once . If you click on `` Contact Us '' , it takes to a page that shows their Hong Kong address with no company name and no phone number . Now again , this is the site that will be used to `` manage '' this camera 's live feed and control the camera . To me , this is a serious privacy concern.I would not even give this product as a gift to someone I care about - let alone use it . *** Update ****After only a few weeks , it stopped powering on .

Read on if you want to hear the gory details , or just skip to the end to see my recommendations for a better alternative.Okay , first , setting this camera up is just about impossible . And I say this as an experienced tech professional who has set up other Wifi PTZ cameras before . This , however , I gave up after 90 minutes of failure.Instead of having some way ( like a USB cable ) for me to configured this from my computer like my oldFoscam FI8918W ( there 's a newer version out there , but I do n't have theFoscam FI8910Wyet ) , there 's fairly involved procedure for resetting the device , having it turn on its own wifi , and configuring it wirelessly through their MonitorAnywhere app on an Android or IPad/IPhone device . You can view the image from a PC , but you ca n't configure it from one , so it would be good for households who only have tablets/smartphones ( if it worked ) . I had to try three or four times to connect to the wifi even with my 3rd generation iPad HD inches away from the camera . Then I went through the whole setup procedure ( the MonitorAnywhere app is horrible , and makes it hard to type where you 're supposed to ) , only to find that something went wrong , and I had to do it again . But wait ! It turns out that it was n't done . In order to set it up , you have to use a MonitorAnywhere app , and this app is too stupid to realize that you might already have a MonitorAnwhere account already set up ( from one of the prior failed attempts ) and let you log in . And hitting back is a BAD idea . So I 'm trying this whole stupid process YET AGAIN , and assuming I get that far , I expect I 'll have to set up another account.I have n't tried this from my Android devices yet , but I 'm not hopeful.Assuming that you get this set up ( I never did ) , you 'll discover why I truly dislike this camera : it appears that it will broadcast my picture and all the sounds it can pick up to some server on the internet . ( It might be using UPnP `` Universal Plug 'n ' Play '' to open up holes in my home firewall , but that 's just as bad if not worse . ) It 's actually a half decent idea , since it 's nice to be able to be at dinner and see that the babysitter has indeed put the kids to bed on time . But I ca n't disable it . So I just have to trust that the good folks at Motorola are using a secured protocol for the transmission and have locked their servers & cameras so hackers ca n't get in and access video of my children or overhear conversations in the house , like when my wife asks for my credit card number.To give Motorola a *little* credit , their solution is a bit better than the basic method that seems to be popular with Foscam users , which is just use port forwarding on their router . At least the Motorola method uses a password.Here 's a better option : get a router with a VPN , like theASUS RT-N66U . It has OpenVPN built in , so you can securely connect to your home network from anywhere . OpenVPN is supported by both Android and iOS . This way , when you connect to your Foscams from the restaurant , your kids pictures never leaves your ( extended ) private network . And you can probably do all of that for about the same price or less than a single Blink1 ( based on the Amazon price for this camera as of the time I write the review ) .

The initial setup is relatively easy and requires a free app / program . However , setup was longer than expected on my iPad as it took several minutes to recognize the camera and several more to link . Setup on my Android phone was much faster . Once linked , the camera is very easy to control and response is fast on both devises . When viewing on the iPad there is a rhythmic click , even with the camera sound turned off the click persists so the issue appears be with the app or video and not the camera 's audio.The Blink1 gives you the option of receiving alerts for temperature extremes and noise , a great idea if it worked in a timely manner . It took at least 20 minutes to receive sound alerts on my Android phone which is way to long . Alerts to not appear to be an option on the iPad . You also have the option of recording the video feed but this is `` not yet supported '' on the iPad . On Android you can not choose the file path where the video is saved so it is buried on your phone rather than showing in you videos . Still photos work on both devices as expected.Motorola is obviously still working on getting the software where it needs to be , hopefully it wont take it several releases tog to it there . If you are ok not having the temperature reading and the ability to remotely play lullabies you can find cheaper options but the Blink1 has good potential if they can correct the issues .

I 'm fairly certain the download issue is not due to my internet speed.On my iPhone 5 and iPad 2 , I had no problem downloading the app and connecting to the camera but I was disappointed again .

But , we returned it and got the Blink 1 monitor because we were excited about the ability to view the baby from remote locations . However , this monitor was a huge disappointment.First , while the monitor packaging claims that it can connect with other cameras , when I called Motorola , they did n't have additional cameras that could connect to the system at this time . I guess you 'd have to buy an entirely different system at full price , instead of spending an extra $ 50- $ 100 for an additional camera like the other Motorola monitor systems.As for the function of the Blink 1 Monitor system itself : The sound is delayed by at least 30 seconds and sometimes up to a minute . The video is real time , just the sound is delayed.There is a constant static sound in the background . You have to turn your phone volume all the way up to hear the baby , but the static covers up most of the sound the baby makes anyway . No quiet evenings when this monitor is on ! The sound would cut in and out 10-20 times each minute , also making it difficult to hear what was going on in the baby 's room.If you get a phone call or open certain apps on your phone , the monitor app will turn off and not alert you . This is particularly worrisome at night , because we woke up the next morning realizing that our monitor had turned off sometime in the middle of the night . When I spoke with Motorola about this , they said that is just how the app works and there is nothing they can do about it.The picture is low quality , and there is no noticeable difference between the high and regular quality settings.We were unable to view the baby unless we were on the same network as the monitor , so it did not work remotely . I also had a difficult time trying to set up the remote viewing online , and was unable to ever get it working.I called Motorola to share my concerns and spent 30 minutes or more trouble shooting my problems before they offered to mail us a replacement . After waiting a week with no monitor , the new one came in the mail ( an ugly red color , instead of the black one we originally purchased ) . The new monitor was slightly better in the trouble areas mentioned above , but in no way made me feel like it was a safe , reliable monitor ( there was still static in the sound , and the sound still cut out multiple times a minute ) . Now we have to deal with the hassle of returning both monitors .

When the opportunity to try this one came up , I jumped on the idea ! We have our iPhones and iPads handy almost all the time , so it sounded ideal ... Not so much.Summary : Setup was easy . Video is lack-luster , sound is meh and crackly . The internet aspect slows things down from the moment you try to log on . Quality and user experience are severely limited by the Internet involvement.Setup : Software : App install was quick and easy.Camera : Set up was annoying but not terrible . You have to make an account on their server , even if you only want to stream within your own house . And then you have to configure the camera for your network ( which involves the camera starting its own default network , you joining that network with your phone , configuring the camera to join your network then switching back to your network with your phone ) . That went well and the instructions were very clear.Login : I find it takes forever for the app to log me in . It 's annoying and unnecessary . It also means that you can not run it exclusively locally even if you want to . If you lose internet , you probably lose the baby monitor . ( I did not test this , personally . ) Video : The video quality on this camera is poorer than the Summer Infant one . The night vision works , but it makes the room and crib look hazy , like a dark , smokey bar . ( Summer Infant 's makes it look like surveillance tape , but it 's clearer and easier to discern what 's what . ) Both cameras use infrared LEDs for night vision.During the day , it 's ok , but still not as clear as the Summer Infant camera.The picture looked much better on the phones than the tablets - the resolution is n't there for larger images . The zoom is digital , so it 's not actually useful ( same pixels , just larger ! ) . Switching between high and low quality made no visible difference.Sound : I could not get rid of the crackly static noise from the camera . I tried different rooms , different angles ... Also , I could not get the push-to-talk to work.There is a slight delay - maybe 2 beats - in sound and video.Controls : There 's definitely a delay between pressing the button to move the camera and the camera moving.Loss of connection : If the camera loses connection , the device you 're monitoring on will beep . Loudly . It 's a nice beep - like an industrial elevator beep - but still quite loud . Just what you do n't want to hear in the middle of the night , right ? We did try connecting from offsite and that was easy if also slow . Video was very clunky at that point.Plus it 's expensive.The room temperature display is kind of neat , but not nearly enough to make up for the short-comings.Conclusion : There are more tests we could have done but this small amount of testing turned up enough clunkiness that we decided this was n't for us ."}, "24936": {"id": "24935", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I was really excited to try out this product .

At this point , I do not recommend.OLD REVIEW : First and foremost , Amazon shipped fast , arrived in good shape , good job again Amazon . The Motorola Blink1 Wi-Fi video camera is a great option for those who are expecting a newborn in the near future . I have older kids now , so my reason of snagging one of these was to monitor my wife and her misadventures while I am away on business ( I kid I kid ) . I set this up in my kitchen to keep an eye on my pets when we are out of the house , as well as maybe catch a burglar and alert the police . Setup is pretty easy , just hold reset till beep , download app , install software , sign up , and your good to go . The camera has some cool options like pan and tilt and listen and talk ( you can scare some folks.. heheh ) . A temperature reading is also good just in case you are conscious about your home heat/cooling bill . Daylight visibility is pretty good . Nightime camera visibility is ok ( then again , its a cheap night time camera , this is no $ 5k surveillance camera ) .I am pretty impressed with this setup . A few bugs and hiccups here and there , and some better software improvements might knock this review to a 5 star . Overall , I recommend ."}, "24938": {"id": "24937", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "UPDATE : This cam is actually a Wanscam JW0004 Wifi Baby Monitor . I 'm looking for the original firmware and am planning to wipe the Motorola version clean and get it back to a stock Wanscam . It may actually turn out useful if I can get rid of the crappy software on it now , and get it running as it was originally intended . Interesting how it only costs 55 bucks as opposed to two-fifty for this iteration . 50 bucks is about right for this cam.And now back to the original review ... ..I really wanted to like this cam . But the price is just far too high to justify the seriously hampered functionality . If you 're a tech challenged customer , then you might be drawn to the innocuous setup , compared to a Foscam FI8910W , which requires minimal IP knowledge . I get it - parents are busy enough , and do n't necessarily want to learn basic IP config . However , my setup of this Motorola was n't exactly problem free , and if you can handle following a couple paragraphs of instructions , then Foscam will deliver far more than this Motorola ever could. > Incompatible With Latest Java on PCMotorola has all kinds of warnings on their website saying this cam is NOT compatible with the latest version of Java . Motorola 's solution ? Downgrade to an older version of Java , just so this crappy little cam can work . Personally , I do n't think it 's worth the trade-off . Java usually only updates their platform when there 's a security vulnerability . So downgrading to a less secure version of Java just so I can use this cam , is NOT an acceptable solution . Get your act together Motorola . It 's your job to get this stuff working with the software that you selected to use it with . You did n't have to pick a Java interface , but you did , so make it play nice with Java , or scrap it , and come up with an alternative . *Note* - If I open a web browser and type in this cam 's IP address , I can access it directly and control the Pan & Tilt . It just does n't seem to work with Motorola 's online software for some reason. > Wonky Setup on AndroidI downloaded Motorola 's Android app , and setup was hardly quick and easy . The setup kept failing and I had to run it about 6 times before it finally worked . The process was very slow , buggy , and took 45 minutes of tinkering . Hardly user friendly for someone looking for a quick and easy setup . And I know what I 'm doing ( I can get a Foscam working within 5min out of the box . ) The process is sorely lacking in a manual setup option , and the automated one barely works . Advanced users are shackled to a buggy automated setup , and the tech challenged would certainly be lost in the quagmire , so who is benefiting from the `` convenience '' here ? > Limited FunctionalityI do n't really get the concept of a `` baby '' cam . Since when do parents ONLY want to keep an eye on their children when they 're toddlers ? What parents really need is an affordable security system . With multiple cameras and the ability to record and playback footage , just like a DVR . Yes , you want to watch your baby . But when they 're old enough to crawl into another room , do n't you want to keep an eye on that too ? Maybe check in on them , and the babysitter , when you go enjoy dinner on a rare night out ? Or make sure your teenage kids are n't at home cutting school while you 're at work . Or if one of life 's little accidents happen , would n't it be nice to check the security footage and see exactly what happened ? All this IS possible with Foscam , and NOT even remotely possible with this Motorola in its current form. > Small AntennaYou 're not getting very far from your router with this thing . And the antenna ca n't be upgraded , so that 's that. > No Network PortJust because something can be wireless , does n't mean it always should be . I have a lot of WiFi cams on our security setup , however , I always run a network cable to the cams whenever possible . Fact is , wired is just more reliable than wireless . So when possible , run a wire , and save the wireless for situations where it 's the only option . It 'll reduce the radio frequencies swarming around your environment , and the devices that are hooked up wirelessly , will work better as a result. > Poor Image QualityThe resolution just is n't there , no matter if I use standard or HQ settings . This Motorola looks more like a cheap webcam than an expensive WiFi baby monitor. > Pan & Tilt Is ResponsiveGood news here - the pan and tilt functions are snappy and responsive . And the digital zoom is ok. > LullabiesNice feature that works well . But the volume is quite low . Do n't recall seeing an adjustment for it. > Local and Remote ViewingLocal viewing means you 're NOT accessing the cam through the internet . Which is a good thing , because that means you can watch the cam all day long at home , and not rack up any extra data charges . When you 're away from home , you can remotely check in on the cam for up to 5 minutes at a time . Then you have to reload the video stream . They do this so people are cognizant of how much data they may be using on their cell phones or work computers . It 's a good thing. > Night Vision - it 's ok. > Audio - it 's ok too . > Compact - Foscam is larger , but does more. > Limited Mounting Options - either place this Motorola on a desk or shelf , or hang it from the one screw hole on the back . Problem is , cameras like this need to be hung upside-down , not sideways on a wall . Why ? Because all your images will be skewed and off kilter if you hang this on a wall . I call it `` Batman Supervillan Angles '' cuz on the old TV show , the bad guys were always shown with tilted angles , cuz they 're 'crooked ' crooks . Not a good thing for a baby cam.Bottom Line - this cam costs far too much and does far too little . And what little it can do , it does n't do very well . Just not worth the cost or trouble to setup . Not to beat the drum here , but again go with Foscam if you at all want anything decent . No I do n't work for them , they just make really good stuff and i know that cuz I 've tried a lot of security cams . As it is , this Motorola needs some serious upgrades , and the price should be cut by half , at least . Avoid , IMO .

I have no problem with it just being Android or iPhone , but when it 's not advertised as such there is a serious problem , especially such a high-priced item .

That is the comparison I intend to make.The Foscam and the Motorola Blink have almost exactly the same feature set . Except for the following : - Blink allows for digital zoom . If you do n't know , `` digital '' zoom universally sucks . Its not the zoom you think it is . You want `` analog '' zoom , which none of the products in this category provide . I see digitial zoom as a non-feature . No one will want it . Your resolution reduces inversely to the amount you zoom . In other words , you do n't increase the amount of information you are viewing . You simply pixilate and otherwise destroy the image in cropping out the edges and making the interior pixels larger.- Blink allows for room temperature display . This is cool , and is one of two features that are both DISTINCT and USEFUL over the Foscam product.- The second DISTINCT and USEFUL feature of the Blink is the lullaby feature . I have an old ipod and speakers for my baby 's room , so I do n't need the lullabye feature . But for some folks out there , I 'm sure that feature alone is worth the price of admission.That 's it , the rest of the feature set is mirrored in the Foscam.Ok , so you 're still reading ? Here 's the payoff . This product costs $ 250 . Wow . Just WOW . The Foscam product is routinely found for $ 65- $ 85 . That 's a savings of $ 165- $ 185 . I own 3 of them , and can attest that the Foscam 8910 is NOT superior to the BLINK ... but simply matches it 99 % feature for feature ( no temperature readings , no lullabyes ) and then absolutely blows it away on price.I 'll update my review if my Blink grows wings and learns to make me coffee ... or if one of my Foscam 's bursts into flames and burns down my house ."}, "24942": {"id": "24941", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "In order to use this product , you have to create a user account at monitoreverywhere.com .

Now let 's look at how the camera works . From what I can gather , it goes like this : Rather than configuring your router to allow you to stream data directly from the device , your camera sends all of its a information to their central server . You then connect to their server using the account you set up ( above ) and stream the data from them . OK , I can see how this makes set up much easier for the average person , but I 'm not very comfortable about the fact that there is a live stream of data going to a central server somewhere that has all kinds of automatically gathered data associated with it . Remember when they said they automatically store `` certain information like IP address [ and ] cookies '' ? Well , other easily obtained information can include a your physical location . OK , not your exact address , but your city is usually pretty easily obtainable . So now if they get hacked , you are sharing a live video stream of something in your house and a general idea of where you live . But wait -- it gets better . From what I can tell , you set the camera 's WiFi access from their site . That means you give the SSID and password and they send it to the camera . I can only assume that the camera has built in cell access for the initial set up and then uses WiFi only after that ( and it would make sense since it is a Motorola product ) .So let 's recap ... 1 ) In order to use the product , you have to provide > > a ) your name and email address . You must use an accurate email and you must keep it up to date > > b ) your SSID and wireless password2 ) Any information you provide to them becomes theirs forever and they can do whatever they want with it3 ) They can share whatever they want with whomever they feel they `` need '' to share it with ( though you could `` need '' to share anything for one reason or another ... like I `` need '' to share your information with this advertising group so that I can make more money ) 4 ) You are streaming live video of things in your home to their central servers5 ) While they claim they will secure your data , they ca n't make any guarantees.BUT WAIT -- THERE 'S MORE ! Also at the time of this review , the most recent version of the Java VM wo n't work with their program ( version 7 , update 21 ) . You have to uninstall that version and install an older version to get it to work . Now I 'm not sure what the specific changes between update 17 ( the one they recommend ) and update 21 , but usually these updates have to do with added security . So using this product on your computer means you have to lower your security . Nice.I have n't used this product at all because I 'm not comfortable with the terms I have to agree to in order to use it . I do not intend to use it.To fix these problems , this is what I want to see:1 ) Allow an option to stream data directly from my device . Yes , I realize I 'll need to set up some port forwarding and create a dynamic DNS entry , but that 's what I did with my security system and it really was n't that bad.2 ) Do n't require me to register with your site if I stream directly from the device . There would be no need and so I do n't want to share this information with you.3 ) Get rid of the cell communication ( if that 's what you have ) and provide an interface for me to interact directly with the camera so that I can set up the WiFi . This could be by means of a USB or other hard-wired interface , OR even better ... BONUS4 ) Provide a dedicated monitor so that I do n't have to download any apps to my phone or turn on the computer to view the baby . If the monitor had a keyboard , I could use it to set up the WiFi , as well.The product looks like it would work great , but I 'm not comfortable using it the way things stand.NOT RECOMMENDED"}, "24943": {"id": "24942", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This tub toy is just ok .

The only usable sounds are the two ( yes , only 2 ) nature sounds ... birds ... crickets/owl . The rest are guaranteed to keep your baby awake . They 're OK if it 's not sleep time , but typically we put our boy in the swing to chill out , not to get ramped up . Also , the swing makes a constant knocking noise which is very annoying . The mobile 's motor is also noisy . Cheap motors all around . Think about it . If you can replace this motor with the tiny little motor of a $ 10 air freshener , how great a piece of equipment can this be ? We had 3 of the previous model ... the motors all burned out . FP is very good with returns and warranty replacements , but it 's still a hassle . I 'd rather have one that works for more than a few months that has no warranty , than one that constantly drops dead with a great warranty . Why ca n't somebody put together a HIGH-QUALITY baby swing with decent a weight limit with a strong , quality motor ? Oh , before I forget . There is a padded insert for smaller babies . With this insert , it 's comfortable . Take it out when your baby is larger , and you have a pretty uncomfortable , hard seat with minimal padding . You can actually feel the hard plastic edges of the seat through the cheap cover that contains so little padding it 's ridiculous . If you were going to design a swing for INFANTS , would n't you do whatever possible to make the thing comfortable ? 20 cents worth of foam would do it . They cheaped out by stuffing the cover with so little that except for the very exterior ( that looks nice and fluffy in the photo ) , the inside is not much thicker than a pillow case . So we kept the insert in for our 7 month old . If he 's swaddled , we ca n't snap both latches because the straps are too short .

The positive reviews of a mommy blog I love pushed me to make the purchase.I woke this morning after baby slept through the night ( yay ) and after baby nursed only a little and I had some still very lumpy ducts , I was excited to try the flanges out . I expected a huge output ( I did n't even nurse at all on one side ) , and got next to nothing - exactly half of what I typically get in the same scenario with regular flanges . I was n't close to empty and had to stop because I hate pumping for too long - and these were not any more comfortable than the Medela flanges.Other problems : I use a PumpEase hands-free bra pumping bra ; the medium flanges were difficult to fit through the openings ... ca n't imagine trying the large.When I went to take the flanges out of the bra , milk came pouring down the flange in the wrong direction ! I feel like the ridges actually helped some milk escape . With my other flanges I would just lean forward before removing to prevent this , but that did n't seem to help in this case.Later , while nursing my son , I looked at how he was latched . I 'm not an engineer , but I breastfeed full-time . There may be the slightest angle , but for the most part , he latches straight-on . In the diagram on Pumpin Pals website , the & # 34 ; proper baby latch & # 34 ; reflects what I imagine a baby nursing with mother well-reclined or on her back looks like ( positions suggested to help discourage a strong let-down from inundating baby with TOO MUCH milk at once ) . I Googled unbiased diagrams , and lo-and-behold , the nipple goes straight back into the mouth - NOT at an extreme downward angle , and even bends upward in the back of the mouth in some diagrams ! I wanted to love this product and I am all for parent-invented products , but these did not help me , and upon closer inspection , it makes sense that they did not .

I am a 38 DDD and use 27 mm Medela flanges , but find the Medium ( aka smallest ) Pumpin Pal flanges work best for me . The middle size ( aka large ) is ok , but I tend to see a small decrease in output with that size . However , with the Medium , the exact same amount of nipple and areola are being pulled in as the Medela flange , so again , not seeing a huge difference.The shape , while advertised as allowing you to lean back and be more comfortable , really is n't much different from the Medelas . Stick them in some bottles side by side and you 'll see . The downward angle is visible a bit , but if I do n't lean forward slightly the milk does n't go down . This is not a suction issue , I use a Medela Symphony to pump . The one advantage to the shape that I have noticed is that I use my hands free bra to pump while driving and the slight difference is just enough to be more comfortable when you have a steering wheel in front of you.Overall it 's not a huge difference in comfort , output , or even shape from my Medela flanges , so I just use them as extra sets when the Medelas are dirty ."}, "24989": {"id": "24988", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Let 's start by saying I have a lot of trouble at the pump .

I thought it was a near perfect phablet , except for just two main areas for improvement : Screen resolution/sunlight legibility , and after a while there was noticeable slowdown after too many apps were installed . Now that I have the Note 3 , things are getting very very interesting ... .Lets do this review by bulletin points for easier viewing : PROS:1 ) The biggest and most obvious different when you first pick this up is the screen . There are a handful of improvements : * The resolution has been upgraded to 1080p ( from 720p ) . You can noticeably tell that it is crisper . * You will also find out that it is a bit brighter . For us geeks , that means Samsung has upped the brightness levels to an incredible and unheard of 660 cd/m2 max ( when auto brightness is turned on ) . * Sunlight legibility is MUCH improved over the Note 2 . However , it is still not as good as the HTC One 's screen . The Super AMOLED has AWESOME contrast levels ( velvety deep blacks ) . As a whole however , and because of its Pentile pixel system , it comes just a bit short of the HTC One 's Super LCD 3 . It is really nitpicking though , so you wo n't ever regret this.2 ) This phone flies , almost literally . The Samsung Exynos Octa-core/Snapdragon 800 processors mean this thing will hardly ever lag , and 3GB of RAM means you can multi-task to your heart 's content ! 3 ) Improved S-Pen hardware/software mean it 's no longer a gimmick gadget from the original Note . Too much to describe all the functions , and you can do without it for most functions . But business users will really appreciate this once you work on productivity/design apps.4 ) All those software features ! Granted , you can do without most of them for day-to-day things , but being there nonetheless means it will improve your ease of use . The are also too many to go through all , I but what I love most is the Smart-Stay , which uses the front camera to monitor that you 're looking at the screen and wo n't dim/turn off , which is super duper useful for when you are reading the news/web pages , etc. , holding the phone up with one hand , and your other hand is pre-occupied . No more having to shuffle around to tap the screen when it auto-dims to bring the brightness back up . This is especially and specifically useful for me when I 'm reading in bed on my Pulse News app.5 ) The sound is noticeably louder as well . It does n't have that immersive stereo effect of the HTC One 's dual stereo speakers , but by itself it is louder . This is useful when you are in a noisy environment , and having one loud speaker is more useful than having two immersive speakers that are softer and harder to hear . As good as the HTC One sounds , I hate that for most things like music and video , it is so darn soft and frustrating . I now appreciate this one loud speaker setup more for regular everyday outdoors use.6 ) Having a huge battery means I can do whatever the heck I want with it , and even after heavy use I can still not have to charge it until I 'm in bed at night . The one thing that frustrates me most about the HTC One is this very flaw - I literally have to be near a charger/portable charger ALL THE TIME . I just use it to read the news for about 30-40 minutes and 20 % will already be gone . And when I charge it , it trickle charges like a turtle ! With the Note 3 , being able to replace the battery is an added plus , and the USB 3 port means it can charge very quickly . But even these two advantages can not compare to the simple fact that it has a huge-capacity battery in the first place.CONS : There are few things you can nitpick , like the design/material quality - for a flagship device it still feels a bit chintzy , not like the premium look and feel of the HTC One or even the Sony/Nokia phones . With rumors of a new Galaxy line , this may be changed very soon though . Also , the Touchwiz user interface can be hit or miss . It 's not for everyone , that 's for sure . Luckily , being Android means we 'll never have to settle . My recommendation - especially if you like the simple/minimalistic look , is Smart Launcher Pro . Try the free lite version and see for yourself.I ca n't think of much else really to fault this phone , except for the fact that simply for what it is : It 's a niche machine that 's half tablet/half phone - it will never satisfy you as a tablet replacement ( I feel the perfect size for video/game usage is the 8-9 inch range ) , and it will frustrate you as a phone because you can never comfortably hold it , and do all the things you need one-handed ( I feel the perfect size for a PHONE is the Apple 5/5S ) . But if you can compromise to this form factor and accept it for what it is , then there is no better alternative . This is a nearly flawless phablet with an brilliant screen , powerful hardware , useful software , and awesome battery life ."}, "25005": {"id": "25004", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "excellent phone i use in venezuela whit 4g Whit Digitel and is faster and powerfull i love that phone i recomend for all peoples likes better and excellent phone"}, "25006": {"id": "25005", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I am very happy with my phone because i can use it in europe also . i got it very fast and it works great i love the prone"}, "25007": {"id": "25006", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This smartphone is awesome , powerful , bright , excellent battery . size is not a problem due to many accesories are available including cases ."}, "25008": {"id": "25007", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "My only problem with the Note 3 is Knox .

I always hated them , and have an iPhone since v1 . Since the iPhone 5 , I opted to not have any screen saver whatsoever . I felt Apple 's screen was made well enough to go without . But then a year ago I dropped my phone outside on the concrete and it fell just right and cracked the entire screen . Had to go into the Apple store that night and get a new phone . But I still did n't use a screensaver even after that . Then the other day I was looking at my iPhone 5s ' screen and noticed a few tiny hairline scratches . If my phone is n't in my pocket , it 's on my desk . I keep it very safe and rarely drop it . But then I read about tempered glass screen protectors so I investigated and purchased the Bear Motion one based on reviews and the thinness . I wanted the thinnest one possible and as of this writing , .2mm is the thinnest.I received it today and immediately put it on . After I took it out of its packaging I said to myself , & # 34 ; this is glass ? & # 34 ; It seemed to thin to be glass , so it must be plastic , right ? Nope . It 's not . Amazing . I cleaned up my iPhone 5s using my own microfiber towel and the hot air from my lungs , then used their microfiber cleaning cloth included with the packaging . Peeled off the back and using four fingers , slowly lowered it down onto the glass of my phone , positioning it just perfectly.To my amazement , my placement was spot-on perfect and not only that , to watch it magically adhere within 1 second blew me away . I mean ... you could see it clear the air and adhere on its own . I did n't even have to press it . down . Nothing short of magic here , folks . No bubbles . Perfect alignment . This was , by far , the easiest screen saver I have _ever_ installed on any device I 've ever owned . Still not convinced it was that easy , I pressed down everywhere on the cover just to make sure . It seemed futile , though . It was already on there.Mind : Blown.So here 's the wrap-up so far . I 'll update my review as I continue to use it : Pros : - Great packaging ( does n't need much to be honest ) - Easiest installation EVER- Magical self-adhering- Thin as can be . Do n't get anything thicker than .2mm or you will regret it- Does not interfere with any cases I have , including my Mophie case- Clear as can be . Does not reduce the quality of Apple 's screen or touch/gestures- I can no longer see the hairline scratches in the iPhone 's screen that I noticed before . It did a nice & # 34 ; coverup & # 34 ; Cons : - As thin as it is , my home button ( Touch ID ) still seems like a deeper press . My finger hits the edges of the glass every time which is a bit annoying . However , the Touch ID works fine . Just feels like I 'm pressing into a deeper hole because of the glass on top.- The edges of the glass do n't seem smooth as I 'd like them to be , including the home button cutout . The outside edges do n't bother me much here ... it 's the home button 's edges that need to be smoother . Perhaps this just is n't possible with glass this thin ? I will continue to update this as I spend more time with it . These , so far , are just my initial thoughts on this product . If all goes well I am going to buy 2 more for the other iPhones in my family ."}, "25168": {"id": "25167", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Great items , cheaper than MIME or Spigen but does the job .

If you 've done screen protectors installations before , these are just as easy or even easier to install . I used the bathroom with the hot shower trick to minimize any airborne dusts . Once everything settled , it was just a matter of aligning the protectors with the phone 's screen and dropping them . Squeeze a little and your done.The Bear Motion glass protector is .2 mm thin and is definitely thinner than the other .4 mm glass protectors . I compared it to my old Bodyguardz I used on my Galaxy S4 and my wife 's iPhone 5s . What I really love about them is how they feel . The Bodyguardz did not have the same oleophobic properties as the Bear Motions protectors . These BM protectors are also very smooth and slippery , even more slippery than my Note 3 's screen . I can really feel it when using the s pen . Also , because they 're so thin , there 's no need to use button stickers to raise the home button on the Note 3 . They are almost flushed . On the iPhone , the button is not as deep as with the Bodyguardz protector . In addition , the rounded edge of the BM screen protector makes it easier to handle the phone specially on the iPhone . This allows a more comfortable feel specially when using the fingerprint scanner . In comparison , the Bodyguardz screen protector felt like you 're going to cut your skin when using the fingerprint scanner.I almost bought the Spigen glass protector because I also bought their New Hybrid case for my Note 3 .

Unfortunately that did not last . The part of the case that holds the door and the hinge together snapped off and essentially the case came apart.Luckily for me Spigen announced that they would cover this cases for an extra 2 years or so with their new cases and I was told on twitter that it also applied to their past cases ( I forget exact coverage years ) . I was able to get a replacement by sending them photos via twitter and email and I honestly expected to get brand new case but no . What I got was a replacement door . I contacted them again and sent them better photos and told them that the door is not the only thing broken . They apologized and sent me the plastic cover that holds the hinge and door and goes over the silicone portion of the case . At this point I just gave up and used what they gave me since it worked ... for a month.That same plastic part of the case broke and the door continues to pop out now but they have not responded to my twitter complaints and frankly I am tired of their slow service so a negative review it is.I have never dropped my phone , banged it or let if take any damage .

The colored shell is very slippery . Because of the slippery nature of the colored plastic , the phone is very hard to grasp securely . I 'm always afraid that when I go to pick the phone up , after it has been sitting on a desk or table , I am going to drop it.This case , for me , does not instill a feeling of security while holding the phone . The colored hard outer shell needs to have a rubber grip along both sides below the power and volume rocker . This design would provide something sticky rather than slippery to assist grasping the phone when lifting it from a table or desk - or even while holding the phone during use . I would then give it 5 stars.Let 's face it , unless you are buying this just to change the appearance of the phone , it is supposed to provide protection for your expensive device . Why would any manufacturer make a case that could actually help you drop your phone.After I removed this case from my phone , I felt that the naked phone actually had more grip than with the case.The Spigen & # 34 ; BOUNCE & # 34 ; or Otterbox & # 34 ; Commuter & # 34 ; are both much better cases if you want something that feels secure and grippy in your hand.Because a case is supposed to help protect your phone , not help you drop and damage your device , I can only give the Slim Armor Case 2 stars .

Amazon has intermingled the reviews for S-view and non S-view versions , so make sure the review you read applies to the case you want to buy ! I was concerned about reports of problems using these cases that may or may not be associated with the kit kat update . My phone is not yet on kit kat . I absolutely loved the similar Spigen case for my Galaxy S4 , so I went ahead and bought one of these , ordering it ahead of time so it would be on hand when I became eligible for a subsidized phone upgrade ! Just like the S4 case , this one looks to give reasonably good protection to the phone . To get better protection than this , you 'd have to go with the Otterbox Defender or a similar massively bulky case . Even this case adds a small amount onto both sides of every dimension . I still can fit it into my front jeans pocket for easy carrying , but it is n't as instinctive to slide it in as it was on smaller phones . The soft black has a soft , fairly grippy feel that makes my grip on the phone feel good . This is an excellent choice , not quite as good as the coating on the Seidio cases I 've used , but very usable . I handled a white Spigen case for the S4 that had a much slicker feel , and would n't have made me comfortable for fear I 'd drop it , I assume that the white Note 3 case is the same more slippery material.To my relief , when I removed the back cover of my phone and inserted it into the case , it worked perfectly . None of the reported problems . The next morning , I was disturbed to find that the auto-on and auto-off features of the case were now NOT working ! I took the phone out and reinserted it into the case , and everything was fine . I 'm hoping that is the end of the matter , but uncertainty makes me give the case four stars rather than five . If I go for a few weeks without more trouble , I 'll try to remember to come back here and upgrade my rating to five stars.ADDED LATER : unfortunately , I had two more failures of the S-View feature to work within 24 hours . Removing and replacing the phone in the case seemed to fix the problem , but this is unacceptable . I lost confidence in the place and have asked for a refund . Back to Amazon it will go .

Here is a report on what those were , what other uses I discovered , and how Glass fared in regard to each use.A better action video camera ? I had high hopes for Google Glass to be a replacement for my $ 50 bullet camera with better battery life , better image quality ( because of the wide-angle lense ) and better operability ( because I see what it records and can pause it etc ) .The verdict : Glass fails in this category . The battery life is even shorter ( 30 minutes tops with a full battery right off the charger ) . I can wear it under my aero-helmet , but not without feeling pressure . This is a no-go on even the shortest bike rides or runs . The low-light capability is not great , either , and on my night runs with a head light there is not much to see on the resulting video.It does not fit under or over ski goggles , and the clear or active shades do not replace goggles ( too small and too much draft that will tear up eyes at higher speeds ) .An in-vehicle or dashboard camera ? A camera that reliably and continuously records what happens around me when I drive would be great . Glass is promising , because it captures my field of view , including the rear view mirror , but it is not reliable and can not record continuously . When plugged in , the battery life would be no issue , but there is currently no app that records continuously ( and overwrites earlier clips when memory runs out ) . Also , the display is always on when it records video , which is bothersome at night.With a little bit of practice it is possible to wake up Glass and get into video recording mode in a matter of a few seconds , but that is not fast enough in unexpected situations.My verdict : I think that the device has potential in this category with the right software . Currently it is limited.A better run/ride tracker ? I saw that Strava has Glass apps even before I placed my Glass order , and I uploaded my entire workout history from Garmin to Strava in anticipation of using their apps with Glass.The verdict : Glass fails in this category , but my reasoning requires explanation , because admittedly this is the fault of my Nexus 5 and not so much the fault of Glass . Glass relies on the GPS sensor of the phone , and the Strava app only works when the phone is paired . Unfortunately my Nexus 5s GPS sensor data appears to be very inaccurate . When I started a `` Run '' on Strava while walking the dog , it placed me some 50 yards away from the road that I was on . I will continue to depend on the good old Garmin 305 in the coming years.In addition to issue with GPS accuracy , I do n't take Glass on runs because I sweat a lot from the head and both the power button and the bone-conduction speaker would be exposed and allow sweat ( or rain water ! ) to enter the device.A better headset ? A resounding no here . The bone conduction speaker vibrates and tickles behind my ear . Having longer conversations on Glass is uncomfortable . The sound quality is moderate at best , and many times there is some kind of mechanical obstruction that causes strong distortions , to a point where I can not understand the other party . I keep my Glass clean and protected , so I am not sure what causes the distortion . Maybe a tiny dust particle is all it takes.The ear bud speaker that is now included with Glass is too cumbersome to deal with for me . Glass is already bulky and in the way when you take if off because you ca n't simply fold it and put it in your shirt pocket . Now having something dangling on a USB cord attached to Glass is a non-starter . I have not even taken the ear bud out of the box yet.A hands-free smart phone controller ? Being able to control important features of your phone without actually having to look at it or even hold in your hand is a compelling feature . If you use Gmail and Hangouts exclusively , you are being well-served by Glass . You will be alerted by and can read instant messages . and respond to and write instant messages and emails by using the voice recognition that works pretty reliably for me.I do n't seem to be able to create emails from scratch , only instant messages to one of up to 10 contacts . I do see emails in my Gmail inbox , though . They appear as a new slide in the timeline and I can respond to them without ever touching Glass . This is pretty cool.The verdict : Unfortunately , I use neither Gmail nor Hangouts , and I frankly do n't get Hangouts . I can not access emails on my company 's Exchange server or my personal IMAP service from Glass , and while I have over 1,000 contacts on my phone , I only see 14 contacts on Glass . This pretty much renders Glass useless as a communication device.A better navigation device ? I really like the way navigation works . I have one car with a built-in navigation system and will not use Glass there - it certainly does not compete with the Mercedes Comand System . In my other car I do not have a navigation system at all , and previously I had to meddle with the phone when I needed directions . This works so much better on Glass.My verdict : Navigation is definitely a compelling use of the product , in the car as well as on the bike or on foot ( even though Google Maps lacks trail data ) . Based on some recent incidents that made national headlines , it appears that there is currently doubt among law enforcement officers whether using Glass while driving is legal and safe . I can attest that it can be surprising and distracting when Glass comes to live in full brightness during a night drive to alert you of an upcoming turn , but I do n't find it all that different from having a GPS device in the car that is on all the time.A better music streaming device ? With access to Google Music and completely hands-free operation through voice-activated searches , Glass offers yet another compelling use.My verdict : Exciting possibilities , but currently we have to compromise on either poor audio quality or complicated handling/wiring of ear buds . The mono ear bud that comes with Glass is , well , mono only ; stereo ear buds are available for an extra $ 85 , and my ears are n't made for ear bud-type headphones anyway . They tend to hurt and fall out , and the same is true for the ear bud that came with Glass . Voice search appears to be mostly broken . I have close to 20,000 songs on Google Music and searches only randomly find stuff . Is it possible that the songs have to reside in the phone 's cache for this to work ? Overall , I am somewhat indifferent about Glass ' current usefulness as a music streaming device.Other uses ? Glassware can be installed from the phone or the computer . The current selection of applications that work with Glass is limited ( I just counted 35 ) , which I find surprising , given how long Glass has been available to the development community already.My verdict : The speed of adoption among application developers seems to be slow and the number of available applications is small . I am confident that this will change . Still , no more than a null-vote on other uses at this time.A mature and well-tested device ? I run into odd and unexpected situations with Glass almost daily that require some tinkering to figure out . Examples ? *The on-head detection is flakey and sometimes shuts off Glass unexpectedly . I figured this out myself and the chatter on the Explorer forums confirmed my diagnosis . I just disabled this feature entirely . *The `` Ok Glass '' command stopped working on the 3rd day . I had to do a factory reset to get it back . *When I did a factory reset , it took several attempts and an uninstall of the MyGlass app on the Nexus 5 before I was able to pair them again . Glass would just not get into pairing mode . *Currently , phone calls or navigation do n't work while on a Wifi connection , even though I am paired and connected with the Nexus 5 . There is no way to `` disable '' the wireless connection temporarily . You have to make Glass `` Forget '' the connection to make a call and then recreate it . The phone reports the Bluetooth profile `` Phone Audio '' , not `` Headset '' as one would expect . *I am perpetually confused by what contacts I get to see on Glass . I understand that I can add up to 10 contacts from my phone that will show up on Glass as separate slides . So far I added 5 contacts . When I want to make a phone call , I am presented with 14 contact choices , though , the same people that appear in my Hangouts on Google . With half of them I have had no contact in years and I do n't have the slightest idea how they ended up there.My overall verdict : The head-mounted display and its possibilities are exciting and an indication that this technology will become pervasive in the very near future . But Glass appears to still be an experimental device that does not excel in any particular discipline , comes with a high price tag , and that non-techie consumers will struggle with . The short battery life severely limits its practical use and spoils the fun.I no longer keep my Glass charged and use it maybe once a month . It still works as a conversation-starter and that 's pretty much the only thing I use it for ."}, "25327": {"id": "25326", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I can definitely say that I do not like this case .

I have bluetooth speakers that cost less than half as much that sound better than this . I also have speakers that cost about the same that sound much better ( admittedly larger in size ) .

Packaging made it look like a super fantastic mini-speaker , and upon inspection it seemed like it would be ! - I thought it was silly to allow for the three different interchangeable silicon bands , until I quickly changed mine out for black and appreciated the option.- Bluetooth setup was easy and fast for both my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 . I 've used other Bluetooth devices that once you 've connected one device , is like pulling teeth trying to pair with another one . The TUNZBK-T paired easily . You can pair it with up to 8 different devices ! And I did n't know this , it 's on their website , but you can get two of these things and connect them with an audio cable to boost your sound -- not something I need , but thought that was really cool.- Sound is really good for your basic needs . I have basic needs , so this works great . Oddly , the internal start up volume is way louder than the bluetooth volume coming from your phone or iPad . Curiously strange . UPDATE : Sound is decent , for movies the sound seems a bit weak.- Size and style are a big plus , you can really port this around town with little space . It 's also a battery charger . As well , it did n't seem to take long to charge.- Buttons could do better to be backlit . They 're difficult to find in a dim-lit room , but they 're tactile and feel like brail so you know you 've found one by touch , but which one ? After a time it 's easy to memorize , there 's only 4 buttons.- Battery life indicator is kind of cool . Touch Bluetooth and Phone at the same time and a loud voice comes on to tell you the level.- Turn it on and it pairs instantly.Okay ... now for the reason I 'm rating this 2 stars ; START UP . Let 's talk about this for a minute : What idiot thought THAT was a good idea ? Seriously . I kind of imagine some college kids created this speaker and one of them came up with that obnoxious-pulsing-loud startup sound and declared , `` Dude ! This is so coooooool . '' It gives me a headache every time I hear it , and my 4 1/2 year old said it hurt his head and scared him . It 's troublesome because if I want to turn this on and use it , I ca n't do so quietly -- do n't use this in your office , or when you 're kids are sleeping . I looked all over and could n't find where you can turn this feature off , or lower it . As it is , when you turn the device on the speaker does this loopy sound from low to high volume with an annoying kick at the end . When you turn it off it does the opposite . Every time you connect your device a very loud female voice comes on to tell you , `` PLAYING MODE ACTIVATED . '' When you pair it , she says , `` CONNECTED . '' Was their a reason we needed this at the highest volume setting ? And sometimes , I do n't know why , it beeps loudly -- like when it was on and just sat there unused for a couple minutes . A reminder to not fall asleep with it on , or do n't dare `` Walk away from me . I 'll scream at you to come back . `` If it were n't for this problem , I would have rated this device 5 stars . As it is , I do n't recommend it . I think it should go for around forty bucks with a cautionary clause.So , Tylt , if you 're reading this , you need to fix this feature . Thanks ."}, "25343": {"id": "25342", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "First off , let me say this : I can put my bare Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , with either an after market charging coil in the original back , or the genuine Samsung charging back on the VU wireless charger and it will work flawlessly.HOWEVER , if I put ANY type of folio case on the phone , with EITHER back , I have problems.It seems that every folio case I try , and I have tried 4 from 4 different manufacturers , is too thick and keeps the phone 's charging circuits just a tiny bit too far away from the VU 's charging coils . One of the cases is so thin that I am not even sure that it offers any protection , but it , too , is too thick . About 3.32mm , as measured by my digital caliper.The symptoms are really obvious : Put the phone , with any of my four cases on the VU .

Lack of design function , too much form consideration.My ideal battery pack is as follows:1 ) Lightweight2 ) Economically priced3 ) Small footprintIt 's a support product for your phone . Function should be way over form for this . If you want to look at something pretty , get a nicer phone or tablet.Anything additional addon or design to the battery back is impractical . It serves more of a distraction than being useful . As consumers , we will end up paying more to have these `` features '' that we do not need.Features ( 1/10 ) : We want functional features on our products especially a support product for battery , not gimmicky features.The Shake to Wake function serves more a gimmick than any practical useFirstly so call shake requires a considerable force . Not many people will be willing to throw their arms frantically to get this awake . Can get this slipped out from your hand and there goes your battery.Since the shake function is gimmicky and serves zero practically , it 's simple to say we are paying more money for useless feature while having motors inside to make the battery pack weight more.Performance ( 7/10 ) : Performance is less at what a regular external battery does.There 's a simple math formula to calculate power conversion.In my one week of trial , I 'm able to get 2.2 recharge on my Galaxy S3 which is 2100mAh . This means in actual fact this is 4620mAh after efficiency conversionThe Wh claimed here is 9A*3.7V=33.3Wh33Wh/5V ( 5V from USB ) = 6.6A*1000=6600mAh is the expected Wh without circuit board inefficiency for a 9000mAh battery pack4650mAh ( from actual use ) / 6600mAH = 0.7045 equals to 70.45 % power conversion efficiency through their circuit board . Average total energy conversion rate ( TECR ) on average circuit board is rated at 80-85 % from reputable brands.This equals to around 10-15 % less energy efficient than your typical reputable brand with the same battery they are using.3 problems can cause issue:1 ) cheap battery used2 ) cheap board design causing inefficiency3 ) cheap material used on circuit board reducing TECRNowadays , consumers are very easy to get fooled by having some good battery cells used and stick in one or two mediocre ones . It allows manufacturer to earn some margin on selling mediocre battery packsCheap board design occurs when manufacturer uses poorly made board or power inefficient chips . This caused lose of energy and greatly reduce TECR.The 10-15 % energy lost can be a little bit of the 3 problems.Price ( 2/10 ) : Price for this battery pack is not cheap consider the above performance result . At literally 25 % more than other comparable brands , this manufacturer is making a huge margin and justify adding more cost by:1 ) putting gimmick features on board2 ) possibly using mediocre battery cells3 ) possibly using cheap material or poor board designThere are cheaper alternatives out there with higher efficiency . With more choices out there , it 's hard to find reason to pay this much for a battery packDesign ( 3/10 ) : The overall aesthetic of the battery is nice to look but not entirely practical . People need to remember that for backup battery pack , function is far more important than how it looks . Concept of design requires a good balance between function and form with polarized products such as a backup battery pack , it requires much more function over form.I say this because you will put this device in your pouch and will not take this out at rare occasions . When you are recharging the battery pack you will most likely leave it in the pouch provided . If you are looking for something with better form , go get a better looking phone that this device supports.In the case where you will hold this with your phone or tablet , the rounded surface leaves your phone or tablet unstably positioned . As a product of support , it 's simple to say this is not struturally supportive at all.Many people such as myself prefer not to use the pouch included as that traps heat and as your chemistry teacher will say , heat is a big no-no for batteries . When it is out of the bag , the back battery charger serves absolutely no purpose except to look good on its own.That itself is a design failure and lack of consideration to user experience.Conclusion ( 2/10 ) Let me put it this way . In this economy we probably want something more practical , more functional . Some aesthetic is great on some products but as a support product , this has too much glitter and glamour but none of the practical stuff you really need . It 's a support device for your phone and it is the phone where the glitter and glamour should be . However , it 's not acting like a support device at all with its subpar performance and its rounded surface.I 'll run this in another week and hope at least the performance improves . If it does n't , I 'm sending this back for something that serves more purpose .

Tried listening to music on my iPhone , and even when placed in a supposedly-amplifying shallow bowl , I still could n't hear it over the sound of the whirlpool jets.When I saw this waterproof Bluetooth wireless speaker , I thought my wish had been granted . Ordered it , charged the thing up and synced it with my iPhone without a problem . That first night I listened to an hour of the Brandenburg Concertos and thought I was in heaven . As I finished bathing , I drained the tub and started getting out , at which point my foot knocked this thing into the tub ... at which point I realized the suction cup does n't work very well . Not a problem , I figured , I 'll just have to move the thing further from the edge of the tub in the future.Well , the next night I tried to use this speaker again and it did n't work . It would n't even go on ! Maybe the battery only lasts an hour or so ? I took it back to the laptop ( there 's no wall charger , just USB ) and tried charging it . Nope . It would n't charge . It would n't even turn on . For all intents and purposes , it had turned into a round , pink brick.Now , there was LESS than 1 inch of water when I 'd knocked it into the tub , and it had landed suction-cup side down , so the speaker itself never even got wet . It was less than an 18-inch fall ( broken by that & # 60 ; 1 inch of water , at that ) , so it was n't a hard impact that would 've dislodged well-made electronics . I 'd even immediately retrieved it and dried the thing off , so it had n't sat in water . In other words : there is NO REASON FOR IT TO STOP WORKING , and yet it did . After just one use.As far as I 'm concerned , if you 're going to advertise something as waterproof , it better be able to handle such little water , and certainly such a split-second exposure to it . If you 're going to put a suction cup on it , that suction cup better work .

There are studies of human motion that back this up . I am one such person because I think the foot was designed , either by evolution or divine being , to work properly as is . Artificially holding the arch up only serves to weaken the muscles the foot was designed with causing more foot pain and the need for more arch support .

It was only after about 5 seconds of standing in these that the foot pain started.I tried to endure but I didn & # 8217 ; t get past the 3 minute mark with these shoes on and walking around the house . They were so painful with the arch bump poking the muscles and tendons of my arch ( mine are built up and strong from proper running and exercise ) and all my weight was placed on the outsides of my feet.For Reebok shoes I was surprised that they were also a little narrow especially in the toe box . Not too narrow for my foot but just less roomy than real running shoes . Again healthy feet need the toes to spread when running because that is where the push off comes from and the toes spread to & # 8220 ; dig in & # 8221 ; while pushing the body forward.These shoes are not for runners or those with strong feet muscles.For people that insist on high arch support and the toes being kept more stationary this shoe would be a good choice .

Her weight had a devastating effect on her body and at this point , she knew she had to do something . After her Mother discovers the H2O diet , Tiffany does a little research and decides to give it a try . She takes us along with her on the five month journey , month by month .

( By the way , this book is well worth paying for ! ) She doesn & # 8217 ; t say what she ate while losing all that weight , but I gather she ate pretty much the Standard American Diet , but & # 8220 ; watered down & # 8221 ; ( literally ) with all that water . She plainly wouldn & # 8217 ; t be able to eat as much , but I do know from years past that drinking a lot of water in order to eat less ( of the Standard American Diet ) left me feeling a lot of hunger . For me , any & # 8216 ; diet & # 8217 ; I have ever used - whether it is vegan or Paleo - requires I eat plenty of vegetables in order to restrain my hunger - even with water . But , then I never have drank the level of water she is speaking of , at least not around mealtimes or with meals.I grew up with the belief that a person should n't drink fluids during a meal because it diluted the digestive juices . But , one of Dr. Oz shows encouraged drinking fluids with meals because otherwise the stomach has a hard time getting the nutrients out of such a thick mass of food . So , Dr. Oz is confirming just what this author spoke of.From now on I will be drinking a lot more water with and around meal-times . Up to this time I have been trying to limit my water consumption during meals to & # 8217 ; no more than 8 ounces & # 8217 ; .I have noticed before that at times when I am into drinking a lot of water , that the weight seems to fall off even if I 'm not really behaving myself perfectly with food . And , even when I am eating well , that oftentimes the weight does n't come off so well when I & # 8216 ; m not drinking much water . I was aware of this , but it never really sunk in until I read this book . From here on out I will be making sure to drink my water ! I am going to type out the water schedule and amounts she used , and use it as a guideline to get me drinking more water all through the day .

On the other hand the DRMC The Dark Rebels Motorcycle Club was run by fear there was no brotherhood and their moral code did n't exist , and this had become her existence since she had been kidnapped two years before.I can not imagine what Rose went through in those two years we are given bits and pieces and we see what is happening now and I have to admit there were times when I just wanted to put the book down because of what was happening , how some body can go through that and come out the other side is amazing , but Rose although she is a strong character is just about had it when somebody comes into her life.We do n't meet Josh until well into the book but although no angel he is the sole surviving member of the MC that Rose had grown up in and he has a mission in life , he lives by that strong moral code and although the last member he strives to uphold the flag even if he can not wear the colours because to do so would mean instant death.When the two of them meet there is instant attraction , memories of better times and hope for the future .

The lead up to the end is also as good as the other two Traveler 's Gate books too ."}, "26180": {"id": "26179", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "& # 8220 ; City of Light & # 8221 ; is the third book in Will Wight & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; Travelers Gate & # 8221 ; series . It appears that this may be the conclusion of the trilogy , although Wight does mention after the book that he may revisit The Traveler & # 8217 ; s Gate universe at some point down the road . In this third installment , The incarnations are free and one of them ( someone thought dead from the last book ) comes back into play and tries to organize all of the incarnations into a ruling power underneath his authority . Returning are our three central characters : Alin , Simon , and Leah . Leah is queen now after the death of her father and is trying to come to terms with her new position and the implications thereof . Simon has continued to train in the House of Blades and stands ready to fight the incarnations . Since incarnating in the last book , Alin has taken control of his territory and is struggling to deal with the conflicting powers that now rage within him.I enjoyed this third book , as I did the previous two . I absolutely believe that Will Wight is a talented author and I look forward to reading whatever he turns out next . To be fair , I must say that even though I enjoyed the book and the series , I am somewhat disappointed now that I & # 8217 ; ve read its conclusion . Not disappointed in what & # 8217 ; s in the book & # 8211 ; but rather disappointed in what is not . The story should have been much larger than what & # 8217 ; s contained in these three books . Alin & # 8217 ; s character is mostly abandoned for this third episode , appearing at the beginning and then returning at the very end to serve his purpose . The worldview and inner struggles of an incarnation of almost limitless power could have been a terrifically interesting side story in the book , but is instead completely ignored . The dynamic of Leah versus her incarnated father could have been a heart wrenching dynamic in the story and instead is very underplayed . But most disappointing in my opinion is Simon & # 8217 ; s story arc . He is without a doubt the heart of the trilogy and far and away the most interesting of the characters . Well , that may not be true . His combined story is the most interesting & # 8211 ; not necessarily just him . I was completely intrigued with the house of Valinhall . What lies in the rest of the secret rooms of the house ? With Simon as the & # 8220 ; founder & # 8217 ; s heir & # 8221 ; , who & # 8217 ; s the real authority in the house now & # 8211 ; Simon or the Nye ? Will Simon be able to retrieve all of the dragon & # 8217 ; s fangs ? What about the new masks that were made & # 8211 ; that supposedly held the power of the house but didn & # 8217 ; t have all of the negative side effects ? I could list a dozen more questions I & # 8217 ; d like answers to , but you get the point . It seems to me that there is quite a bit more to be told regarding Simon and his territory and I certainly hope that Wight will make the time to revisit this world he & # 8217 ; s created & # 8211 ; and hopefully sooner rather than later.Those things aside , I loved the book and look forward to reading Wight in the future .

Filled with adventure , romance , hot sensual love scenes , an awesome heroine with an amazing sense of humor who is not afraid to follow her gut feelings , to one of the most hunky , funny heroes I could not get enough of this story.Dyre has decided to follow his own dream of becoming a hero and deviating from his mercenary heritage . This has driven his family so crazy they have pretty much disowned him.Our hero embarks on a quest to fulfill his destiny , only things does n't go exactly as planned . Basically causing more destruction and calamity rather than saving the day , Dyre is a little befuddle as to why those he has `` rescued '' seem so anxious to be rid of him . Hysterically Dyre somehow interprets their less than thrilled reactions as positive and wonderful . Even the man-eating plants he has been gifted with `` must '' have been given to him to show how `` only one as brave as he is could handle them . `` Obviously unaware of the saying `` no good deed goes unpunished '' , Dyre continues his mission across the universe , when he hears if a maiden in distress about to be sacrificed to a dangerous beast . Betty , our heroine , has been plotting to steal treasures in the lair of this beast when she is `` rescued '' by a purple warrior who has no clue he is spoiling her plans.Betty decides to stick with the hot purple hunk , despite her impression that he is somewhat lacking in the common sense department . After all there is something cute about the bug guy , even if occasionally turns out she is the one doing the rescuing.Betty makes a great heroine and match for Dyre , who is in need of a damsel in distress . Ever one to ignore advice and safety precautions , trouble and danger follow her . She is spunky , fearless , rebellious and to her surprise starts to find herself attracted to the quirky purple hunk . Besides , Betty is curious as to what all the big deal is about this `` mating `` business.The banter and dialogue between the two was hilarious , especially since they were both on such different wavelengths without even knowing it.Dyre finds he is becoming more and more drawn to the '' small `` barbarian '' who draws out his need to protect and even processes . Their attraction and romance grows throughout all the chaos.Their relationship becomes stronger with the many ( often comical ) obstacles and situations they encounter out in space , as well as dealing with his annoying interfering parents . Hot sexy love scenes seal the deal.Defining and redefining his own description of what a hero is , Dyre nevertheless is an extremely skilled and effective warrior . The authors amazing talent for humorous writing excelled with Dyre turning all his heroic attempts into success stories despite serious mishaps . I give the heroine so much credit for understanding his mojo and the wit she needed to go along with it all.A few new characters are introduced in this book . Dyre 's parents are so funny as the distraught parents of their mercenary pirate son going all good hero , and Betty 's awesome kickass , overprotective killer bird-like alien sister/copilot.Eve Langlais is not only an amazing sci-fy , adventure , romance author but quite the comedic wit .

Thus , the elderly residents of & # 8220 ; Rest View & # 8221 ; feel forlorn , forgotten , and crushed under the stifling sameness of the bland meals and regimented routine.Prizewinning author Robert K. Swisher , Jr. has created a colorful and amusing palette of characters : Harold , the loveable retard with the mind of a six year old and heart full of love and hope ; Nurse Steal , for whom the residents take the place of a family ; Bertha , age 93 , whose mind has failed to the point where she thinks her teddy bear is her baby ; George and Henry , two grumpy old men who squabble over their daily checkers game ; Mr. Fisk and his buddies , who long to get a Playboy magazine and who race to see who can escape the farthest into the parking lot before the orderlies catch them ; Martha , the brains of the outfit who hatches up a scheme to stage a rebellion ; the uber-religious Grace Brethren , who quotes the Bible and refuses to join in the fun ; and several other equally amusing and loveable old folks.In preparing the characters for their greatest challenge , Author Swisher sprinkles pearls of wisdom throughout his residents dialog . & # 8220 ; We just hang on from day to day and before long we no longer look to the future for anything but another day . We plod along and ignore everything that is going on around us , as if by ignoring , all the bad will go away. & # 8221 ; Nurse Steal says , & # 8220 ; A good and caring God would not curse anybody to time eternal in hell .

Dreams we know that will never be fulfilled , dreams that in truth only take us farther and farther away from the truth. & # 8221 ; Harold , the loveable simpleton , has a great personal secret . He believes that he can transform into a bird and fly . In time , a few of the residents begin to believe it & # 8217 ; s true , and so they prevail upon Harold to hold flying classes . The men , especially , begin to have a spark of hope , that flying will be a means of escape from their perceived captivity.Martha Dearheart , sensing the loss of hope among her friends , calls a meeting for the purpose of developing a list of their demands for change . Martha thinks , & # 8220 ; Everyone looks lost & # 8211 ; lost in a world where no dreams for the future can exist . Wishing never did anybody any good , only action makes change. & # 8221 ; I am sure most people never think about living in a rest home until they are in one . Somehow people have forgotten life is love and hope and not fear and control. & # 8221 ; The resulting list of demands are simple enough : more variety in their meals , a birdbath , a small garden , real plants in the day room , the privilege of going outside without a nurse , and -- the most outrageous -- flying classes taught by Harold . Thus , the stage is set for conflict and resolution . What happens to their demands . Will the residents learn to hope and dream ? Will they escape their mundane existence ? Will they learn to fly ?

It was my first book written by Kate Donovan and unfortunately , I & # 8217 ; m quite disappointed . Let me explain why.First , while the plot itself is quite easy and classic when it comes to that kind of story , it & # 8217 ; s not the thing that bothered me . The plots and sub-plots are quite all over the place , sometimes exploding in all and every direction to the point that it becomes more & # 8216 ; difficult & # 8217 ; to follow or at least enjoy the adventure . It & # 8217 ; s a damn shame because it could have been really amazing . To be honest , I even think some parts weren & # 8217 ; t believable and even contradict other parts in the story.For example , Erica bothered me to no end . She was always changing her mind to the point that it wasn & # 8217 ; t even logical . I mean , I don & # 8217 ; t mind at all when a character is having trouble settling her mind and when she & # 8217 ; s fighting with herself when it comes to a guy because it & # 8217 ; s often thrilling to read about , but here it & # 8217 ; s not how it felt . In fact , I couldn & # 8217 ; t feel her at all most of the time . It & # 8217 ; s a big problem when it & # 8217 ; s the main character.Johnny is a good enough male lead character even if I couldn & # 8217 ; t see the real chemistry for a good part of the book . I missed it completely in fact . The author had to point it out through both characters & # 8217 ; words for it to be understandable , which is , once again , a real issue to me . Johnny won & # 8217 ; t leave any mark in my mind , I think.I really like the secondary characters like Bam and Decker . These two were awesome to read about , and I & # 8217 ; d love to read a book centered on them to better see their friendship and how silly Bam is and how sweet Decker is . The best kind of mix . Hopefully the author will write them books and maybe I & # 8217 ; ll enjoy it more if the characters are better characterized and if the plot is better polished or at least better built.Also , now that I think about it , I miss a higher stake in this book . Since the chemistry between Johnny and Erica isn & # 8217 ; t that obvious most of the time , a higher stake would have helped me to get into the story and then fear for the characters . It & # 8217 ; s just an idea , because I truly think that there & # 8217 ; s material for a good book , but it missed the mark for me . I always feel bad when it happens , almost as if I & # 8217 ; m the one who failed a book and not the other way around . I & # 8217 ; m weird , I know.So , obviously , I didn & # 8217 ; t like reading this book .

I get the whole sex drugs and rock and roll but for me unless it is done right ( and trust me there is a way ) cheating is a no no . You have Grey that loves Quinn ( stylist for both bands ) , they love each other but Willow from TP wants Grey and will stop at nothing to get him no matter that she likes Quinn . She thinks that Quinn is a sweet girl but Grey is hers and will take him from her.That was all she wrote . I was trying to give it a chance but for me Willow was acting like a trashy ho . I was done . That alone for me is what stopped it.Oh yeah , but Grey wants Willow too but is & # 8220 ; really & # 8221 ; trying to not let things happen even though he dry humps Willow on their tour bus and blows his load but & # 8220 ; he does n't want to hurt Quinn & # 8221 ; Give me a freaking break.Things might have turned around at some point because I know Landon ( Greys brother ) is in love with Quinn and has been forever and Quinn admits that she sees the looks that Willow and Grey give each other.I get that this is a story , its make believe but I want to be able to believe it and want to continue reading it.There was a lot of point of views going around that at times I was confused on who was talking and who they were talking too . If there was a break between chapters for me I think that would have been better.I liked the story line , who doesnt love a story about bands that tour together . I get the whole sexual tension and at times it was very hot but at the end of the day it just was n't for me .

Below is the original review.I downloaded the Allergy Friendly Eats : A Collection of The Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe 's Most Popular Gluten-Free & Allergy Friendly Recipes cookbook by authors Rita Sturzbecher and John Apostolovic and was a bit disappointed to find the authors included external links to their website to get recipes . I do believe if I pay for a cookbook it should contain all the recipes needed to prepare a dish . I should not have to depend on Internet access to complete a recipe . Also , their cookbook lacks an interactive table of contents making it a bit more difficult to find the recipes you would like to prepare.Also , some of the recipes call for proprietary ingredients such as Little Aussie GF Flour.I do like how the authors stated all the recipes are gluten free and are free of the top 10 allergens unless otherwise noted . You will read an index of recipes and there are notations stating if there is a possible allergy ingredient used to prepare the recipe . You will find numerous color photos showing completed recipes.Some of the recipes you will find in their cookbook include : Spinach Quiche with the notation `` Contains dairy . '' This recipe uses Little Aussie GF Flour and includes an external link for the pie crust recipe needed to make the quiche.Mini Chorizo French Toast ( You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF buns to complete the recipe ) .Creamy Rice PuddingAlmond Tea Cake ( Recipe says contains the notation `` Contains eggs and almonds . '' ( You will need to purchase the Little Aussie GF flour to complete the recipe ) .Dairy-Free Garlic `` Butter '' Australian Lamb Pie ( You will need to buy and pick up the pie crust from the Little Aussie Bakery or make the pie crust by finding their recipe online using an external link ) .Ox Blood Chocolate Cake with the notation `` Contains eggs .

There is a link to the Little Aussie Bakery & Cafe to purchase the flour ) .As you can see this cookbook reads more like an advert than a true stand alone cookbook .

However , to be fair : I 'm a writer and the word & # 34 ; writing & # 34 ; does n't appear anywhere on the book cover . My expectations may have been too high.This book does share some good tips about publishing . I 'd read most of them in others ' reports and courses , but Brian distilled them down to their basic ( perhaps lowest ) common denominators . Those can be useful if you 're a busy author and just need some pointers.However , the rest of this book ... ? No . Too many run-on sentences made this book difficult to read . ( I actually counted the words in one sentence , and it was 46 words long . Really . ) Other sections were simply confusing . I had to re-read them multiple times to figure them out . Even then , I was n't always sure what Mr. Johnson was trying to say.So , I was n't happy with this book by the 20 % point . I did n't like the bold-typed first letter in each paragraph , either . It seemed like very odd formatting.Then there was Mr. Johnson 's heavy emphasis on keywords . His advice might sell niche research software , but I do n't think it 's the smartest way to predict book success . When you 're planning to write a book , by-the-numbers approaches wo n't give you the entire story . ( No pun intended . ) My shoulders really sagged in disappointment when I reached the section where he recommended outsourcing book content . I wo n't say it 's a complete blight on the indie publishing field , but it 's close.Hiring someone who writes articles for $ 3 - $ 15 , to author your book for you ... ? Bad advice . ( Yes , I once worked for an article-writing service . Among professionals , that kind of writing is called & # 34 ; junk on paper. & # 34 ; Those $ 15 articles were n't our best efforts , and we only wrote them to pay the rent . Pride in our work ... ? No . We were grateful our names were n't on the finished products . ) Then again , outsourcing may explain things like the 46-word sentence in this book.All in all , I think this kind of book misleads nice , trusting people with dreams of being published someday . It sells them on a business model that 's more about making money than developing career skills as a writer/publisher.If you 're a veteran author who can sort the wheat from chaff to glean a few tips , you may find this book worthwhile at the 99-cent price.Otherwise , I ca n't recommend this book ."}, "26383": {"id": "26382", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Story was ok.I it was also roughly written .

When she decides to join the same gym as her brother , she meets Riker - the hot , muscly manwhore who wants to flex her glutes and pull her hamstrings ( I 'm stabbing blindly in the dark with these gym terms because I 'm as familiar with gyms as I am with social cues ) .As the story goes on , we get more details on Kaiya 's abuse by Kaleb . At first we 're left in the dark about who Kaleb is but with a brother named Kamden and her own name , it does n't take Stephen Hawking to see that there are some Kardashian-esque naming practices going on here and siblings with names beginning with K is officially a thing . Kaiya has been let down and abused by so many people - by her physical abuser , by her parents who have torn loyalties - that she deserves someone trustworthy and kind . And that 's where Ryker comes in . A man as stupid as his name , he 's the type of person who you wonder how he got this far in life without chewing off his own foot . He pervs on the young female gym clientele , he judges his overweight clients and has clearly lost his respect for others down the back of some slut 's sofa . Oh , you did n't like that I called a woman a slut as a pejorative ? Get used to it because that 's how Ryker sees the women he sleeps with - they 're sluts , whores , b ! tches . These words are tossed out so casually , but I got the feeling I was n't supposed to be as shocked and grossed-out as I was . Ryker got a boo-boo on his feelings a few years ago ( a whorish , slutty , b ! tch-c*nt was responsible , of course ) so now he uses women for sex and nothing more . This also means that he hates all women . Every one of them . So when he sees Kaiya , he 's shocked by how pure and unwhorish she is . Joy ! But it is n't that easy to entrap the princely prize that Ryker is . Even during their 'courtship ' , Ryker bangs his way around town , dodging whiny women who expect respect and basic courtesy . Stupid sluts - do n't they realise a woman hurt his feelings a few years ago ? As their 'romance ' unfolds , Kaiya has to deal with the prospect of her abuser being released , Kamden 's over protectiveness and her friend with benefits , Bryce . Here 's where Kaiya lost me . She and Ryker truly are soulmates because they see nothing wrong with treating people like crap . It 's clear that Bryce has feelings for Kaiya ( and it 's impossible to believe she does n't realise this ) but she continues to sleep with him whenever the mood strikes . Bryce is clearly a good guy . He worries about her and wants her to be safe , but Kaiya treats him like an irritant , despite having hauled her butt out of his bed only a few days prior . Who is raising these characters ? Does no one listen to Aretha Franklin anymore ? Having said that , it 's an entertaining book - I 'm just particularly sensitive when it comes to manners and people being mean . There are a few really worthy and valuable features in this book , however . Kaiya takes a lot of self-defence classes and they 're described in such a way that the reader can conceivably pick up a lot of tips . This never comes across as preachy or lecturing , rather it brings the reader deeper into the story - verifying Ryker 's ostensible 'good guyness ' . Along with that , there is a page on sexual assault resources and information at the back of the book . I ca n't stress how welcome this was .

In the beginning , you have a heroine who is naive , makes stupid choices , and recognizes that about herself , and knows she needs to grow and make better choices in the future . So far , I liked it . Characters can be stupid at parts , that is fine by me ; it makes characters likable , sometimes . She runs , and I can see why she would , and then meets the heroes . All is fine . I liked that Daniel was angry at first , thinking she was a drunk driver , and I appreciated how that transpired . When the spanking thing gets introduced , I was a little unsure about it , but the author had hinted at it , and Danny and Trevor seem to give her time to acclimate to the idea , and once she shows interest , they proceed . Out of my comfort zone , but ultimately , not bad , though I skipped over the spanking scenes after a while .

There are a few lame attempts to make him out to be a & # 8220 ; good & # 8221 ; guy , but then he squashes that with his complete lack of remorse for his past deeds .

You do n't see him in the process of degenerating into his madness . You see him when he 's fully 'round the bend , so the rather clueless Simon from previous films is not here and I do miss him . He does play the character well though he takes a time out to up the entertainment level with his lip-synch to a gangster rap tune . It 's a lot of fun but a noticeable departure from the proceedings . There is also a medium share of farce and physical humor which he handles well .

My favorite has always been the Shemp episodes and for whatever reasons I 'm unsure of , near impossible to find.On some occasions , certain networks show the Three Stooges rather randomly but they always been Curly episodes and a whole lot of repeated episodes almost every time you watch it.Throughout the years I came across various dvds and partials of the Three Stooges , none of which features Shemp even if the cover has a picture of him . My main way of ever hoping to watch the show was to record it on vhs and hope that I can re-watch it sometime . I sometimes see Three Stooges collections at the movie stores , but it was very unclear how to complete such collection.So in comes this ultimate dvd collection . Let me say I was very skeptical at first . My thought were exactly , & # 34 ; No way this could be the complete ultimate collection that features every Curly , Shemp , and Joe films. & # 34 ; Sure enough it is , and I 'm very glad to have purchased this . I do n't know when this DVD was released or for how easy it is to access Shemp episodes . I 'm just glad to finally come across the dvds and am very glad I can watch it . I found many episodes I completely forgotten about including the one where Shemp was in a stolen box car and had a drunken vision of a bird . Other funny episodes include where Shemp had this fishbowl stuck on his head after attempting to get his inheritance money.To my surprise a lot of Three Stooges episodes are rehashes of other episodes but in various formats . To me the Three Stooges are the funniest but also some of Hollywood most tragic actors and certainly shows the evil and corruption of Hollywood . I know some writers of the shows actually committed suicide after going bankrupt . All the Stooges had broken bones and Curly and Shemp both suffered tragic , sudden deaths . As you all know Shemp came on the show after Curly and a lot of Shemp 's episodes are remakes of earlier Curly episodes . Even more surprising after Shemp died , they simply re-used a lot of his films for future versions until Joe came into the picture . All that is within this Ultimate Collection of Three Stooges . You also get some very nice missing episodes that are very rare . You get 3d glasses , which I have n't tried yet in fear of losing the glasses.Overall I am very happy to own this .

Yes , the DVD is for beginners , and beginners will definitely learn a lot from this program , but even those who already practice this style of Tai Chi will benefit from Dr. Yang 's years of experience and knowledge.The program begins with a short introduction chapter that shows Dr. Yang performing Tai Chi in a wooded area while a voice over , combined with subtitles , introduces the viewer with Tai Chi and its benefits . Next comes a chapter about Yang Tai Chi with Dr. Yang , at his retreat in a wooded area , talking about Yang Tai Chi , and explaining about this form . While Dr. Yang speaks English , there are subtitles throughout the entire DVD . After these preliminaries , there is a group demonstration with Dr. Yang and a number of his students performing the form.After this demonstration , Dr. Yang 's instruction begins . He goes through everything , teaching to the camera . It is like you are there with him . The only negative is you ca n't ask him questions or have him come and correct your form . This DVD really is the next best thing to being there . He teaches and allows you to view from different views and he points out common mistakes and provides tips throughout the program . At times he brings students out to demonstrate applications that are found within the form to allow the viewer to better understand the movements . After the instruction , Dr. Yang performs a demonstration of the form by himself . ( Subtitles across the bottom of the screen allow you to see which movement he is performing , and they are all numbered when teaching , and there is also an insert in the DVD package that lists all the movements by number and name . ) Next , there is a rear view of the form that you can follow along with performed by one of Dr. Yang 's students . ( Also with subtitles of the numbered movements . ) Finally , there is a conclusion where Dr. Yang provides additional information about the form , martial arts , history , and concluding comments . I have seen quite a few Tai Chi instructional DVDs and this is without a doubt the most detailed program I have viewed . It 's 293 minutes long and contains a wealth of instructional information.Obviously , learning live from a qualified instructor is always best . However , sometimes this is not possible , or sometimes you want additional instruction at home to compliment your class instruction .

There is no need to repeat previous comments , so I will just make the following comment : `` Believe what they say ! `` The only `` negative '' ( and not really a negative comment as much as a head-scratch moment ) that I could come up with is that while the DVD provides a great instructional tool for the beginner and a must-have resource for the experienced practitioner , first-timers should start with the Simplified 24 and 48 posture book and DVD , by Liang , Shou-Yu and Yang , Jwing-Ming ( also highly recommended publications ) . In 14 years of practice , I have yet to encounter a `` beginner '' group or student that is practicing a 113-posture form . The Standardized 24-posture routine is the most widely practice tai chi form in the world for good reason and should therefore be the first stepping stone for the beginner .

She ( Jessie Busley ) and her best friend ( Una O'Connor ) have turned the stately old place into a boarding house seemingly for the eccentric . In fact both these ladies are a couple of Irish-accented characters who quickly take to Bogie as if he were a long-lost son.It 's in this picture that we hear him say in resigned exasperation , `` Now I have TWO muddahs !

There 's also ex-vaudeville magician `` The Great Boldini '' ( Felix Bressart ) and his undying dream of making a comeback . Best of all is Ann Sheridan as the other old lady 's daughter . She 's a nightclub chanteuse who knows the truth about Bogart 's shady past , but is n't saying.. at least for now . Sheridan in her vocalist role does two songs that any Boomer who grew up watching Warner cartoons will instantly recognize : `` Angel in Disguise '' and `` The Gaucho Serenade .

Far from it , in fact ! I think Roger Moore was about on his way out when I was first forming memories . And I was n't a big fan back in the day , either , not until college when I started collecting the films on VHS.I 've been through the Bonds , though , and was there for each of Brosnan 's releases on video . Still not huge on Bond in the theater , though ... not even when they rebooted the series with Daniel Craig . Not after I fell in love with Casnio Royale and decided to become a fan ... not when Quantum came out , a movie I very much anticipated ... Skyfall : that was the turning point for me . IMAX the Wednesday night it was released ( 12:07am Thursday morning ) and the next night ( 12:07am Friday morning ) for the regular screen release . The wait , the anticipation , the past two Craig performances , the build up , the cast , the trailers ... I was finally hooked . And Bond did not disappoint.As one reviewer already said , the first 10 minutes are pretty epic . They went on to say the rest of the film was take-it-or-leave-it , which I wholly contest , but everyone is entitled to their opinion . I concur with the first part of that review , though , that the opening up to and including Adele 's haunting intro was , by far , the best opening to any James Bond film ever.Why do so many dislike the new Bond , both the man and the films ? I think it is the humanization of a very fictional caricature . We turned to Bond to provide us with some silliness and fun at the expense of our very real Cold War fears . Hot wars were still raging across the globe , but never fear , England and America ! James Bond is here to patriotize your day ! This was very necessary ... back then.Now , the world is more globalized , and technology that was once amusing and farcical is very real and tactile . As such , Bond became more human , more 'defictionalized ' in a world that is harder to scare anymore by the goofball antics of Odd-Job , Jaws , and Rosa Klebbs . Instead , real villains that we do n't ever see , covert and secret organizations that `` live and operate in the shadows , not on a map '' ( to paraphrase a quote from Dame Judi Dench 's very wonderful monologue in the courtroom scene ) . These are what scare us now ; terrorists , random acts of violence , enemies that we can not compartmentalize and clearly point out.This is the modern movie villain , so Bond has adjusted accordingly to be more modern in order to fight this threat . Instead of falling into the trap of scaring us with real-life horrors , though , the films have been keeping enough fiction ( science fiction , in some cases ) to ensure that we do n't take Bond 'too seriously , ' that there is still enough of the fiction left in him to be entertaining and not shocking . I think the recent films work beautifully on that level , and the pinnacle thus far , in my opinion , is Skyfall.I think there are enough reviews to give you the plot elements you 'll need to get by , along with the special editions included , of which there are plenty . It 's not the best Blu-ray I 've ever seen in my entire life as far as bonus content is concerned , but there is more than enough by most standards . Besides , I do n't want to distract myself too much from the content of the film itself.I will say , too , that they added some very fun homages to the 50 years of James Bond , including casting Finney as the gamekeeper . The car was an awesome touch , too . Will all Bond fans fall in love with this new breed of MI6 secret agent ? Probably not . If you 're one of the Connery/Moore hardcore fans , yeah , you probably wo n't dig Craig as much , which you already know from the prior two films.From an objective point of view , though , this is what you can expect : - high-octane action and stunts- lovely femme fatales and sultry scenes- beautiful cinematography of exotic locations- fast-paced plot that keeps moving , with very few pit stops along the way- classic , jovial , dry wit from so many different colorful characters- outstanding performances by the main cast and supporting playersCraig , Dench and Bardem absolutely shine on screen , and surprising performances are turned in as well by newcomers Fiennes , Harris and Whishaw . The script has been polished to a near perfect shine ( one would hope , given the amount of time we waited between films ) , and the interaction is flawless . The scenes are lovely and beautifully filmed , and the cinematography creates a palpable environment for the audience.If you enjoy action movies , if you 're a Bond fan or not , if you like suspenseful thrillers , then you have to give Skyfall a viewing . Perhaps you 'll fall in love with the legend as much as others have , perhaps you wo n't . But by itself , Skyfall stands alone as a work of art lovingly crafted by Mendes .

Craig brought new life into the character , making him a scrappy , visceral hero , and with his piercing gaze revealed a depth to the character I had never seen before.Whether it 's a response to the tough times we 've living in , or strictly a matter of creative direction , James Bond 2012 is no longer living a male fantasy . Sure , he still has the ability to seduce and bed beautiful women , but aside from that , things have gotten tough . In the beginning of `` Skyfall '' , Bond is accidently shot by his own team while on top of a moving train , where he falls hundreds of feet into a body of water . Thought dead , he takes the opportunity to disappear for a while and enjoy the anonymous life . It 's only when MI6 is attacked on their own turf and the results are so overwhelming that it makes the international news that Bond decides to reemerge.Upon his return , Bond is no longer in top form . Craig is far from the oldest actor to play the character , but his superiors and co-workers seem to think he 's too old to be continuing as a field agent .

M ( Judi Dench ) only clears him to return to action out of a mix of desperation and loyalty . 2012 's James Bond is no longer a superhero . He 's tough , stoic , and brave , but he 's no longer the alpha male - he 's the underdog.Bond goes about tracking down the man who both blew up MI6 's headquarters and is now revealing the identities of covert field agents ( guaranteeing their deaths . ) When he does come across Silva ( Javier Bardem ) , that 's when things get really interesting . In the case of `` Skyfall '' , not only is the hero a much more interesting character , but the villain is fascinating . A disgraced and destroyed former MI6 agent himself , the character seems to want nothing more than to destroy his former boss M by first destroying everything that means anything to her - her reputation , her co-workers , and her country.In the film 's final act , Bond takes M to `` Skyfall , '' the Scottish estate where he was born and raised . The most logistically safe place to do final battle with Silva is also Bond 's most emotionally dangerous territory - the place where he lost his parents as a boy . It 's here that the three damaged , strong central characters - Bond , M , and Silva - have to face themselves and each other . `` Skyfall '' is an example of an elevated action film . When I grew up in the 80 's , action films were mostly populated by hack actors , with weak storylines and mediocre directing . Skyfall utilizes a talented filmmaker ( Sam Mendes , the man behind `` American Beauty '' ) , powerhouse actors ( Craig , Bardem , and Judi Dench are all wonderful ) a strong script and lush cinematography to prove , once again , that any genre of film can be elevated when the people behind it have the talent and skill required ."}, "26577": {"id": "26576", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "If you like James bond movies , you 'll enjoy this one as well .

Back in the 1950 's and 1960 's , that 's how Bond was imagined by his creator . Go back to the books - start with Casino Royale or From Russia with Love - and you will see that Bond is a tough , loyal , hard-edged spy . Daniel Craig brings this kind of Bond back . Sean Connery was glamorous , Roger Moore was silly , but Daniel Craig acts , moves , and thinks like a spy.And the villain in `` SkyFall '' was once an important asset of MI6 ... perhaps a friend of Bond once . He is the enemy today because he wants revenge . Why ? He was cruelly betrayed by Britain and M when it was expedient for him to get captured and tortured . He was traded for 6 other British agents . See the film `` The Spy Who Came in From the Cold '' to get an idea how governments will and do make these choices at the personal sacrifice of their agents . When my father was a spy against the Nazis for the French this was a real fear when he operated in enemy territory . Can you really trust your own side , when you live in the shadows ? And so Raoul Silva ( Javier Barden ) - the new enemy of MI6 - was born by surviving his betrayal . Governments do create their own Frankensteins.Both the flawed psychological , hurt natures of Bond and Silva are explored in this brilliant thriller . As Judi Dench ( as M ) puts it , orphans make the best spies.Although there are some extraordinary stunts in the film , gone are most of the spy gadgets that helped Bond get out of trouble . He has to use his brains , not only his courage , to win this showdown . I love the part when he goes back into time , and drives his `` Goldfinger '' vehicle again . The gadget that villian Raoul Silva uses , is one we live with everyday - the computer . For he is an expert in cybercrime.Now we have reached Bond at 50 - Daniel Craig nails it . Although I must confess that this Bond is someone who does n't smile or enjoy luxury wines - something I miss from the Sean Connery days ."}, "26584": {"id": "26583", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It seems the British take great pride in producing Bond . A great thrill . The action explodes into more action . A great treat for the senses ."}, "26585": {"id": "26584", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Note : I will not say much about the plot here . If you really want to know , it 's easy to find out . But I believe you will enjoy the movie more without knowing what will happen , especially what happens leading up to the showdown at Skyfall - you do NOT even want to know in advance WHO IS THERE at Skyfall , trust me , or you will miss some of the emotional punch . So here goes ... My first impression , right after the movie : not enough spectacle.The opening chase was pretty good , but otherwise there 's not much in the way of thrills in the middle apart from a couple of brief scuffles ( and a poorly-chosen mode of vertical travel ) . The action is not that interesting , but thankfully it is not shot in the idiotically shaky `` Bourne-camera '' mode . And there is a ridiculous thing involving a , uh , diverted train , which does n't really add much . The finale is a mixed bag - more complexity would have been nice , but it 's interesting because Bond is preposterously outgunned.But a little later it sinks in : this is not the heart of the movie . Yes , surprisingly , it 's about heart.This movie is about depth , in more ways than one . It is about creating and experiencing a deeper , emotional connection with the characters , especially Bond . And in this it truly succeeds . You feel for the poor guy , from his opening plunge , through his feelings of betrayal and duty , and to the deep , terrible loss that is embodied in one of the movie 's most important characters , Skyfall Lodge - Bond 's childhood home . It is a genuinely moving , touching , darker and deeper Bond . When I watch it again , it will be for those moments.Everyone is top-notch - Bond , M , the new Q , and of course Silva , played by Javier Bardem as a strangely sympathetic monster you ca n't stop watching . His meetings with Bond seem anticlimactic , and their final face-off not too satisfying , but his connection to M is well-played , disturbing and affecting.M has a greater role here , explored in more depth - the hard calls she has to make , her connection ( such as it is ) with her agents , and her dedication . Her hard-nosedness and her professional and physical vulnerability are nicely juxtaposed . One of the most moving moments is her quoting Tennyson -Though much is taken , much abides ; and thoughWe are not now that strength which in old daysMoved earth and heaven ; that which we are , we are ; One equal temper of heroic hearts , Made weak by time and fate , but strong in willTo strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield.- while we see Bond , a broken and betrayed Bond , a seemingly outdated relic , rushing to save her . It is quite a powerful moment , one that you will want to see again.At the end , the movie takes an unexpected turn which ties it into the whole Bond mythology . Although tinged with sadness , fans will rejoice.The title song , which seemed weak and forgettable on first listen ( before seeing the movie ) , turns out to suit the movie quite well along with the brooding visuals of the opening credits . Both take on more meaning and emotional wallop after having viewed the movie , and I find I could watch them again and again : Let the sky fallWhen it crumblesWe will stand tallFace it all togetherThat last line really hits home , in the context of the finale.So - I wish there were more spectacular action . The middle drags a bit . But it is compelling and engaging on an emotional level , giving us a Bond we can feel for and even cheer on ."}, "26586": {"id": "26585", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The cinematography in this is excellent !

Yes , and that tough call complicates matters for MI6 ; even James Bond 's loyalty is put to the test . However , with world class villains ( and his own death ) to contend with , there is n't a moment to reflect on her misdeeds.Director Sam Mendes ( `` Revolutionary Road '' ) is working for the first time with the Broccoli family , who has owned this Bond franchise for 50 years . There is no doubt Mendes knows exactly what the fans expect , he delivers non-stop action , wonderful reminders of past Bond films , lots of gunfire and fisticuffs , plus oodles of blowie uppie stuff ! We recognize the regulars , but watch for some new ones , too : * Daniel Craig ( `` Defiance '' ) is back as Bond , resurrected from the dead and furious that M gave the order to shoot him ( he was wearing an ear bud ) . Now he must cope with a damaged body that does n't do quite what he wants . * Judi Dench ( `` The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel '' ) is still M , beleaguered , bedeviled and besieged . Of course , her quips are almost as funny as Bond 's . * Ben Whishaw ( `` Cloud Atlas '' ) is the callow youth who personifies this generation of technophiles . Yup , to Bond 's dismay , this mop-headed geek is our new Q and we love him from the get-go ! * Naomie Harris ( `` Mandala , Long Walk to Freedom '' ) is Bond 's sidekick in the opening scenes in Istanbul . Wait until you hear her last name ! * Javier Barden ( `` Biutiful '' ) seems to have SUCH fun playing villains ; this flaxen-haired bad guy is almost as persistent as our hero ; he just does n't know when to quit ! Revenge is a powerful motivator.This popular franchise illustrates what we mean when we say `` sensory overload . '' It is n't necessary to suspend disbelief in these things because we know as we walk in the door that we will be bombarded with PG-13 cartoony violence , hair's-breath escapes and quippy dialogue . It 's what we want , it 's what we pay for and it 's what we get !

The thief was Raoul Silva ( Javier Bardem ) , also an ex-MI6 agent , gets access to the internal server network of MI6 and tries to destroy the entire organization and kill its chief , ` M ' as a vengeance to an old treachery of M when he was in service .

Raoul attacks Skyfall as per Bond 's plan , but Bond will not be able to save M , in the battle with Raoul , though he kills the later.The special effects , screenplay and cinematography employed in the movie are simply superb and absolutely extravagant .

Making the 23rd James Bond movie is no enviable task . Make it in the traditional way and it looks like retread and parody , like Brosnan 's last two . Depart from the traditional and it 's not really a James Bond movie , like Quantum of Solace . This is a series that has had to be remade several times to fit in with the era and to make Bond 's exploits interesting . Skyfall is n't so much a remake as it a back to basics . Much of it has an old-school feel to it . Q & Moneypenny are reintroduced and a new M is introduced . The Bond villain is n't part of some absurd global criminal organization . He 's just a cackling madman From the Connery/Moore days played perfectly by Javier Bardem . Bardem is the best Bond villain since Sean Bean in Goldeneye . Craig 's Bond is n't some tortured antihero . He 's a professional killer w a smart mouth . The beauty of James Bond movies used to be how they were pure escapism . Bond 's psychology was n't explored , much less considered . He was more of a cypher through which the viewer could live his or her fantasies of jet-setting and saving the world . The eternal sunshine of 007 's spotless mind . Skyfall edges closer to that . We get some personal stuff but not nearly the tortured angst of the last two entries . Skyfall runs well over two hours but does n't feel too long like most movies do these days . There 's no Bond girl this time around and that is disappointing . Bond movies tend to work best when there 's an element of sexiness to them . Some of the plot and action sequences are obviously borrowed from other movies like Batman and Die Hard .

Believed to be dead , MI6 finds their last , best hope to prevent information exposing agents embedded in terrorist organizations worldwide almost as dead in the water as Bond.Bond stays out of the public eye enjoying `` death '' but returns to offer his services to a very surprised M ( Judi Dench ) when MI6 is blown apart by Silva ( Javier Bardem ) a terrorist determined to take revenge against M and the agency at all costs.Bond unexpectantly finds that he has far more in common with Silva than he ever thought.END OF SPOILERS : When it was announced that dramatic director Sam Mendes was going to tackle the latest Bond film , there was a mixture of surprise and trepidation as he had never tackled an action film before . Mendes ' experience as a director of stage and screen came in handy allowing him to develop a Bond film with more dramatic depth and heft than might have occurred otherwise.Many Bond films rise or fall ( Skyfall ) based on the set pieces in the film i.e. , the action sequences embelished with plenty of stunts . `` Skyfall '' opens with an exceptionally good one that measures up to the stunning opening for `` Casino Royale '' . Bond films also rise and fall based on how complex and interesting the villian is in the piece . Bardem does a good job creating a fascinating bad guy whose grip on his sanity is slippery at best . Bardem makes Silva much more interesting than your standard Bond villian and , perhaps , almost as colorful as Goldfinger or Blofeld . Now that EON productions and United Artists/MGM/Sony ownNever Say Never Again ( Blu-ray Version ) and the rights to Blofeld , maybe we 'll see that character reintroduced in the next installment.The script by Joshua Logan with Neal Puris & Robert Wade effortlessly incorporates elements of older Bond films ( in a nice tip of the hat in one scene toGoldfinger ( 50th Anniversary Repackage ) [ Blu-ray ] ) , as well as , introducing new variations on old characters.Featuring ( for the first time ) some of the best known actors of British stage and screen , `` Skyfall '' sets a new standard for Bond films measuring up to the best reboot to feature CraigCasino Royale ( Blu-ray + DVD ) and expanding to incorporate popular touches from previous films.The Blu-ray looks terrific with a strong , detailed presentation . The audio is equally impressive with an immersive mix.The special features are another thing entirely . While the commentary track by director Mendes is terrific ( noting tributes to other films and directors ) and the one featuring producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli provides nice detail as well , the featurettes ( which can be viewed as a single documentary if you choose ) are a bit on the superifical side particularly when compared to the terrific ones for the classic Bond films . Still , they are n't bad -- they do cover interesting material just not in depth by comparison to what we 've seen in the past.We also get a standard DVD included with the Blu-ray as well as the option to watch the film via Ultra Violet.Bond 's latest adventure returns luster to the series as the so-so reception forQuantum of Solace [ Blu-ray ] . Actor Daniel Craig who has added a primal edge to Bond is signed up for at least two more outings . I 'm hoping that they will be as good as this one and continue to develop the material that we see here in `` Skyfall '' .Highly recommended ."}, "26637": {"id": "26636", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Good movie"}, "26638": {"id": "26637", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Not Moore 's tongue in cheek approach , or Connery 's super suave Bond .

The figure on the left is John Nettles who has starred in all 13 seasons . He stopped at the end of the season 13 and the actor on the right took over the Barnaby role as his cousin .

The high camp humor continues throughout . The concluding one is rather poignant as we learn then that John Nettles is retiring as Chief Inspector Barnaby .

As well as a Grand Prize of the Festival nomination at the Cannes Film Festival ( `` Guardie e ladri '' , 1951 ) and Palme d'Or nominations for `` For Love and Gold '' ( 1966 ) , `` Vogliamo i colonnelli '' ( 1973 ) , `` An Average Little Man '' ( 1977 ) and `` Le due vite di Mattia Pascal '' ( 1985 ) .And while he is known outside of Italy for his comedy films such as `` I soliti ignoti '' ( `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' ) and collaborating with talents such as Toto , Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni , Mastroianni also directed films that contained humor , but were tragic or futile . One of the most important films Monicelli is known for is `` La grande guerra '' ( `` The Great War '' , 1959 ) , which he was nominated for an Academy Award and considered as his top masterpiece , and also directing `` i compagni '' ( `` The Organizer '' , 1963 ) and `` The Girl with the Pistol '' ( 1968 ) . Both films , he would also receive Academy Award nominations . Fitting films for a Marxist who accepted reality and its failures.In his lifetime , he won 27 awards worldwide and won an Honorable Mention at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival and a Golden Lion for Career at the 1991 Venice Film Festival . His final film was in 2006 in which the filmmaker directed `` The Roses of the Desert '' at the age of 91.A man full who lived life to the fullest , unfortunately his final years with prostate cancer would become too much of a burden on the filmmaker that he committed suicide in 2010 at the age of 95.While many people are familiar with Monicelli 's comedy films such as `` Big Deal on Madonna Street '' , which was released by the Criterion Collection back in 2001 . Criterion Collection will be releasing `` i Compagni '' ( `` The Organizer '' ) , one of his more serious films ala `` tragicomedy '' for the first time on Blu-ray and will also be released on DVD in April 2012.VIDEO : '' The Organizer '' is presented in 1080p High Definition ( 1:85:1 aspect ratio ) . The whites and grays are well-contrast and black levels are very deep . For the most part , I detected no film damage or any white specks , artifacts or banding issues . The quality of the film is very good , does n't look soft and viewers should be pleased.According to the Criterion Collection , this new high-definition transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a new 35 mm print . Thousands of instances of dirt , debris , scratches , splices , warps , jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI 's DRS system and Pixel Farm 's PFClean , while Image Systems DVNR was used for small dirt , grain and noise reduction.AUDIO & SUBTITLES : '' The Organizer '' is presented in LPCM 1.0 monaural Italian with optional English subtitles . Dialogue is crystal clear and I detected no pops or hiss during my viewing of this film.According to the Criterion Collection , the original stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical soundtrack positive . Clicks , thumps , hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD . Crackle was attenuated using Audio Cube 's integrated workstation.SPECIAL FEATURES : '' The Organizer - The Criterion Collection # 610 ' on Blu-ray comes with the following special features : Mario Monicelli - ( 10:53 ) Featuring an interview with director Mario Monicelli recorded by the Criterion Collection in 2006 . Monicelli talks about Commedia all'Italiana and his career.Theatrical trailer -Theatrical trailer for `` The Organizer '' .EXTRAS : '' The Organizer - The Criterion Collection # 610 ' comes with a 4-page ( dual sided ) fold-out leaflet , featuring the essay `` Description of a Struggle '' by J. Hoberman.JUDGMENT CALL : I simply adore the films by Mario Monicelli and when it comes to `` The Organizer '' , it 's rather fascinating because when it comes to films about workers going on strike , in many modern films , the outcome has always been in the employees favor and always positive outcome of how labor laws were changed.But not so much the case in cinema past , especially films from Europe.From Sergei Eisenstein 's 1925 film `` Stachka '' ( Strike ) that showcased Eisenstein 's theme of collectivism versus individualism and showcasing how employees work themselves to death while owners and management are wealthy and could care less about their employees , Eisenstein 's film was grounded in Lenin belief that , `` The strength of the working class is organization . Without organization of the masses , the proletarian is nothing . Organized it is everything . Being organized means unity of action , unity of practical activity '' .We fast forward to 1963 and similar to `` Strike '' , Monicelli 's film is set during the turn-of-the-twentieth century Turin . As Eisenstein 's film preached Leninism , Monicelli believed in Marxism , which literally is a society in which burgeois or idealism do not exist.In today 's world , specifically here in the West , the idea of long work hours , employment of children and literally no breaks can not be fathomed . But yet this mentality still continues in other countries . The reality for some countries today and how things were back then is that people accept their working condition and the fear of the harsh realities of not making any income is enough for one not to stand up and become defiant towards their management . As a collective , not many are willing to do public protests , strike back in the media nor are they in a position financially to do so.This is the reality today.And back then , a lot of these individuals had no means to strike back , especially as a collective through media or political means . In Eisenstein 's `` Strike '' , the reality of the employees and their organized strike was violence . Violence towards the management , violence towards any other employees who were not able to hold out from the strike and were willing to return to their jobs . And unfortunately , all that is left is tragedy.Fortunately , Monicelli 's `` The Organizer '' is a film that showcases Monicelli 's belief that the reality is what it is , and the employees of Turin need to realize that going on strike may have hurt the management but in the long run , the reality is they have the means to outlast the workers , because they have the money to survive.And another juxtaposition with Eisenstein 's `` Strike '' is that the people were ready to fight and die for what they believe in . This was the Leninism perspective of working as a collective . Monicelli 's `` The Organizer '' featured a collective that was held on a string , courtesy of Professor Sinigaglia , but it was evident that these workers have families , children that depend on them and while some maybe able to fight , the outcome is much more different , despite their being a tragedy.Another key difference is the inclusion of comedy . Eisenstein 's `` Strike '' was primarily focused on the strike itself and the differences of lifestyle with the factory workers and the wealthy and how the financial impact was hurting families.In Monicelli 's `` The Organizer '' , times are tough but yet there is humor . May it be a man who tries to flirt with a young woman , the stocky long-time employee Pautasso during his lunch break as he holds a huge circular bread to chow down on , or may it be a young boy who is not afraid to talk back to his elders ( and also admonishing his younger brother who is attending school but would rather be an employee at the factory ) or the local prostitute who tries to entice Professor Sinigaglia.There are many of these moments that help the viewer get closer to various characters and see that despite how difficult the times are , they try to make the best of it.So , for me , `` The Organizer '' has always been a fascinating film as it is an intriguing juxtaposition when compared to Eisenstein 's film . Both have similarities but yet are very different.Actor Marcelo Mastroianni is often seen playing a suave , charismatic character that always gets the lady and come to think of it , I suppose nothing has changed as the Professor also manages to find a woman but in different circumstances . But Mastroianni does a good job playing Professor Sinigaglia and being the spoken leader for the workers.But as Marcelo Mastroianni is the lead actor , what I enjoyed most of the film are the workers who attract the viewers through their feebleness , their humor or directive . Renato Salvatori , Gabriella Gieorgelli , Folco Lullu , Bernard Blier , Raffaella Carra and many more , its the supporting cast of the film that makes `` The Organizer '' come to life . The performances are honest and humorous but also feel realistic and natural , and because of that , it does add to the engaging storyline.As for the Blu-ray release , the video quality of `` The Organizer '' is fantastic and the interview with Mario Monicelli included on this Blu-ray was also enjoyable to watch , considering it was shot during a time when he was in good health and a few years before he died . Although I wish there were more special features included , especially audio commentary , I 'm still grateful that this interview with Monicelli was included on this Blu-ray release.Overall , `` The Organizer '' has always been one of my favorite Monicelli films and I can only hope that with this release , it will pave the way for more Monicelli films such as `` La Grande Guerra '' ( `` The Great War '' ) , `` The Girl With the Pistol '' or `` L'armata Brancaleone '' ( `` For Love and Gold '' ) to receive a video release . `` The Organizer '' is highly recommended !"}, "26663": {"id": "26662", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Infinite Stratos is by far one of the best action-harem comedies i have seen .

The plot in this film picks up 5 years after the earlier Don ended . SRK wants to dominate the European underworld , to set his plan in to motion he must seek the assistance of his arch enemy Vardhan ( Boman Irani ) , but Vardhan is in prison . So SRK gets himself arrested and lands up in jail to get him out and set his plan in motion . The plan : steal the money printing plates of the German Central Bank . Don 2 has several things in it favor , a witty script laced with Donisms , one liners which are already a rage . An example Mallik : Tumhari talaash toh duniya ki har police ko hai ... kiss kiss se baat karu ? Don : Aaj yeh sunkar meri maa kitni khush hoti . Mallik : Apne hathon se hi tumhe goli maar deti . Don : Mr Mallik , aap meri maa ko nahi jaante the . The engaging script has several moments which keep you hooked , such as above , great script , the locations , acting , cinematography and did not let up during the entirety of the 2.30 run time . I personally thought that the following scenes were superb : Jail Break in MalaysiaHrithik Roshan 's cameoThe car chase in BerlinThe fight scenesThe plot to stealThe final minutes of the filmSRK has completely transformed his body and has a physical presence that suits this role , he is buff and intense in the physically demanding scenes . After 20 years on the scene , not many actors can entertain and keep you interested like SRK does . Priyanka Chopra looks pretty but somehow lacks the physical presence that is required of the character . As is , the film does not have a lot of things for her to do . Kuanl Kapoor and Lara Dutta are perfect in their mini roles.Hrithik Roshan is funny ... ... .Jawwab Shah ( Jabbar ) has a towering presence bit is dwarfed by the leads.The weakest link of the film was the music , the 1978 had some of the best loved music which is popular even today . The music of the 2006 remake managed to impress as well . This soundtrack is a utter and complete disappointment , how on earth did Shankar - Ehsaan-Loy manage such a below average soundtrack . Shame on Farhan Akhtar ... ... ..Besides SRK , the cinematography of Jason West raises the bar to make the film come alive ... ..I highly recommend this film and enjoyed it . I enjoyed the 2D version , the film was shot in it as well and do not see the point of watching it again in 3D . Please notice the final frames of the film as the stage is set for Don 3 ( hint , notice the number plate of Don 's bike ) SRK reaffirms my faith in him again , his past few film have not been up to the mark for me . DON 2 should easily make him the king of the block once again . 4 stars . 12/23/2011"}, "26680": {"id": "26679", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Great to see Shahrukh Khan back in the bad guy character !

It incorporates mythologies and cultural folklores ; however , they are the `` Lost Girl '' version of myths and legends . It has characters , action , and escapades that are enthralling and entertaining . The creator and producers have described the series as a supernatural crime drama with light comedy and it definitely lives up to their description.The protagonist of Lost Girl is Bo ( Anna Silk ) , a bisexual succubus that was adopted and raised by human parents . A succubus is a creature that must feed on the `` chi '' ( the life force ) of humans and Fae to survive ; and when injured absorbs the chi and energy created during sexual encounters to heal . Being the modern version of the mythical succubus , Bo feeding or healing from either a male or female is irrelevant because it 's all sexual healing to her . Bo accidentally killed her high school boyfriend by draining his chi during her first sexual encounter and it was after this incident that her parents told her she had been adopted . Thereafter , Bo fled from home and everything she had known , living a friendless existence , accumulating a history of chi-drained bodies ; moving from city to city and creating a new identity each time.Bo saves a human woman , Kenzi ( Ksenia Solo ) , from a rapist by draining his chi and when she realizes what Bo did for her , the two become instant friends ( with Kenzi as Bo 's streets-smart sidekick ) . This kill brings the heretofore unknown Bo to the attention of the local Fae clans . The Fae are powerful supernatural beings that have existed in secrecy among humans since the beginning of civilization , despising and using them for their own benefit . Their world is divided into two clans , the Light and Dark , with the Dark being the most evil and criminally-inclined of the two ; however , although the Light Fae are more diplomatic , both sides use humans as slaves , servants , and food . Bo is abducted by two Fae police detectives and brought to the Light Fae leader , The Ash , for interrogation . It is here that Bo discovers that she is not the only one who is ` different ' . It is also here that she meets her future romantic lovers , the wolf-shifter and police detective , Dyson ( Kris Holden-Ried ) ; and Lauren ( Zoie Palmer ) , the human physician & scientist obligated to serve The Ash . When the Ash orders Lauren ( Dr. Lewis ) to examine Bo and determine what kind of Fae she is , Bo is told by Lauren that she is a succubus and that , if she wanted to , she could learn to control her chi-feeding power and sexual drive . Each clan wants Bo to align herself with one or the other , but after being forced to defend herself in a contest trial , Bo refuses to abandon her ties to humanity and determines to search for the truth about her origins and who she really is . Rounding the cast of central characters are Trick ( Richard Howland ) , owner and bartender of the local Fae tavern , `` The Dal Riata '' ; and Hale ( K.C . Collins ) , a siren & police detective working alongside Dyson . Minor characters include The Morrigan ( Emmanuelle Vaugier ) , vengeful leader of the Dark Fae with an instant dislike of Bo ; and Vex , a mesmer serving as the henchman for The Morrigan , and a darling of the Dark Fae Elders.The women of Lost Girl are strong , resourceful , and live their lives on their own terms . The interpersonal relationships between men and women are equal in status in spite of their differences . Compared to the sex scenes involving Dyson , the first lovemaking scene between Bo and Lauren may seem tame , but it is nevertheless intense . ( Fact : The pilot for the show later became Episode 8 of Season 1 , and contains the initial lesbian love scene between Bo and Lauren . Regardless of what naysayers may say , from the outset the relationship with Lauren was intended to be as essential to Bo 's emotional evolution as her relationship with Dyson . ) Along with the creatures , adventures , rolls in the hay , cleavage , and Bo 's intrepid journey to find her place in the world with the family she creates along the way , Lost Girl is very much about a sex-positive universe where sexual orientation is not judged . The core nature of Fae and humans , and their interconnections , are not affected by any one of them being bisexual , heterosexual , or homosexual.Lost Girl is produced by Prodigy Pictures for Canada 's Showcase TV network and broadcast by the Syfy TV network in the United States , United Kingdom ( UK and Ireland ) , and Australia . The DVD & Blu-ray contain the unedited episodes as shown on Canadian television ( Season 1 has 13 episodes ; Season 2 has 22 episodes ; Season 3 has 13 episodes ) . Episodes running time : 44 minutes.Lost Girl is rated TV-MA ( Mature Audiences Only ) L-S-V ( Language , Sex , Violence ) and may be unsuitable for those younger than 17 years of age . ( Unhappy news about the Blu-ray I received : when I opened the package all three discs were covered with dust , with the third disc having the most on it .

'' This gothic soap opera had its cheesy moments here and there , but it had that rare quality of being addictive and entertaining even as it had vampires , ghosts and werewolves . Even better : it drips with traditional gothic atmosphere , with a young woman afloat in a dark , gloomy house filled with secrets.Victoria Winters ( Alexandra Moltke ) arrives in Maine to be a governess to the reclusive Collins family , intending to find out about her past ( since she seems to have some kind of connection to them ... or something ) . Instead , she finds a big stew of weird -- the mansion of Collinswood apparently has ghosts and magic , as well as a vampire in the mausoleum.Yes , Barnabas Collins ( Jonathan Frid ) is in the mausoleum ... and his entrance ( and subsequent transformation into the primary character ) is the point when the show went from `` okay '' to `` awesome . '' From then on , the story unfolds into a long , complicated tangle of lost love , amnesia , time travel , witchcraft , MORE ghosts , reincarnation , golems , body-swapping sorcerers , the ancient Leviathans and a parallel universe -- all centered on the Collins family.It 's really quite hard to summarize the entire series , but suffice to say that `` Dark Shadows '' is a pretty delicious series -- it drips with romanticized gothic atmosphere , with plenty of classic tropes ( vampires , ghosts , even a Frankenstein monster ) . And for a soap opera of any type -- be it supernatural or mundane -- it 's actually very well written , with distinct plot arcs and ongoing plot threads.The slowest part of the story is actually the beginning parts , which were fairly low on supernatural events and focused on Victoria . But once `` Dark Shadows '' embraced the supernatural , it blossoms like a black rose . Does it have cheezy moments ? Yes , sometimes -- but unlike the cheeziness of a lot of vampire-themed TV/movies , there 's a dignified , almost classical quality to `` Dark Shadows . `` And it has a pretty decent cast over all , with Lara Parker , David Selby and Grayson Hall as a few of the most prominent standouts . But the best one is undeniably Frid as Barnabas Collins -- his character was such an intriguing one that he not only became one of the primary characters , but evolved from a tortured villain into a selfless , heroic anti-hero.As for the layout of this series , nobody is 100 % sure at this time of the content , but if it does have 131 discs it almost certainly has the complete series , both with and without the vampire subplots . But do n't expect any special extras , probably.For people burned out on current vampire stuff , `` Dark Shadows : The Complete Series '' is a refreshingly classic look at vampire/supernatural soapiness .

I purchased one of the 40-episode sets , and guess what ? I fell in love with it all over again . As cast member Marie Wallace ( Eve , Jenny Collins ) states in an interview , `` Dark Shadows '' is true theater '' . This is warts and all television . There is nothing like a videotaped series . It has an intimacy that can not be achieved through film . Lots of closeups of actors , sometimes with their faces just a few inches apart while they are speaking . It is utterly fascinating stuff .

His manners so charm the Collins matriarch that discrepancies in his story are forever overlooked . Everyone is instead worried over the disappearance of the threatening Willy Loomis , little realizing he 's already become the vampire 's minion . We quickly move to color , sitting in on a very 1960s-style mod seance that shockingly transports the governess Victoria Winters back to 1795 , to solve the mystery of Barnabas ' ghostly sister Sara . There follows our first meeting with Angelique , the witch who bedevils Barnabas across time , played perfectly by one of TV 's best-ever ice queens , the blonde beauty Lara Parker.Jumping ahead , Dr. Hoffman figures out that Quentin Collins is a werewolf , and as Julia and Barnabas become cohorts at solving the mysteries of Collinwood , they travel to Parallel Time , where familiar faces act out a version of Rebecca ( with Grayson Hall excelling in the Mrs. Danvers role ) , and to the future where Collinwood lies in ruins , and Caroline and Quentin have gone insane . A very young Kate Jackson appears as the mysterious ghost Daphne , another governess with a secret , enlivening the show 's later years.Through all , we see the famous Collinwood set , the medieval staircase that frames so much of the action , and you can watch each numbered episode with informative introductions by Kathryn Leigh Scott , who played Maggie Evans through all her perils in past , present , future and parallel time .

AGAIN.Do n't get me wrong - I will buy whatever I can possibly get from any soap opera from any era , especially before `` my time '' or when I was a kid in the 1970 's aand 80 's . AND will never ever buy a soap set that is recent episodes only ( 1999+ would not be worthe the money , as they recent enough that I have seen them ) - Guiding Light is great because I have only seen episodes from the Tammy Jonathan years through the end of the show so having many I have n't seen is fabulous.ANYONE who loves soaps or understands soap fans MUST inherently know that we love the people , the characters , the stories , the buildup , the history . If you want anyone other than diehard fans to buy it - you are on the wrong track . I want to watch STORYLINES , how they got together and ended up getting married , how they fell in love , what happened after ... .what made her a vixen or him a villain ? Who killed who and why - who did they think killed who and why ... None of these stories are told in one or 2 episodes , they lasted months , or years even . I WANT STORIES - that 's why they were called STORIES in my mother 's time , because that 's why everyone loved them.You want new people to buy them ? Release the STORYLINES as complete as possible , you want SOAPfans to Buy it AND love it , AND save up our money for the next release ? RELEASE THE STORIES ! If you are giving us multiple quick releases to get momentum , at least give us hope that we will get something more than Weddings and tributes and plucked episodes in the future . Give us news that you are working on SOMETHING MORE even if it takes time.PLEASE I BEG OF YOU ... ..Peyton PLace was such a terrific Soap release - I got a set for me and then mom wanted a set , then Grandma wanted a set , none of us had ever seen them but we all LOVED watching the 2 sets with full storylines.SoapsClassic needs to give respect to the genre by releasing STORYLINES and following characters with full episodes , over time . Soap Fans will pay and if it has storylines that can be followed and characters to connect with , others will follow . Tributes are for diehard , single show fans , and fans of ANYTHING SOAPS but that 's about it . And if you do n't give us hope for anything more , we 'll stop checking to see what 's coming next.BUT - Thank you so very much for whatever I can get ."}, "26715": {"id": "26714", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I always had watched Pokemon since i was young and I liked how all these 4 movies were all put into one blu-ray disc ."}, "26716": {"id": "26715", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Love the collection 's ... . only bummer part is 3 of Hellraiser collection is n't in it .

Lots of green screen shots , lots of CGI that does n't match up to the budget of the SyFy show . All in all , a good start . The story has some holes and some predictable twists along with some others you do n't see coming . Luke Pasqualino as Adama seems to settle into things and could develop into a strong lead . Ben Cotton 's portrayal of the warworn veteran , Coker , who ca n't stand his new rookie pilot is probably the strongest of the lot . The side characters are really good as well . Some of the writing is really good . While I wo n't write them here they are both toward the end of the last web episode , one for each side . They set up the rest of potential series very nicely .

Shame.The actual SYFY channel has completely abandoned all things science fiction . A few years ago MGM was taken over by new management and they immediately decided to cancel the following : SG : A , SG : U , the new SG-1 movie ( SG : Revolution ) , and the new SG : A movie ( SGA : Extinction ) .As long as this current bunch of skin-jobs is in charge we will never get real sci-fi .

A small gripe for us computer animators - we 'll instantly notice the underdeveloped dynamics programing and very quick decay rates on those effects but other than that it 's all top grade stuff .

Fresh out of the academy , Adama ( played by Luke Pasqualino ) is assigned to the powerful battlestar Galactica , where he 's met with contention from his co-pilot Coker ( Ben Cotton ) , and is assigned to escort a beautiful but mysterious woman ( Lili Bordan ) on a secret mission.Originally shown in small `` webisodes '' online , almost every shot from Blood & Chrome was done on green screen . The result is A LOT of CGI , most of which looks really great . The space and aerial battles especially look marvelous , and the few Cylons you see look really good as well . There were a few action and landscape shots I thought looked kind of cheap but overall , when you consider almost the entire show was created in post-production , the effects rival a lot of shows on TV today and look very similar to those seen on the BSG series.Blood & Chrome was created with hopes of getting a series order in mind , which probably wo n't happen , and because of this the story and character development felt rushed to me . There 's really only the three main characters , none of which I really got attached to , and a few other supporting characters that had a few lines . Perhaps because the creators thought they would get a series out of the show , they were going to save some of the backstory and further development for later . However , as it stands the 90 minute show does n't really tell you much about who these characters are or what brought them to the Galactica . It also did n't help that the cast is made up of relatively unknown actors who , thought they try , do n't have the chops to keep up with the actors from the reimagined BSG series . The story was fun and engaging , I just wish there had been more depth.The Bluray set comes with DVD and digital copies , as well as a few extras including a bunch of deleted scenes and a making-of featurette that delves into the visual effects created for Blood and Chrome . This behind-the-scenes feature is quite interesting to watch as it interviews most of the people involved in the creative process behind the special and gives some awesome insight into the development and creation of making a show that 's most computer generated.If you 're a fan of the Ron Moore , series I would definitely check this out . It 's not quite up to par with the series but is still a fun adventure that will make you want to revisit the sci-fi series.On a side note , the 188 minutes Amazon lists as the running time is inaccurate ; the feature itself is around 90 minutes and I think Amazon added the Bluray and DVD discs together ."}, "26727": {"id": "26726", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Blood and Chrome should of been made into a series .

It plays well as a movie-length film , and the only downside is that the powers that be at Sci-Fi ( or any other cable/digital/broadcast entity ) did n't green light this to become an ongoing series . Yes , the `` Caprica '' prequel turned out to be pretty dismal , but this show looks much better and more tightly focussed , and raises a number of interesting , unsettling issues about the history of the Human-Cylon conflict . Fortunately , Pasqualino is pretty baby-faced and young : I suppose it 's possible he could still take up the role later on if the BSG creative team can get this series off the ground , even if it takes a few years.Anyway , if you 're a Galactica fan , have no fear : this is exciting , satisfying , intelligently written and well-made .

They very much portray him as a hot head who is always looking for a fight . You do not see any of the characters from the original series . At this point the Cylons are still just the chrome versions , although see the beginnings of the `` skin job '' versions at the very end.It seems people fall into a couple different categories about this . Much like the Caprica series they either love it or really hate it . I liked the series , but was not so devoted to seeing just those characters that any kind of spin off would be awful . It is really just an extension of the universe that was created for that story . It is like a long episode , telling a single story and that is it .

VEEP is one of the most unfunny shows ever created . Yes , it really is that bad . As I watched the entire first season I think I honestly laughed perhaps once and that was just a small chuckle , not a belly laugh . Having just seen THIS IS THE END and actually finding myself laughing out loud about 15 times in the middle of a theater , this show never inspired that once while sitting in the comfort of my living room . It really is unfunny and displays in so many ways how out of touch Hollywood is with the real world.Julia Louis-Dreyfuss , an actress who has shown time and time again that she knows how to be funny , stars as the title character , Senator Selina Meyer who has just taken on the role of Vice President . But what she thought would be a position that would provide her with some power and a direct link to the White House ends up being nothing of the sort . Selina is given little more to do than the bidding of the President , helping him to shore up votes he needs for projects while never getting credit or the chance to forward her own ideas.Through it all she plays the political games where back stabbing is a virtue and keeping a smile plastered on your face while twisting the knife is the norm . This same theme is used quite well with Netflix series HOUSE OF CARDS but here it falls flat.Meyers has surrounded herself with complete idiots or career builders who are more inclined to take care of themselves than her . Some have the potential to be funny characters but are never given the chance to show it . Instead they seem to think that the more they drop the F bomb the funnier they are . This made me worry about how much input Louis-Dreyfuss had in the scripts as I thought back to the time period when Saturday Night Live became a show that was unfunny ... and when she was a cast member . At that time they seemed to tell jokes that they thought were funny but that no one laughed at . I found this series to be much like that.I had heard this series was funny . I even remember several people involved being nominated for Emmys . After watching it I found my feelings about the Emmys and other awards given in Hollywood to be vindicated . Rather than honor anyone for true talent and ability it seems as though they give out awards for simply being someone they like or for trying to portray anyone they dislike in an unfavorable way . Anyone connected with this show who would win did n't deserve it and should immediately give the award back.I was stunned to see that a second season of this series has already aired and that a third is on the way . It makes me wonder what shows that delivered pilots to HBO were turned down . Surely there was something else that deserved the funding that this show gets . The only thing this show made me want to do was turn back to television to see if a rerun of SEINFELD was on . Now that show was funny and so was Louis-Dreyfuss when she was in it .

What starts out as a cautionary tale about contagion and survival descends in its later half into a curious misfire , almost as entangled as the vines featured so prominently on the product packaging.Somehow , mankind is slowly being driven to the brink of extinction by the Medousa Virus , a lethal plague that ( you guessed it ! ) turns people into stone . Before life itself comes to an end , a mysterious corporation concocts a grand scheme : select 160 virus-free participants to be cryogenically frozen and placed in stasis until such a time that a cure is developed , at which point they could be ` thawed ' and given the task of repopulating the planet . While the selection criteria remain a bit nebulous , the plan is launched , and young Kasumi ( but not her twin sister , Shizuku ) is chosen . The computer program running the facility promises to wake everyone up in 100 years OR whenever a cure is assured ( whichever comes first ) , but , to the participants surprise , they are re-activated after only a scant three days ! The processing center has been overrun by massive , serpentine plants and man-eating dinosaurs.Their new mission : save themselves in time to figure out what went wrong ? Certainly , it 's an interesting premise , one that veers into some reasonably creative territory very quickly if not all a little too perfunctorily . There are shades of greater influences here - THE MATRIX , JURASSIC PARK , TRON , etc . - all whipped up into the narrative frenzy . It 's all backed with some great themes - the risk of survival , the loss of family and loved ones - but , sadly , the first hour only sticks to a marketable formula . Eventually , the high-tech facility becomes a decidedly low-tech castle , and our participants discover they 're not so much racing to prevent the extinction of man so much as they are trying to master some vivid video game brought to life by powers much more ` magical ' than they are ` scientific . 'That said , I 'm comfortable admitting that , had the writers and animated stuck hard and fast to the more scientific elements of KING OF THORN , they might 've had a winner here . It 's the risk of tinkering with adaptations - losing some of the author 's message in favor of presenting the entirety of the work - that bubbles to the surface here and tears the film in half . The latter half is repeatedly plagued by dreams and , then ( even worse ) , dreams within dreams ; from a stylistic standpoint alone , it 's hard to tell where each characters ' story begins and someone else 's ends . Moments that should 've been revelatory end up being vastly more confusing due to the finished product . It is n't until the ultimate ending that , as a viewer , you 're assured of what you just saw . While that may work for an episode of ` The Twilight Zone , ' it all feels loose , forced , and inadequate here.KING OF THORN is n't a total disappointment . Instead , it feels rushed and insignificant . I can only hope that manga on which it was based makes more sense.KING OF THORN was produced by Bandai Visual Company , Sunrise , Enterbrain Inc. , Dentsu , Kadokawa Pictures , Sony PCL , and TV Tokyo . DVD distribution is being handled by Funimation . It all looks and sounds pretty solid - I did experience some audio distortion in the second half that required me to turn up the levels a bit , but it was a minor inconvenience . The DVD comes with a handful of extras , including some press briefings , a director interview , and the usual assortment of trailers and TV spots . I did n't explore them , mostly because I found the film unsatisfying , but they 're there for the interested audience.RECOMMENDED only for serious fans of anime and/or manga as there 's really very little else here that would make sense to the average viewer . Some clever animation and storytelling trickery just is n't enough - or strong enough - to elevate KING OF THORN to a respectable adaptation . The last forty minutes becomes largely coherent - that is , until the ultimate ` reveal ' is revealed - making the viewing experience mostly an exercise in frustration . What starts out feeling an awful lot like ALIENS ends up feeling so ` alien ' itself that I 'm not sure some folks will even finish the disc , but , as they always say , it is what it is.In the interests of fairness , I 'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Funimation provided me with a DVD screener of KING OF THORN for the expressed purposes of completing this review ."}, "26783": {"id": "26782", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Not the greatest in the genre , but ok to have to add to collection .

I should 've quit ahead when the shark bursts through a surfboard ( cracking it in half ) and jumping 30ft into the air roaring . So a tsunami hits Australia and a grocery store during a robbery gets hit and floods partway , and when the survivors get together and try to figure out a way to the surface a big great white shark is stuck in the grocery store with them and terrorizes them . Sounds like a winning formula right ? Well it was pretty entertaining if you like shark attack movies , so the scenes with the shark and people avoiding the shark were sorta fun , but what was anything but good was the other 95 % , the human drama.We have a few different kind of characters in this movie . We have generic looking white heroes who say positive stuff like `` c'mon guys stop fighting , we need to get outta here '' and do almost everything themselves . We have the negative survivors that sit around and bitch saying stuff like `` We 'll never make it '' or `` why do n't we just give up now '' . Finally we have neutral martyrs that decide to help at the last minute and die , and are promptly forgotten about . Such is life of a neutral . A police-father in this has a leg injury and grabs one of the generic white kids by the shoulders and grunts `` help ... my ... daughter ... '' or a criminal-turned gruff good guy who says `` I 'm foindin ' us a way outta here '' . My point is the characters suck.Also by the end it turns out that the great white shark was also a part time relationship counselor : -a girl was in a relationship with a jerk , so the shark ate the jerk and let her and her dog live so that she can ponder why she chooses the men she does-An estranged ex-couple are brought back together when the well-meaning new boyfriend dies , and they would n't have likely sat down and talked if it were n't for the whole tsunami/great white situation-great white teaches one of the robbers that he does in fact have a heart of gold , and hooks him up with one of the store clerks while he 's at it ! Yowza ! -Also the shark teaches a selfish girl to be self-less by the end of it and appreciate her fellow man , as well as allowing her father to witness what a good person she 's becoming.Wow , move over Dr. Phil !

There were a total of six people in the movie theater . I told myself that it was probably because most people saw it opening weekend . However , after sitting through it , I think maybe word of mouth has slowed its progress . Despite the number of 5 star reviews the film has received here on Amazon , and the 92 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes , this may be the most overrated film ever . Recently , there was an article in Vanity Fair by James Wolcott in which he lamented the dearth of quality movies and the lowered expectations of many filmgoers ( presumably including film critics , themselves ) and praised the high quality of television 's current offerings . `` Cabin in the Woods '' , in my opinion , only reinforces his argument . Produced and co-written by Josh Whedon , `` Cabin '' is no `` Buffy , the Vampire Slayer '' , by any stretch of the imagination . More a combination of `` Evil Dead '' , `` Resident Evil '' , and `` Doctor Strangelove '' ( without the first and third film 's imagination ) , `` Cabin in the Woods '' tips its hat too early , whispering its little secret to us without completely spilling the beans , although many will have it figured out long before the ending , which feels cribbed from the ending of another film written by Drew Goddard , `` Cabin '' s co-writer and director . The writers have obviously also harvested some of the more esoteric internet conspiracy websites to gather some of their material.With the exceptions of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as two project managers , the actors are neither better nor worse than any others in movies of this genre . Chris Hemsworth ( `` Thor '' , `` The Avengers '' ) is the college jock who leads his small group to the titular cabin in the woods that allegedly belongs to his cousin . Enroute to the cabin , the group stops at a rundown gas station attended by the requisite nutjob -- think the nutty alcoholic in the original `` Friday the 13th '' film -- who drops ominous hints at what awaits them . Ignoring all this , the kids are n't at the cabin long before all sorts of horrors begin to unfold . But , as the film basically shouts from the beginning , THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS . Neither is it as surprising , innovative , or as interesting as it is given credit for being ( it 's really a lazy man 's movie that combines scenes from other movies and adds a little twist in order to appear to be more clever than it is ) . And , finally , the cinematography is often murky and the CGI effects are n't that impressive , either.In fact , if you 've ever played a video game , this movie is basically the same type of experience , only much less fun . At least that 's how it felt to me.I give `` Cabin in the Woods '' a star for its sometimes fleeting , loopy humor ( particularly in the performances of Jenkins and Whitford ) , and a star for the fact that it somewhat resists the temptation to get overly grotesque . Otherwise , there 's not much else to recommend it over a rerun of `` Buffy '' or `` Angel '' , which are free and about a hundred times more entertaining ."}, "26806": {"id": "26805", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This has got to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen .

So lets just start out by saying the movie in my opinion was terrible because everyone pretty much dies . So to the people who made the Wrong Turn Films let me start off by saying for the umteenth time THIS IS N'T THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING THE CANNIBALS/WEST VIRGINIA BACKWOODS HILLBILLIES KILLING EVERYONE DOES NOT MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE THE GOOD GUYS LIKE IT DID IN THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING WITH LEATHERFACE AND HIS FAMILY.Now with that being said lets start off by getting into the plot of this movie then comparing it to the epic failure 4th installment of the Wrong Turn movie sequence since it is the only other installment of the Wong Turn movies where everyone dies . The plot of this film is simple it takes place in a town known as Fair Lake located in Greenbrier County West Virginia home of everyones favorite backwoods redneck cannibal family . Fair Lake according to the plot is a town that was established in 1814 and de-established in 1817 because all the cannibals who were the first people on the land before it was a town establishment and before West Virginia ( originally part of Virginia ) was even established as a state ate everyone and turned Fair Lake West Virginia ( technically Fair Lake Virginia at the time ) into a ghost town . Basically every year outside the forest area of Fair Lake West Virginia there is a music festival known as the Mountain Man Festival and a group of 4 senior college kids and one college drop out ( Billy ) saying he 's taking a break from school for longer then 2 semesters even though his parents do n't know about it decide to camp out in the woods of Fair Lake West Virginia where the fearsome 3 sum of cannibals ( 3 finger , sawtooth , and one eye + Maynard ( the old man in the first 2 wrong turns ) live . After being set up in a trap designed to crash the college students car on their way to the music festival dug by the cannibals involving the college students camping out kicking Maynard . Right when the students are kicking Maynard after their car crashes from Maynard jumping in front of it when he 's down and the cannibals are getting ready to strike their prey , the Greenbrier County Sherif and a few deputies show up and take the kids along with Maynard to jail for assault ( mainly on Maynard ) and illegal possession of drugs on the college kids . And since Billy brought the drugs he takes full responsibility for them and the rest of the kids go to a near by motel . Then the sherif finds out Maynard is guilty of multiple killing crimes and when she tries to report him to a higher police authority through radio the cannibals shut off all the power in the jail and motel . Then Billy 's girl friend Cruz brings him supper and is followed by one of Billy 's college companions Julian . Cruz gets killed by 3 finger on her way and Julian gets to the jail where the Sherif deputizes everyone in the jail cels ( basically the 2 college kids + a drunk ) to hold down the fort and get Maynard to a more secure facility due to death threats involving the other 3 cannibals from Maynard.Now comparing Wrong Turn 5 to Wrong Turn 4.First off Wrong Turn 4 was a worse movie , at least Wrong Turn 5 did n't go take place in this past decade ( see prev review on Wrong Turn 4 ) even though it should have because Maynard is killed in the second Wrong Turn ( created in 2007 ) . And the makers of Wrong Turn 5 did n't go take out all the fun of allot of parts in the plot like they did in Wrong Turn 4 . The creators of the film do n't leave the viewer wondering how the cannibals got some of the things they did as they did in the fourth installment of Wrong Turn . Plus the cannibals in Wrong Turn 5 acted more like killers rather then sissies like they did in Wrong Turn 4 . The good guys in Wrong Turn 5 did n't blow off killing the cannibals when they had the chance like the did in the 4th installment since they never really got a chance at killing the cannibals . And at least Wrong Turn 5 Bloodbath/Bloodlines has a more suitable name and does n't look like a poser film to the first wrong turn like the 4th installment did.However everyone dies in Wrong Turn 5 just like they did in the 4th installment and that 's why it only gets one star . But if you do n't mind horror films where everyone dies and the bad guys win , you may like this movie even though it really should have taken place somewhere between 2004 & 2006 . However , in my opinion the creators of the Wrong Turn series of films with the 5th installment have shown pretty much a failure to make up for their god awful creation of the forth wrong turn , are getting pretty desperate for ideas , are starting to feel they should have left the wrong turn series at 3 films , and most importantly feeling like someone else needs to re-make their 4th and 5th installments of the Wrong Turn series . Just like the people who made Starship Troopers feel about the second and third films they made ( well I guess Starship Troopers 3 was n't really that bad ) . And just for the record , you can add a reporter , the sherif 's boyfriend , and a deputy to the list of people who are killed in this film ."}, "26825": {"id": "26824", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Maestro Chomsky , it is called either we try our best to rule the world or we will be ruled by some other governmental point of view on how to control global resources ."}, "26826": {"id": "26825", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Alas !

As for the aforementioned action sequences , do not expect them to be the sole redeeming quality : staged in warehouses or on the urban-generic streets of a city with no visible human population , they become monotonous in the worst way , a bland cycle of of smashed concrete and digital demon fireballs without notable choreography or even a hint of tension ."}, "26846": {"id": "26845", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Even though most of them flop , Hollywood just seems determined to cram the glossy , witless supernatural thrillers down our throats . Consider : & # 34 ; Legion , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Constantine , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Van Helsing & # 34 ; and everything & # 34 ; Underworld. & # 34 ; And at times , & # 34 ; I , Frankenstein & # 34 ; seems like a massive crossover fanfiction of all those -- we have demons , angels , an ancient feud between warring immortal factions , a conspiracy to bring the undead to life ... and gargoyles . It feels like a post- & # 34 ; Underworld & # 34 ; fanfic based on Mary Shelley -- cheesy , plodding and derivative , but it 's also oddly harmless.After burying his maker , the Frankenstein monster ( Aaron Eckhart ) is immediately caught in a clash between demons and the angelically-assisted gargoyles . The gargoyle queen Leonore ( Miranda Otto ) declares that his name is Adam , and asks him to help them save the human race from demons . He refuses , but grabs a sanctified weapon and starts sending the demons back to hell.Fast-forward to the modern day . Adam is still hunting for the demon prince Naberius ( Bill Nighy ) , who has begun scientific experiments to recreate Frankenstein 's revivification techniques -- and is hunting for the monster and/or Frankenstein 's notes . With one of those , he can unleash a new horde of demons on earth , which the dwindling gargoyle forces can not hold back. & # 34 ; I Frankenstein & # 34 ; feels like a massive crossover fanfic . The style is very much & # 34 ; Underworld , & # 34 ; the main plot and villain motivation are from & # 34 ; Van Helsing , & # 34 ; and the angel/demon thing somewhat reeks of & # 34 ; Legion. & # 34 ; And of course , the Frankenstein monster is a tortured , angsty soul with abs that you can grate cheese on , who is redeemed for love of a bland scientist he just met.There is a certain charm in the movie 's clear admiration for the original Mary Shelley novel , though . There are many nods ( Adam 's name ) and references to the book , rather than to the more famous monster movies loosely adapted from it.However , & # 34 ; I , Frankenstein & # 34 ; is still a mess . The wafer-thin plot manages to be both simplistic and overcomplicated , with no twists or hidden layers . So it loads itself down with glossy slow-motion action sequences and flashy CGI ( both gargoyles and demons expire in massive eruptions of light ) . The dialogue tends to be cheesy at best ( & # 34 ; Now all I see is darkness. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; I am not human , nor gargoyle , nor demon & # 34 ; ) , and whenever the action dies down , the story lapses into a plodding , awkward pace.Aaron Eckhart seems to be showing us how he would have played a Christopher Nolan Batman -- lots of brooding and angsting ( sometimes on rooftops ) , and talking in a gravelly monotone . He 's not giving it his all , but he 's putting more effort into it than the sleepwalking Nighty . Yvonne Strahovski is so blandly generic as a contrived love interest , she might as well be made of compressed Wonder Bread.Honestly , the only actor who seems to be really throwing herself into her roles is Miranda Otto , who puts a lot of trembling passion into her cheesy dialogue . God bless Otto , she 's working hard on this , and she does add some moments of much-needed subtlety. & # 34 ; I , Frankenstein & # 34 ; is a pretty bad movie that derived almost everything from other movies , but it does have a little sliver of heart that makes it hard to hate .

Small budget , big effects , cool aliens , terrific acting . Lots of action . You would think the writer/director of District 9 , given a chance at Hollywood resources , would blow you away . Well , he did n't . Instead , he gave us a propaganda film for the 99 % . But I knew that going in and figured I 'd still have a good time watching it . I did n't . I was bored . The movie is slow , action starved , and not very logical . Even the premise is a stretch -- the wealthy elite live in a ringworld-esque space station visible from Los Angeles with the naked eye . This space station would be the envy of anyone in the Star Trek or even Star Wars universes . And they have these Medical Bays that apparently can cure any sickness or disease . These bays look like tanning booths , and you can see the person in them while they 're being worked on , which only takes a few seconds . These machines can even reconstruct a blown-apart face through a process we 're given to assume is called re-atomization . Pretty impressive , huh ? And it 's all going to be available in 2154 . Just 140 years from now . So that 's the basis for the story : the uber rich , pretty people living in ringworld with their miracle health machine , and everyone else living in filth and poverty and sickness on the planet below . What happens is Matt Damon gets hit with a lethal dose of radiation , and his only salvation is to get into one of these machines . To do this , he must partner with , and do a favor for , a local gang leader geek warlord coyote type who seems to live above everyone else and who has a pretty good stock of high tech gadgets and weapons . The favor is that he needs to have Matt Damon download some programming from the head of Damon 's old boss , a guy who owns and manages a robot factory where Damon used to work and where Damon got his lethal dose of radiation . This download is to be done after Damon surgically acquires some cyborg prosthetics . Two subplots complicate or compound this A-story . The first involves an old girlfriend of Damon 's who ( of course , can you say plot device ? ) has a sick child with Leukemia , and the second has to do with Jodi Foster 's character plotting to overthrow the ringworld administrators . Btw , Jodi Foster speaks with the most bizarre accent in this movie . It 's actually quite jarring.So , what 's wrong with the picture ? Let 's count the ways . WARNING : Some Spoilers Follow1 . Damon works in this factory . It looks like a cross between a UPS shipping facility and a junk yard . The only clean place in the whole factory is where the boss stands and looks at computer screens . So , why are they irradiating robot parts ? I assume it 's to decontaminate them . But then why would you decontaminate them and then roll them back onto the same factory floor they came from ? 2 . The local warlord geek gang leader coyote has lots of resources . He has sophisticated weaponry , cyborg prostheses , lots of electronic stuff . He even has access to shuttles . Yeah , space shuttles . So why does n't he have one of the Medical Bays ? Would n't they be sort of a hot item on the black market ? 3 . Why build an enormous space station in low earth orbit ? Why not just buy Chile and live there ? Why would a space station be safe ? If you consider the direction space engineering is taking today , you see private enterprise and also smaller countries getting into the act . In 150 years , almost anyone will be able to shoot a rocket into space . A low Earth orbit space station visible with the naked eye from Los Angeles would be like hanging a water balloon on a tree limb at Camp BB Gun.4 . If you need to shoot down unauthorized shuttles trying to enter your space station , why do it with some guy on the ground using a bunch of shoulder fired missiles ? Why would n't a space station with a 1500 mile diameter have its own sophisticated defense system ? You mean to tell me , the defense of a multi-gazillion dollar space habitat depends on a single guy who lives in a rathole and does n't own a decent pair of clothes ? 5 . This is a future world in which intelligent robots serve as cops and a process knows as re-atomization can fix any known human disease or injury , where a space station has been built that looks like a modern version of Rome . Re-atomization ! Think about it . Scientists have figured out a way to create things at the atomic level . If you can re-atomize a human face and head in seconds , how long will it take to make a hot dog ? And why are people starving and living in filth on the planet ? This movie would make Gene Roddenberry roll over in his grave.Here 's what I think happened : The director failed to assert himself when the talking heads in Hollywood took control of the story and said to him : `` Do n't worry .

Sam Raimi and his friends got into the business by making The Evil Dead , a low-budget horror movie famous ( or infamous ) for pushing the boundaries . The movie is pretty raw . The story is fairly basic -- five 18-to-25 year-olds go to a cabin in the woods where they plan to have a lot of fun but unleash a demon who starts possessing and killing them one by one . The special effects were the best they could do on a low budget and work for the most part . The violence and gore and scares are so extreme that they sometimes become comic . Bruce Campbell 's over the top performance as Ash begins his amazing career . The movie became a cult hit and was also banned in Britain during the video nasties scare of the 1980s.Fast forward 30 years . A high-budget ( comparatively speaking ) remake is made with the backing of the original film 's producers . The story is mostly the same , except that the five young people come to the cabin to help one of them kick her drug addiction ( which helps explain why they do n't run away immediately when she tells them about the crazy evil things happening to her ) . The special effects are top-notch , to the fault of being too realistic . The violence and gore and scares are extreme but do n't cross the line into comedy . Jane Levy 's solid performance as going-cold-turkey Mia carries the viewer through the excruciating horror . The movie , while not a big hit , performed well enough at the box office to get a sequel greenlit.This movie has a lot of visual and audio references to the first film ( and its sequels ) , which is to be expected , but has nothing iconic of its own to offer . I liked the set-up which makes their reluctance to leave more plausible , though both this film and the earlier one show that escape is impossible regardless of the characters ' decisions . So the set up is a welcome but not necessary addition . The change in tone , losing the humor and the over-the-top rawness , is a big problem . Without the humor to buoy up the viewer , the gore gets too grim and unbearable . The realistic depiction of the gore does n't help . When Bruce Campbell cuts his evil hand off in Evil Dead II , the filmmakers play up the ridiculousness of what 's happening ( at the end the hand goes scurrying away like Thing from The Addams Family ) . A similar scene in this film has a woman ( not Mia ) chopping most of her arm off with an electric kitchen knife , but it 's just an unpleasantly realistic-looking experience -- gore for its own sake , which is repulsive in every possible sense . Mia 's plight is pitiable but truly unpleasant . Perhaps there 's heroism in her survival to the end but watching the movie is more like a forced march than a triumphant arrival .

It 's almost as if they were hired solely to promote the film . The good news is that it is very gory . The bad news is that they do n't take it to the next level . This is not the cabin in the woods I was expecting . The Evil Dead was legendary as a horror film . I can still connect with the original or sequel ( you do n't see that camera work everyday ) . It 's so much fun and scared the wits out of people in the 1980s ( it was the # 1 movie rented in more than one country for at least a year ) . It revolutionized the demonic POV shots that grab you . The remake is fairly loyal to the original storyline . It unfolds almost exactly the same way with different camera work and actors . Some of the best elements of the original are here ( e.g . the perverted pencil and basement zombie ) but they just seem inserted and not crucial to the plot.Ultimately the remake does n't offer more story or character development and is much less memorable . It could have been amazing with Raimi 's involvement . After all , he made some awesome movies on a low-budget and then became a big success in Hollywood so he has learned so much since the 1980s . Yet he handed the directorial reins over to Fede Alvarez . The teens show up in an isolated cabin before the dead come to life . My main complaints are the acting , props , story and CGI . The cast is mostly forgettable . The acting featured one atrocious scene that reminded me of The Ring . This actress in a blue screen was whispering while surrounded by zombies with the music blaring full-blast . The scene either did n't support her , she was in the wrong movie or she simply lacked direction . The prop for the Necronomicon ( Book of the Dead ) was rather lame . I 'm not sure many demonologists use red magic markers to write in an ancient , priceless manuscript when they want a spell on summoning the dead . The CGI hollows out this movie to the point where so much is happening that you ca n't connect with the characters or action . This Blu-ray has about 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary ( Director Fede Alvarez , co-writer Rodo Sayagues , Jane Levy , Lou Taylor Pucci , Jessica Lucas ) .

It was creepy and errie . Here is reduced to lasting all about a few minutes and once it `` possesses '' the main girl , it never shows up again . Um , what ? Then they remove any potential humor from the film . Let 's face it-the entire Evil Dead franchise had a sense of humor , with total overuse of squirting blood , to crawling hands , etc . The morons playing the tape while one girl is like `` shut it off . '' They did n't even play a tape , this random guy thinks it 's a good idea to read English translations ? Um ... it would 've been better if this guy was a student in a Latin class and read it , but in English ? It 's like a film that cuts every corner to try to be different , only to turn out to be stale . The basement in this movie is so foul , way more than the original , and yet , it is horribly underused.The `` forest is alive and ready to do bad things '' scene is done we 'll , yet is also underwhelming . It 's kind of sad thinking they basically had to play with trees to get this to work in the original , and here there is obvious CGI.The original `` Evil Dead '' really had something going for it , even with the bad special effects . The particular ending scene where Bruce Campbell aka `` Ash '' undoes the curse and the demons break out of the people with the hands could 've really added some much needed pizazz to this film , but it 's absent.The movie also seems half-written for one direction and another direction , considering it can not even figure out whom the main character is . First it 's the girl , then it 's her boyfriend , but somehow the girl is saved ? I mean , why ? Just let everyone die who is cursed , the beginning of the film pretty much said that , yet the film does n't even follow through on it 's own story .

But it had a lot more going for it . It was daring in it 's depiction of gore and violence for the time of it 's release . It was also atmospheric , and actually often pretty scary . There were weaknesses involved due to it 's incredibly low budget , but the film worked . It 's a classic . For me personally it did have one weakness , and that was the cheesy robotic demon voices . I saw the Evil Dead when it first hit theaters back in the early 80 's and loved it but thought the silly robot-like demon voices were stupid . Other than that the film was a truly great horror film . I also did a smirk and said 'Pfft '' when it happened in this version as well , as I shook my head left to right and laughed at the silly and hokey feel of it . It 's what I did n't like about 'Drag me to Hell ' as well- When that robot demon opens it 's mouth so many years later , once again.Evil Dead II on the other hand while sometimes being the equal of the first film , ended up delving into slapstick humor , and that ruined it for me . So I did not like the idea of turning what started off as moody solid and often terrifying horror into a some kind of silly comedy . That made no sense to me . It 's the same reason I disliked Army of Darkness even more . To me it was like taking the demonic Exorcist theme and mixing it with Jason and the Argonauts and adding in slapstick humor . I did not get it . So just saying ahead of time , I am not one of the followers of the series . I did not like any of the series but the first film . But yes , I did love the first Evil Dead movie ... .But what about this remake ? Well I had a lot of issues with it in all honesty . Firstly , at least the version I rented online does not contain a couple of scenes I noticed in the trailers . One being the girl chained in the cellar sticking her face out of the opening of the door and singing a creepy little number . I was waiting for that but it never came . Second issue is that of the trailer . It 's better than the movie is . If you see the trailer it leaves you expecting far more than the movie delivers . Another issue I had was the typical very familiar formula of young college aged kids stuck out in the woods . Nothing wrong with that , except here the treatment offers too many familiar elements and nothing what so ever that is refreshing or original . It feels like too many other horror films with a similar tagline and locations.Yet another issue is that when this remake follows the original Evil Dead it fails to outdo or even match the effectiveness of the same material done much better and with more style and substance in the original . It just does the job , but without really grabbing you at all . Yet another thing that bothered me is that there is every reason in the world to expect great things to happen . Location is typical but good , the sets look creepy enough , but none the less the atmosphere and tension seems rather lite to the touch . It 's just not very thick convincing or all that great.The gore comes in about half way through and there is a certain satisfying feeling about it , and it 's done very well . In fact it does n't particularly feel non-unique . It actually works pretty well . And then later on when the gore get 's deep and truly over the top it seems done intentionally , seemingly to squeeze a rather otherwise uneventful film for everything they could at the last minute . When the movie get 's extremely gory it really get 's very gory . And even die-hard gore fans should be satisfied with that aspect of the movie . But in the end I found my self flicking my wrist at the TV and blowing out a rather snoring annoyed exhale as I said under my breath `` Oh please ... . another crappy movie that promised much more that it delivered '' , while shaking my head left to right with a little lip music that soon followed.For what it is the movie turns out to be generally entertaining in a very non- rewarding typical way . The film also feels pretty typical of the usual horror movies of late . Could have been much better , and the over the top reviews and over zealous add campaigns did n't help . The film is not the match of the original , and it 's not even half as good . But if you love gore for the sake of gore the last half of the film should do the job . Otherwise I 'd skip on this one . It 's not all that scary , and pretty much the kind of thing we 've all seen too many times to even care to count any longer ."}, "26917": {"id": "26916", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I gave evil dead two stars because i love the beginning but the movie really dies after and looses me.The family issued in this movie is not interesting one bit and why would the brother bring his sister to the woods for her as some sort of rehab , thats why there are rehab places out there.This remake is more like a soap opera then a horror movie and i was bored out of my mind watching it.I love blood guts gore and i love the original and i do like some remakes hill have eyes was a great remake and hill have eyes two is also a good movie and way better then this boredom remake.Skip this crappy movie"}, "26918": {"id": "26917", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I admire any horror film that has the balls to put `` The Most terrifying film you will ever experience '' in large print on its poster . Talk about guts . That includes being scarier than The texas chainsaw massacre , the exorcist , psycho , alien , and even the original Evil Dead : which offered satisfying scares and launched the careers of the talented Sam Raimi and cult-favorite Bruce Campbell . Raimi ( who produced this reboot ) often said that if he had a bigger budget , the film would have been the scariest ever made . After seeing this new Dead , I 'm starting to question that viewpoint.Evil Dead comes armed with the special effects Raimi always dreamed of , and enough blood , limbs , and guts that no gore hound will leave thirsty . But there 's also something dry about this movie . There 's no personality . The original had all the gore , scares and laughs any h-fan could wish for , but what set it apart from other horror films was its charisma . This new `` Evil Dead '' has none of that . Bruce Campbell 's chin alone has more charm.After last year 's `` Cabin in the woods , '' I thought big-budget scary movies would have been more hesitant to using stock characters . Yet here they all are in one convenient movie : You have your ditzy blonde chick , your heroic jock type , the know-it-all dweeb , etc . The best character here is Mia ( Jane Levy ) , a drug addict who 's decided to go `` cold turkey . '' But even she is written as just another excuse to drive the plot along . The writers could 've made an inspired parallel between drug addiction and demonic possession here , but they seem more interested in giving pointless exposition . The original dead never bothered with such . It knew that telling the occupations for every character or why the demons were attacking wasnt necessary . Too bad this dead is the exact opposite , at every turn we have Eric ( the dweeb ) explaining in detail why the demons are possessing their friends . Is the fact that they 're demons not reason enough ? And did I mention these characters were stupid ? I mean really stupid . I 'm not saying that the characters from the original were geniuses or anything , but they are compared to these idiots : When Eric discovers the Book of the dead , he is told specifically by the book not to read a passage out loud . What does he do ? He not only reads the book out loud , he also scribbles in it with pencil . Who invited this guy ? Some horror fans will enjoy `` Evil Dead . '' The effects get the job done and , as another reviewer said , since there is n't a clear `` Ash '' we never know who 's going to live or die . The problem is I was never given a reason to care . The director focused so much on special effects that he forgot everything else that makes great horror films work : Slow build up , never show the monster in the first five minutes , likable characters , and most importantly , it should never be boring . 20 minutes into this film I felt disappointed , after 40 disinterested , and near the end the impossible happened . I was watching a girl screaming and running from a demon in a storm of raining blood , and I was bored.I never took the tag-line seriously , but now I wish the movie would 've borrowed some of its audacity.Pros : Special effects are well-done , a few jump scares.Cons : Script is weak , acting wooden , repetitive , stupid characters"}, "26919": {"id": "26918", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "characters got ta be smarter .

And there 's electricity and running water ( how does that happen in a remote/abandoned cabin ) , clean rug on the floor ( who cleans the place ) . Set designer did not do the best job ; there should have been dust and grime everywhere ( there looked to be a handwritten diary with pristine pages , not even yellowed with age - maybe one of the characters brought it with them , maybe I just missed that ) . the writer missed a great opportunity to connect with the audience by not having characters discuss it ; I mean , having them being put to work and complaining would have worked , but no cobwebs , no mice ( in the middle of the forest ) , not believable . I know the lead was kicking the habit , not strong enough plot point or well enough presented in the story to have characters remain there . this group would have retired post-haste to the nearest Holiday Inn , drug habit or no drug habit ( and I know writer was pushing that they were there for the heroine , but he did n't craft his story well enough , should have had at least one character mutter something alluding to the sacrifice her friends were making by staying in such a dump ) .

Almost.The key difference between `` III '' and the first two installments is that there is never a single moment in the film when the three characters played by Bradley Cooper , Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis seem happy to be together . In the first two films , there was at least the possibility of a good time at the bachelor party each film begins with . This moment helps illustrate their friendship and gives us a reason to go on these harrowing journeys with them . Yes , things go horribly wrong , but in the beginning , they are happy and excited . In `` III '' , the reason for their trip is very different and they all seem to dread the very idea of the journey which does n't help the film get off to a good start.In `` III '' , Alan ( Galifianakis ) has not been taking his meds leading to even more erratic behavior than in the previous films . When his actions lead to a pretty irresponsible , unsettling event , his family decides to have an intervention and Phil ( Cooper ) , Stu ( Helms ) and Doug ( Justin Bartha ) agree to drive Alan to a rehab facility in Arizona . On the way , Marshall ( John Goodman ) , a gangster , has his men run the friends off the road . He takes Doug as a hostage and will return him if the other three find Chow ( Ken Jeung ) , who has just escaped from a Thai prison . Chow stole $ 20 million in gold bars from the gangster and he wants it back . They hit the road and travel from Arizona to Tijuana before finally ending up back in Vegas . Along the way , they get into dangerous situations , people get hurt and killed , animals die , all in the pursuit of finding the gold and returning it . These situations are n't inherently funny and even the cast and crew seem to realize this because everything is played straight , leading to a bad impression of an action film.Seriously , the only person who even seems to be attempting something funny is Galifianakis . He takes the man-child character he always plays to familiar places , places already explored with much more energy and vitality by John Candy , Jim Belushi , Chris Farley and others . This type of humor is , for me , best served in small doses . When the character and behavior are prevalent throughout the entire film , everything in the narrative seems dumb , just dumb , not smart-funny dumb . It is much harder to do smart-funny dumb , which is why we so seldom see it , and why so many comedies are completely forgettable.Cooper and Helms grimace and frown their way through the entire film . And they have a right to , because they are in one dangerous situation after another . Hopefully , the large sequel-sized paycheck each received made up for this unpleasant experience . But what about our unpleasant experience ? Who will pay us ? We have to pay to sit and watch this dreck . That seems backward somehow.I find it hard to believe that director Todd Phillips envisioned these films as a trilogy ; when the first one made so much money , the plans for II and III were born . The phenomenal success of the first led to a virtual copycat set in a different country . Now , with the `` Epic Conclusion '' , he changes the format of the film . Initially , this is a welcome idea - `` II '' was a hollow retread of the first film - but why make this film at all if you ca n't figure out a way to incorporate , in some way , the original idea ? Basically , the only connection between the three films is the characters . Everything in this film happens moving forward , so the initial shock of seeing an outrageous moment and then learning about the circumstances leading up to it is gone . I suppose Alan killing a giraffe and the aftermath of this situation is meant to stand in for the bachelor party scene , but it is simply shocking and grimace-inducing . It just is n't funny.Phillips is a mixed bag as a director . He 's done some good films ( `` Old School '' , `` The Hangover '' ) but most of his films are jaw-droppingly bad.The road trip element of the story allows the narrative to return to Vegas and bring back some of the memorable characters from the first film ; the boys visit Heather Graham 's character at her new home . Her former hooker is now leading a respectable life with a new husband . The inclusion of this scene is just bizarre . It really is n't needed which leads to the question `` why is it included ? '' To give all of Heather Graham 's fans another look ? Does she even have fans anymore ? So the scene is not only unnecessary but boring.How bad does a movie have to be when even Melissa McCarthy is n't funny ? McCarthy pops up in a cameo . This is the first time I have not laughed at one of her cameos or performances . Her character is simply mean which is supposed to be a mirror image of Alan 's treatment of others , but that does n't work either . A mirror image of something that does n't work is also something that does n't work.There are a number of incidents involving animals . In each , the animal is drugged , harmed or killed . Is this supposed to be funny ? I think it is sort of sad . Everytime an animal pops up , something happens to them . In the other two films , animals make appearances and the level of harm played out on these creatures throughout the series seems gratuitous and out of proportion . Were the animals actually harmed during the filmmaking ? No . But depicting these moments as ` comedy ' just seems wrong . Very wrong.When the story finally gets to Vegas , the three men regard the opportunity to revisit the iconic city with palpable dread . They eventually learn that Chow is holed up in a penthouse at Caesar 's Palace . Alan refers to the resort as a ` hell-hole ' . When they finally make it to the hotel , there is an extended sequence featuring acrobatics from the penthouse . My question is : Did Las Vegas and Caesar 's Palace partner with the producers to make this film ? Neither is painted in a very positive light . If you had your product featured in a film and someone referred to it as a ` hell-hole ' would you be happy ? It might very well seem like an awful place to the characters , but none of this is remotely funny and seems like a stupid waste of time.And on that note , I do n't want to waste any more of our time on a movie that is essentially a complete waste of time ."}, "26956": {"id": "26955", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I can & # 8217 ; t believe someone finically backed this movie .

However , the story could have been told in its entirety within about 5 minutes , with very little dialogue , and much of that dialogue awkward and phoned in , in terms of writing . The second star I gave it was for the visuals . Much of the aesthetic is downright breathtaking , or at least would be were it not unabashed , ten-yards-behind-cutting-edge CGI . All told , this film is summed up ideally by the trailer : computer-generated monsters ( totaling 5 species , 4 of which are shown therein ) and Will and Jaden Smith playing themselves on a lean weekend ."}, "26962": {"id": "26961", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "A very poor film for me .

All you will need is a `` smart suit '' to keep you going , unless of course the temperature drops below zero . But , why quibble with such details , M. Night Shyamalan and Will Smith seemed to turn this entire project over to young Jaden . It 's a coming out party essentially , a whimsical blend of the sci-fi films Jaden apparently likes , plus a nod to Moby-Dick , which it seems he had to read in school.The story could have just as easily been set in Alaska or the High Sierra with father and son on a camping trip , menaced by an over-sized grizzly bear . Father and son could have communicated with walkie-talkies or mobile phones as the son had to seek help on his own due to his father being too weak to move . Instead , we get a kind of post-apocalyptic earth that appears to be a throwback to an earlier Cenozoic era with over-sized condors , saber-toothed lions and simian troops.There is kind of a nice moral to the movie about conquering fear . I suppose a big white whale seemed like a good analogy to the over-sized insect known as Ursa in this film , although that was n't what Moby-Dick was about . You knew what was coming long before it happened . There was surprising no tension in this film . The only thing mildly disconcerting were the flashbacks . There certainly is n't any far-reaching philosophical narrative as there was in Moby-Dick , just your standard survival tale set on Earth some 1000 years into the future long after human kind ceased to be part of the picture ."}, "26964": {"id": "26963", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Boring , no depth .

I 'll just go straight to the critiques . For those that have n't watched the movie , I 'll try to censor the spoilers : Pros : - A lot of people felt Jaden Smith 's acting to be not so good , but I thought most of the scenes that he was in was okay ( in other words ... I was expecting it , especially after seeing the Karate Kid which I did n't like either ) . I see some improvement in his acting and I too wish he would one day become as talented as his father . I 'm a Will Smith fan and I mainly watched this movie for Will Smith but I was willing to give his son a chance . I understand that Will Smith is trying hard to give his son a strong chance in the acting career , he 's doing everything a father can do to give his kids the leverage that they need . He loves his family and he 's doing what he can and I admire that . Being a bystander , sometimes we are quick to criticize him of stuff like nepotism but he 's a father that 's a famous actor , what did you expect ? Any father would probably do the same.- I 'm not yet much of a Jaden Smith fan , but seeing him in this movie definitely made me think of Will Smith and there were scenes where I did feel that charismatic presence coming from his son . I do n't think his son will be as fun to watch as his father but I hope he proves me wrong.Cons : - I 'm going to flat out and say I blame this film 's mediocrity not on Jaden Smith but on M. Night Shyamalan . I think most of M. Night 's movies are overrated.- The narration with Jaden Smith in the beginning did n't feel right . His voice moves me AWAY from the movie.- The trailer shows pretty much all the action scenes . Many times I feel like the person that made the trailer should be the person that makes the movies , it 's just so much more exciting . The better the trailer and/or the more action scenes they show in the trailer , the more you expect the film to be not so great . They 're desperate for advertisement that they 're basically throwing everything good about the movie into the trailer to hype up the potential moviegoers.- The planet that they land on , do n't expect a world you have n't seen before , or creative interesting sci fi creatures . Eagles , lions , apes , even the plant life . Only the Ursa is different from the rest and even they 're not that creative ( they look like what you see in Lord of the Ring ) . This was one big reason why I was disappointed . I was expecting a fantasy world , but pretty much everything that 's seen in the trailer is everything you 'll see in the movie pretty much.- SPOILER ALERT thereisascenewhereheisalmostfrozenaftertheraftscene . And he gets saved by an eagle that is smart enough to drag him into a hole and then cover up the hole with foliage AND THEN spread itself out over the spot in order to keep Kitai ( Jadan ) alive ? Yeah F right haha ... why would the eagle also remain on the ground and not fly off with Kitai instead ? - Alright we just have to bring up the Ursas . The blind creatures that can smell human pheromones when humans are scared . The movie does n't really explain what made them such a threat to human kind . They 're just introduced as large creatures that smell human fear and go after them , but they do n't look special or anything . Cypher Raige ( Will Smith ) took out one with one swipe to the throat , they did n't seem special . The movie just does n't elaborate on it . Also , if they can smell human fear that comes off our bodies , what about people in another room or people in suits that are airtight ? I 'm just watching the movie and it makes no sense as to why they 're so fearful . Giant monsters ... got it.- Will Smith 's part is lacking in this movie , you can tell he tries to leave the significant parts to his son . Will Smith 's acting is also toned down , not sure exactly why but it did n't capture me like it usually does ( or maybe I just was n't in the mood or something ) .There are other complaints but I 'll leave it here , the main ones are covered I believe . The story is slow , the acting kept me away from being absorbed into the movie , and the planet that they crash landed and how boring it was down there left me very unsatisfied .

Produced by the Christopher Nolan , written by David Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder ( 300 , Watchmen ) , it 's an attempt to bring the moral ambiguity and 'grittiness ' of Nolan and Goyer 's Dark Knight trilogy of Batman films to the Superman franchise , and set up a new shared universe of films based on DC comics characters.Things start promisingly with a visit to Krypton , depicted as something between Avatar ( the Cameron movie ) and Dune , with a mixture of ultra-advanced technology and feuding nobles . Russell Crowe plays Jor-El , here depicted as a scientist trying to save his world from imminent destruction but , in typical Russell Crowe style , is also capable of laying waste to entire platoons of soldiers single-handedly . Crow runs afoul of Michael Shannon 's General Zod during a coup but still manages to blast his infant son ( eventually a capable and reasonably good Henry Cavill ) into space before the planet explodes . Zod and his cohorts are sentenced to eternal imprisonment in the Phantom Zone , which works out about as well as it ever does.The infant Kal-El arrives on Earth and is found and raised by Kent family near Smallville , Kansas . Kal-El aka Clark 's crazy powers and abilities soon manifest and his human parents ( ably played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane ) are soon spending their time running around quashing rumours that their son is a space alien and instilling him with noble human values . Clark attempts to lie low in a number of fairly innocuous jobs but his tendency to rush into dangerous situations to rescue people soon attracts the attention of a reporter , Lois Lane ( Amy Adams ) . Clark discovers a Kryptonian ship which he can use with technology from his own crashed vessel to create an interactive AI based on his father 's personality . This allows him to learn about his heritage , but also sends out an automated SOS which lures Zod and his crazy crew to the planet . Cue a lot of carnage as showdown follows showdown until the film climaxes.The storyline is , in principle , a good idea . The film avoids any mention of Lex Luthor or Kryptonite , and the use of Krypton , Zod and Jor-El as an AI are all good notions that give the story a personal investment for Superman whilst allowing the origin story part of the narrative to flow into the actual present-day storyline . Unfortunately , this does n't work out in practise . The film 's first hour , just under half the total running time , is overwhelmed by backstory and exposition . The Krypton sequences with Russell Crowe are pretty good , with a strong visual identity and Crowe - easily the best performer in the movie - doing some excellent work , grounding the fantastical landscapes and events in more relatable issues of family . Michael Shannon is a bit thuggish and lacking in nuance as Zod ( especially as the film goes on and he gets more shouty ) , but he has credible motivations and presence . The Krypton sequence is imaginative and involving , but also overlong.Once on Earth , the film becomes a confused morass of flashbacks ( many of them pretty pointless ) and present-day story . Kevin Costner is very good as Superman 's human father , right up until he gets what is , by a considerable distance , the stupidest , most pointless and most unconvincing death scene in the history of cinema . The overwhelming stupidity of this sequence , not to mention that it was completely unnecessary , may be the film 's lowest point . Some individual sequences such as Superman saving the crew of an oil rig or learning to fly by first jumping really high ( a nod to early versions of the character who could n't fly at all , only jump miles at a time ) are much more successful . Amy Adams 's Lois Lane , who soon enters the story , is also really good . She plays Lois as a smart , intelligent reporter in her thirties who is more plausible than other takes on the character . Crucially , she is also aware of who Superman is from the off . This is an obviously different take on the character relationship , avoiding the whole 'wears glasses as a disguse ' cliche , even if it makes no sense whatsoever ( Perry meets Superman but later falls for the old 'glasses ' trick hook , line and sinker ) . But still , points for trying on that score . More disappointing is that Adams and Cavill do n't really have much chemistry , and their eventual romance is utterly unconvincing.The film continues to try hard to succeed : Zod 's plans for Earth are actually somewhat logical and make sense . They also give hope to Clark that one day Krypton can live again , which should lead to greater moral confusion over what is the right thing to do . But this never happens : Clark decides early on to defend Earth no matter the cost and never budges from that , making these attempts to complicate things fail outright.This leads into the film 's climactic action sequences which are , on the whole , highly disappointing . The action sequences are over-indulgent and seem to go on forever . They also frequently lack context or conviction : seeing two invulnerable beings fight one another knowing they ca n't hurt one another makes for zero tension . The CGI is also flat-out terrible in these battles , rather bafflingly since Krypton is so impressive at the start of the film . The character-replacement CGI is unconvincing , the placing of the actors ' faces on CGI bodies is amateurish and some of the flight and movement CGI is worse than the twelve-year-old original Spider-Man movie . Usually in 2013 the very least you can say about an otherwise terrible movie is that the effects are good , but Man of Steel ca n't even manage that right . The final battle also indulges in some dubiously lingering shots of collapsing skyscrapers with hundreds of people in them ( or about to be squashed by them ) which makes for uneasy viewing in a Superman feature.Man of Steel ( ** ) shows hints of a fertile imagination and originality ( mostly in the opening act set on Krypton ) whilst showcasing a few good performances , but these are soon buried by inane dialogue , terrible action sequences , poor CGI and a total collapse in logic at several key points in the film . Man of Steel is not only not very good , but even manages to make Superman Returns look like a capable and competent film in comparison . Overall , not recommended ."}, "26982": {"id": "26981", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Probably the worst Superman movie ever , and it 's a shame .

This movie is a mess , it attempts to deliver an origin story for Superman but the problem is that we never connect to Clark as a character . The first chunk of the movie takes place on Krypton , a location that in all honesty does n't matter because it explodes , the only reason Krypton is shown is because A ) Avatar was popular , let 's show an Avatar-esque world and B ) Thor was popular and that took place in part in an alien world so let 's show another world 's culture . The problem was this is a Superman movie and at the 30 minute mark we still know nothing about Clark.In fact even by the big moment in the movie when Clark flies for the first time we have a problem in that we still do n't know who Clark is as a person . We saw him as a child , and we see him get punched and then destroy a trucker 's livlihood in retaliation , so we know two things : Clark wants to save some people and Clark is petty . The next problem is that his father sent him from Krypton so he 'll have a choice , but as soon as he meets his father 's ghost he says something to the effect of `` this is what you should do . '' So Clark then has no choice.Ok got it.So at no point in the movie do we get to see Clark as a person , he 's an emotionless beast who does nothing and even when he does show himself he 's simply too cocky to have any personality other than that of a jerk . Who then is the main character ? Is it Amy Adams ? Well I mean she is the one we learn the most about but even she is barely deveolped as a character , instead she somehow is brought into any and every situation for no reason.So here 's the next problem . Superman gets his power from earth 's atmosphere right ? The Kryptonians get their power from Earth 's atmosphere . Why then can these characters jump far and run fast even when they have their suits on ? It 's the atmosphere but that only gives them xray vision and laser eyes ... Why then do they want to terraform earth ? Would n't they want to be superhuman ? Leave earth alone and kill the people then live as GODS.Ok , logic problems aside let 's look at the `` story '' any origin story should follow the basis of the heroes journey , this is just how it works . Superman has an awful heroes journey because we do n't know who he is .

They have destroyed so many of the nice and righteous parts of our culture by rewriting them or `` rebooting '' them . This is another sad example of how the soulless Hollywood machine can no longer express any goodness . Everything , even Superman is flawed , gray and unattractive . Nothing can be simply brave and true and simple anymore . They think that 's progress . They do n't see that it 's actually digression . Sad.Superman over the last 76 years has stood as a fictional symbol of simplicity , goodness ... . well , as he used to say : `` truth , justice and the American way . '' Now we see the media machine pumping out a driveling , pathetic self pitying little floppy haired pouty boy as the `` Man of Steel '' . It is interesting that as American itself does n't any longer stand for truth and justice , neither does it 's central comic book symbolic hero . The whole altruistic good vision is gone from the minds of our movie makers . They 've lived too long in a gray shadowed existence in their all too real world of corporate compromise . Gone are the days of simple good male character finding their way onto the silver screen . And when they do come back they are changed beyond recognition . The saddest thing about this is that the younger generation will just eat this up and think that this Emo-Superdud is what this character is ! Here 's some annoyances you 'll have to swallow if you decide to torture yourself with this movie : ( 1 ) Krypton is failing because of their environmentally unsound industrial practices . Oh my . How obvious can the brainwashing agenda be ? ! ? ! Ca n't they just make a movie anymore ! ? ! Or does it all have to be some sort of message device , a soap box ? When I pay to be entertained I am not paying to be preached at yet again about how terrible we are to the planet . Guilt guilt guilt . O.k. , I feel crappy about using fossil fuels , now what ? I ca n't just watch a Superman movie for an hour or two and then get back to the guilt after that ? No . Ca n't we just watch a freakin ' comic book movie and have a little fun ? No . No you ca n't . Everything must be on message . Uh ... such a waste . Inevitably all these dvd 's need to be thrown in the dumpster . ( 2 ) Do n't worry though ... if you like being preached at they 've got more for you . Old self-pitying Superbrat needs to save the off shore oil rig from itself in a big explosion scene . At least this stops his super-poutying teenage angst for a minute or two . But again , can these soulless Hollywood types think their own thoughts at all . No . They saw oil spills on the news and it was getting ratings and so they thought that was a good idea . Preachy and transparent . I really dislike movies that are n't really what they 're supposed to be and are actually about getting bullet points or messages into the audience . Again , I thought I was buying a comic book movie . ( 3 ) This may seem small , but to the Superman fan it is not . It 's a detail but I 've always thought them smart to avoid . The scruff , the beard , shaving . In almost all Superman movies and tv , they avoid this issue , very wisely I think . What on the planet can he shave with . Bullets literally bounce off his pupils , so what does he shave with ? Almost all other directors and producers cared just enough about the suspension of disbelief enough to avoid this issue . These filmmakers thought it more important to make him look cool or dramatic than to make the character make sense . Again , if you 're not really a comic book person , sci-fi fan , or Superman buff , you might think this point silly , but it is not . ( 4 ) Krypton . Originally it simply died of old age . It was vague way back when . But it is clear that there was no rebellion or internal war . It is so pathetic that Hollywood has to take a place of enlightened higher level beings and lower them down , not only to our brutal human level , but to this very moment of war and brutality . No longer is Superman and his race a dream or ideal of an advanced species we might try to be like , no longer are we in awe of their peace and beauty . No , they are dumb and warlike like us . Great right ! Do n't you just identify with them so much more now that they can not focus on the environmental issues tearing their planet apart because they 're too busy killing each other . Is n't it great that they 're just like us ? These stupid filmmakers think people tune into Superman to see ourselves ! ! ! ! ! No , Superman is supposed to be an ideal , not a reflection of our own inadequacies . ( 5 ) We can get into Zod and all the rewriting if you like , but let 's just cut to the chase : they have no ideas in their manikin heads out there in Southern California . Everything is a pale rewrite of some previous material . They can not simply pick Superman up where the last movie left off and writing from there . No , they have to retell the beginning because they have no original thoughts.All the media machine can do is regurgitate the same plots ... each time releasing it with more bile left all over the product than the last time . So we have to use Superman II ideas . We have to retell the beginning of Superman I . And we have to puke it up through the ugly and contorted lens of our modern gray minds . They 've forgotten what good looks like . They 've forgotten how think , and apparently they do n't seem to hire those people ... what are they called ... . oh , it 's been so long since we 've seen one ... oh , yeah they 're called writers . `` Re-writers '' seem to fit the bill just fine.Note to any Hollywood `` writers '' out there : If someone asks you to take an old idea that was good and touch it , rewrite it , or otherwise make it palatable for the modern audience , you should remember that you 're a artist not an office secretary . Artists create , they do not destroy other people 's creations and call themselves artists . No one calls themselves a painter when they 've painted a new Mona Lisa . We call them forgers.I mean , this movie is an amalgam of pop culture hot words : terraforming , oil spill , coup d ' & eacute ; tat , military investigation , genetic engineering ... blah , blah , etc . Tiring , obvious soap box big media messaging , wrapped in a flesh of a childish unmanly super-emo-man , who 's self doubt and pity are pathetic.This is certainly not Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster 's Superman . You actually like that guy.Max Fleischer 's Superman would not understand this movie at all . He lived in a different time , a simpller time , when good was obvious and Superman was a symbol of strength . Period.George Reeves ' Superman was like your ideal , strong , caring , dad figure compared to this super-brat , who is like your wimpy , video game playing , pouty teenage emo son.And Finally , Christopher Reeves ' likable , kind , simply , strong , bold , loving and brave Superman would simply shake his head and feel sorry for this pathetic little thing . Christopher as a human was immensely more charismatic , and as an actor was , well , a good actor ! You believed he was Superman . And finally , you liked him . And you like Superman . You wanted to be like him , and as a parent , you did n't mind your child wanting to be like him.I do not think Man of Steel is appropriate for small children the way almost all other Superman series were . I certainly do n't want my son to be like this guy.I 'd suggest passing on this movie . I wish I could give it zero stars.It 's the worst Superman anything ... ever.Finally , Superman does not kill . He is supposed to be a good person . Period . Therefore , this is not Superman . So sad , so very , very sad ..."}, "26994": {"id": "26993", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Superman does not -- through inaction -- allow someone to die .

I guess this movie could be awesome and worth watching if you had never watched a real Superman movie or were just born yesterday ."}, "26999": {"id": "26998", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Good actors .
