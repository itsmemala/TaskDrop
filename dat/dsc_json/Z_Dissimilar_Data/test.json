Without giving too much away , the characters have been throw into a new setting and most of the season shows them trying to cope with the changes . The humor remains similar to previous seasons . The episodes do follow a much more linear storyline , vs the stand-alone episodes of the past that were only loosely connected to each other . Missing an episode in season 5 will make things confusing down the road , something that was not true in previous years.If you enjoyed Archer season 1-4 , 5 is definitely worth picking up .

I 'll update this later after more people have seen the episode . The main change is n't a well-kept secret , but I 'd rather not spoil it for anyone who does n't know yet . I 'm sure other people will explain what 's happening , and I 'll add to this then.So for now , please forgive the short review and just know that Archer is still the AWESOME show it has been , completely different and completely insanely amazing !"}, "21296": {"id": "21295", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I am a huge fan of Archer ! It 's a hilarious , adult ( as in not kid safe ) animated series centering on ISIS which is a US based private spy agency staffed by an exciting group of misfits , screw ups , sex addicts , and alcoholics to name just a few . If you have n't gotten into this yet , you are really missing out . This is a series that has yet to disappoint overall . Yes , a few episodes may not be as good as others , but overall I 've loved every season so far.This season premier , the only episode out so far as of this writing , was a little flat in my opinion . The reason being it seemed to spend almost a third of the episode running through snippets of past seasons and another third setting up the rest of the season as ISIS shifts from spy agency to what we can only assume will be some sort of drug cartel . Do n't get me wrong , I think there are great possibilities for story arcs in this new vein , I just wish the episode had been longer so that something would have actually happened . Now that the catch up and set up are behind us , hopefully we will get back to the hilarity of Archer and Lana along with the rest of the misfits raising hell and blowing # % * up like they always do.Regarding the FX ads at the beginning ( and end ) of the episodes ... Is it a little annoying , yes . Would it keep me from enjoying the show ... Not at all . We are usually streaming Amazon through our bluray after the kids are in bed . Ignoring an Always Sunny in Philidelphia or Sons of Anarchy clip is easy enough as I am pouring a drink ( I find scotch or whiskey & coke go well with Archer ) . If I already have a drink when I launch the show commercials still are n't really that big a deal , that is why Steve Jobs gave us iPads and smart phones . Check your email , rant on Facebook , or tweet your displeasure to the masses to get you through and then enjoy the show . Rather than getting worked up about it , I liken it to previews , which I also hate , on DVD/BluRay that I buy . I always skip through when possible , but I do n't let it ruin my enjoyment of the content I purchased.Here is hoping episode 2 and beyond dive straight into the mischief and misdeeds that we have come to expect from our favorite characters ! ***UPDATE 1/29/14***So , episode 3 is behind us and the season is still off its game . There are some chuckles to be had , but none of the laugh till you 're almost crying that we enjoyed in each of the previous seasons . Of course , not every episode of the earlier shows was 22 minutes of constant hilarity , but this season ( after 3 episodes ) is still struggling to get off the ground from where I sit .

As if violating and torturing the girls before killing them was n't enough , this twisted individual likes to decapitate his victims ; sometimes while they 're still awake and conscious and prefers to use a rusty saw . Israeli police officer Mickey ( Lior Ashkenazi ) is put on the case , but likes to do whatever it takes to get what he 's looking for even if that means doing something that 's frowned upon by the commissioner Tsvika ( Dvir Benedek ) . After questioning a teacher named Dror ( Rotem Keinan ) and beating him senseless , a Youtube video of the incident goes viral and Mickey is stripped of his duties . But Mickey is convinced Dror is still the prime suspect and pursues his one lead as a civilian with nothing to lose . Meanwhile , Gidi ( Tzahi Grad ) is the man whose daughter was the most recent victim in this heinous string of murders and is making his own preparations for how he 'll cope with the loss of his daughter.This Israeli thriller begins with a game of hide and seek portrayed in slow-motion and played by what looks like three teenagers ( two girls and one boy ) in a broken down and abandoned house . One of the girls goes missing and only a red shoe is found in her hiding place as the title of the film is seen on the roof as the camera pans out . You 're introduced to the incredible score of the film early on and it seems to be boasting in a way in how triumphant it sounds . After the first five minutes of the film , the music backs off yet is always lurking in the background and tapping at the window . It 's as if the music of & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; is always huffing and puffing and pounding to be let in.While the film is extremely dark , as you can probably imagine , there 's also a lot of black comedy thrown in to lighten things up a little . When Tsvika first calls Mickey into his office , it 's bring your kid to work day and Tsvika 's son is sitting there while Tsvika scolds Mickey parroting everything he says . Doval'e Glickman portrays Yoram , Gidi 's father , and the back and forth conversations Glickman and Grad have between each other at the most inopportune moments are fairly amusing . There 's a scene where Yoram and Gidi are upstairs in the kitchen eating soup . The scene is very calm and serene . The two of them are talking about how wonderful Gidi 's mother 's cooking is . But what 's taking place below them is much more hectic and grim . Then there 's the scene where a man is interested in buying a house and has the real estate agent scream at the top of her lungs while he 's walking around upstairs . There 's this very lighthearted twist at times that makes something very dark extremely easy to digest and enjoy. & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; is a thriller that keeps you guessing . The viewer is left contemplating whether Dror is guilty of these crimes or an innocent man and when you think your mind is made up the film makes your brain shift in the opposite direction . The cinematography is very simple and yet beautiful . Something straightforward like an actor sitting on a bench is shown completely blurry at first , but slowly comes into focus as the camera crawls up on the actor . The inside of the house where nearly half of the film takes place has these glorious mahogany walls and floors that seem to shine whenever they 're showcased and the long , narrow corridor that leads to the room where a man is looking for retribution makes you tense and gives you the shivers.There are very light shades of Thomas Vinterberg 's & # 34 ; The Hunt & # 34 ; in & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; and while the content is incredibly horrific and gruesome not much of it is shown on screen . The film knows when to pull back and seems to know that less is more in that sense . It 's very similar to the original & # 34 ; The Human Centipede & # 34 ; film in the sense that while disgusting situations are discussed quite thoroughly , you typically do n't see most of it . You 're shown enough to get the point across.While & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; will likely be slandered by some for its grotesque nature , there 's much more to the thriller than that since you feel like you 're right along with these police officers trying to unravel the mystery and enjoying the carefree demeanor of most of these characters even when their career is on the line or when possibly facing unbearable torture . & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; may not be & # 34 ; the best film of the year & # 34 ; like certain directors are claiming , but it is a well-executed thriller that leads its audience down unsuspected winding dirt roads filled with painful uncertainty and a foreseeable yet inevitable amount of suffering ."}, "21347": {"id": "21346", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I do n't think lots of viewers got it . This is brilliiant ! Its not a straight up horror film and that 's what makes it great . That might sound strange coming from me , but if you read my review of `` Captifs '' then it should make sense . Any horror film where the protagonist is subdued and captured by an antagonist , who painstakingly planned it and has the resources and skills to execute it , often substitutes graphic violence and gore , ( what people refer to as `` torture porn '' ) for suspense and tension ( the conflict unfolding on screen with suspense and tension is what makes a horror movie ) . There 's no tension or suspense when someone is shackled up and completely in someone else 's power . The conflict is resolved at the moment , in the favor of the antagonist . Saw is an exception in how they cleverly inserted the tension and suspense by having the captive play a game where he/she has to make choices . Hardly anyone has been able to repeat that formula successfully . What these guys do instead is to inject some black comedy during the suspense/tensionless period , until the actual climax arrives ( and usually in these types of films , the ones that do n't work very well , the ending is predictable . Not in this one. ) . There 's a 'whodunnit ' playing out that keeps you mentally engaged . The dialogue is very funny . One of my favorites was the `` Just take some pain . '' exchange between the suspect and the cop . The end is a surprise and not sentimental , which I love . The acting was tops . All the characters were believable and had consistency and integrity ( not in the moral sense ) . They cohered . They also played very well off each other . The subject matter is dark ( child rape and murder ) and the scenes in the basement were somewhat violent ( but not over the top ) but the main body of the film was hilarious !

There are some attempts at humor in this torture drama , but the delivery and timing seemed off . I felt like I was being told a funny story by someone who messes it up.The film was a big hit at the 2013 Israeli Film Academy winning many awards ( not best picture ) . It is highly rated by critics and fans . The film lacked the big twist and gave us a small , almost obligatory one instead . While it copies some aspect of Tarantino , you can detect it is a knock-off like a fuzzy print DVD.I think a better twist would have been if the dad was the killer and he got the innocent Dror to confess , the cop then kills Dror , the audience sees that the dad was the killer ... then you go to the second twist ending as the cop is arrested for murder.3 1/2 starsParental Guide : No f-bomb , sex , or nudity .

The torture scenes were either from a distant or showed you the after effects ... except for maybe that one thing ."}, "21350": {"id": "21349", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is about a serial paedophile and murderer who preys on young girls whom he drugs and abuses . The police know who he is but can not prove it . So after a botched frame up one officer gets told his services are no longer required . He decides to take his revenge out on the prime suspect . Meanwhile the father of his last victim has also decided to take the law into his own hands . What happens next is dark , very dark indeed.Now this is billed as a comedy/thriller , I will agree that it is a thriller but as far as humour goes I was far from smiling throughout . There are graphic descriptions of torture and abuse and scenes of torture that are borderline gratuitous . The music is excellent and really helps with the tension , but the subject matter is very dark and even twisted in places . The humour is subtle but some of the ` gags ' - forgive the pun - are well signposted.As a psychological thriller this works really well and that is where I think it should be placed . The performance by Rotem Keinan , as Dror the schoolteacher who is the suspect , is truly excellent and everyone is convincing . So this is far from being a bad film it is just a bit shocking , and will not be to everyone 's taste . In Hebrew and Arabic with good sub titles this is a good chiller of a film ."}, "21351": {"id": "21350", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "update : i have seen more episodes since I wrote the below review , I must say that James prufroy , who plays villain Joe Carroll is doing the acting job of a lifetime . He is rather tongue in cheek with the audience , just about giving us a sly wink with one audacious act after another . he now has religious followers and he takes it right to the edge of total camp with his posing as their guru . He is simply sensational . Without him , I would have stopped watching.original review : I ca n't say that I am 100 % totally sold on this show as I am on others I 've reviewed here . Certain aspects of it I like really well and others really sag predictably . First off , what works : James Pruefroy as Joe Carroll is the best thing about the show . He is a wonderful villain and even has a sort of evil impishness about him at times . Kill him off and there is absolutely no show . His long time follower Emma is also quite good and is one of the few women on the show who comes off well . The two male heroes , Kevin Bacon and the other FBI guy are also good but they square fully into the usual hero mode of series tv . I do not think there is a problem with the plot either as it is very simple : stop Joe Carroll and his murderous cult of followers . This is so simplistic that great characters and style are necessary for it to work at all.Now as to what does not work : the women on the show are about as disposable as kleenex . I think they keep killing them off with the hopes that they might just luck into one good woman character other than Emma . The ones replacing the women killed off last season are no better . If they get killed off too , no problem . Another problem , this is the most incompetent FBI imaginable . If it were not for our two heroes , we would be made to believe that every other agent on the force can barely put one foot in front of another much less catch groupie cult killers . If they are really this bad , we are in serious trouble.I will probably watch this season play out but I am unsure if I will pick up a third season . If Joe Carroll is killed off , I absolutely will not be watching next season . Frankly if one got rid of the FBI in this and just played it as a cult drama with James Pruefroy starring as the cult leader , I think it would be a much better show . Maybe you could put an agent undercover in his cult . But I sure would love to jettison all these lame duck agents ."}, "21352": {"id": "21351", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "If you enjoy this new show staring Kevin Bacon , go for it and buy ! !

Plus , there 's a beautiful Secret Service Agent ( Meghan Orry , who guest-starred/was a season regular on ONCE UPON A TIME ) assigned to protect him . Their superior ? A tough , but very understanding woman ( Marg Helgenberger , who cracked cold cases alongside Gil Grissom , Raymond Langston and D.B . Russell on CSI : Crime Scene Investigation ) .

He had apparently attempted to play `` The Impossible Piece '' during his last live performance and hit the wrong notes causing him a breakdown and a newly acquired bout of stage fright . His wife , Emma ( Kerry Bish & eacute ; ) , is a world famous actress that has set her sights on fixing his problem .

After he begins reading , he is instructed to rush to his dressing room during a `` down moment '' in the piece , where he finds an ear piece which he then uses to communicate with Clem ( Cusack ) , the man behind the strange writing . Clem informs him that he MUST play `` The Impossible Piece '' at the end of the show to perfection or both he and his wife will die.Sounds interesting , right ? I sort of thought so too . Of course , I also took into consideration the level of acting that was involved in the picture . Unfortunately , they must have seen more than I did in the final product .

If this were the case , Clem ( as an apparent MASTER locksmith ( ? ) ) could either break into the late Godureaux 's estate and dismantle the piano for the key hidden within , or simple pick the lock that the key opens ?

Unfortunately , it 's never set up that texting the brother-in-law might be helpful -- it would have been nice if he were an off duty cop or something like that -- and 5 minutes later the movie is back in exactly the same place it was before Wood sent the text.In fact that 's pretty much where the movie stays until late in the film when the only other twist comes and you find out what exactly is going on .

It 's through Alex and Adult World that Amy meets a drag queen named Rubia ( Armando Riesco ) and even though they get off on the wrong foot they eventually become really good friends.Unfortunately Amy is blinded by selfishness and obsessed with a pessimistic hack . Amy makes a series of poor decisions to try and follow her dream of becoming a poet . She makes childish mistakes , but then becomes upset when someone calls her a child . She 's irritating , has a nerve-grating voice , is naive , and extremely pompous as she seems to look down on everyone around her . Alex at least seems normal even though he works in what some would consider an uncomfortable environment , but the most interesting character is Rubia .

Although historians are aware of the time frame in which the volcano , Mount Vesuvius , erupted & # 8211 ; along with having some names of people that died in the catastrophe & # 8211 ; that & # 8217 ; s really all they know . With that in mind , the imagination and fictitious accounts make up the storyline for the period adventure flick , Pompeii.Paul W. S. Anderson ( Resident Evil , Mortal Kombat ) directs the epic , Pompeii & # 8211 ; starring Kit Harington as Milo . As a young boy , Milo watched as the Romans slaughtered his people ( and parents ) , led by a dastardly soldier , Corvus ( Kiefter Sutherland ) . Although Milo survived the attack , he was captured and thrown into slavery , eventually becoming a lethal gladiator . In fact , he & # 8217 ; s so lethal that his master , Graecus ( Joe Pingue ) , decides to move him to a grander stage in the city of Pompeii.On the way to Pompeii , the lives of Milo and a wealthy merchant & # 8217 ; s daughter , Cassia ( Emily Browning ) , become intertwined . Shortly thereafter , Milo learns he must fight Pompeii & # 8217 ; s gladiator champion , Atticus ( Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ) & # 8211 ; but prior to their showdown , the two men form a surprising and unsuspecting friendship . At the same time , the man that killed Milo & # 8217 ; s family , Corvus , comes to town and is now a well-respected ( and feared ) Roman senator.Corvus has been looking for Cassia ( whom he desperately wants to marry ) and quickly notices the growing bond that has formed between Cassia and Milo . In an effort to dispose of Milo , Corvus puts both Atticus and Milo in the Pompeii coliseum for the fight of their lives & # 8211 ; a fight in which they are sure to lose their lives . However , without any warning , a volcano outside the city erupts thrusting everyone into a panic as the sky rains with fire and ash.For the fans of the popular film , Gladiator , the plot of Pompeii will appear to be extremely familiar . Both feature a storyline that is driven by revenge after the death of the main character & # 8217 ; s family . But , Pompeii is certainly no Gladiator and the fact that both films are being used in the same sentence is borderline outrageous . Still , it & # 8217 ; s hard to ignore the similarities between the two movies & # 8211 ; prompting Pompeii to easily be labeled as a dreaded Gladiator & # 8220 ; knockoff. & # 8221 ; Kit Harington , who is most recognizable from his starring role in the popular HBO drama , Game of Thrones , plays a character that we & # 8217 ; ve seen countless times in the past & # 8211 ; and again is much like the lead character in Gladiator ( although Harington is a far cry from the masterful Russell Crowe ) . Milo is cold as ice on the outside , but clearly filled with righteous emotions on the inside . He & # 8217 ; s been driven by revenge his whole life , but once he lays his eyes on the beautiful & # 8220 ; princess , & # 8221 ; suddenly his heart melts and he has new meaning to live.If you happen to be a fan of Jon Snow ( Harington & # 8217 ; s Game of Thrones character ) , then you should find just as much enjoyment in the Milo character . Harington literally looks like he walked of the set of Game of Thrones and jumped right into Pompeii . In fact , the two characters are so similar that it will be almost impossible to tell them apart . Unfortunately , it & # 8217 ; s difficult to determine whether or not that & # 8217 ; s a good thing or a bad thing . Really , the only bothersome part of Harington & # 8217 ; s character in Pompeii is that it & # 8217 ; s filled with far too many holes since viewers will have no idea what happened to the character from childhood to adulthood & # 8211 ; although one could assume he was constantly in chains.The main character depth issue , which plagues many films that have previously attempted to do too much in too little time & # 8211 ; evident in films like John Carter and Prince of Persia , also hampers Pompeii . Several lead characters , like Emily Browning & # 8217 ; s Cassia or Kiefer Sutherland & # 8217 ; s Corvus , are nothing more than randomly in the wrong place at the wrong time & # 8211 ; sort of like anyone that was aboard the Titanic . Sadly , the ambitions of these two vague , aloof characters are never fully realized , and are poorly reduced to taking part in an under whelming love triangle.Storyline aside , the CGI is also an issue that takes away from the film .

Gladiator slave falls in love with rich beautiful young lady who is pursued by an evil politician . There is so much to tell about POMPEII and the lives of ordinary citizens and the frantic desperate moments when they realized they were doomed.Buffed and chisled Kit Harrington loses his family in Britain and ends up in Pompeii as a slave who is fighting gladiators in the arena .

Maybe more of their love story in a different setting would have been more exciting.Kiefer Sutherland is the evil Roman Senator and Sutherland plays his character with some sort of stilted Briish accent . Why do characters set in ancient Roman times always speak with British accents ? It seems like POMPEII has a sprinkling of the STARZ series SPARTACUS with its gladiator theme . The main action begins in the last part of the film as Mount Vesuvius finally errupts . Here is where the real story should be given more attention as terrified and desperate people are trying to escape while others are resigned to their fates.I watched the bonus feature about the volcano and the filmmakers say they followed the writings of Pliny the Younger who was a witness to the disaster . They said they followed Pliny 's description of the erruption and the effects on the Bay of Naples . Imagine people trying to flee by ship on the unforgiving waters . Here would be a fascinating story and it is addressed to some degree . Some of the visual effects are great .

By the way , the plaster casts we associate with Pompeii were created when archaeologists injected a substance into the hollows in the solidified ash which were left after corpses decomposed.Expect lots of swordplay , spear thrusts , fist fights , earthquakes , a volcanic eruption , and a tsunami .

There were some great films made too , in particular GLADIATOR and TROY . Then the genre died out again or found itself taken over by ridiculously low budgeted reproductions of those popular films . It went back to the shelf . Now director Paul W.S . Anderson tries to bring it to life again with POMPEII . Unfortunately the film falls somewhere between those two types of films , the good and the bad.The story revolves around Milo who as a child watches as his parents and entire tribe of Celt horsemen are slaughtered by the Romans led by General Corvus ( Keifer Sutherland ) and his right hand man Proculus . Pretending to be dead , young Milo climbs from under the bodies of those who were slaughtered only to later be captured and placed into slavery.Years go by and Milo ( Kit Harington ) grows to be a fighter in ancient Britannia . When he catches the eye of one of the promoters for gladiatorial fights in Pompeii , he is taken back to that ancient city . Along the way he encounters Cassia ( Emily Browning ) when one of the horses pulling her carriage falls . He catches her eye not just because of his looks but because he puts down the horse in the most humane way possible.Cassia gets to Pompeii before the slaves on their way . It turns out that her father Severus ( Jared Harris ) is the ruler of the city . Severus is trying to promote the city into a minor version of Rome and is aided in doing so by his wife Aurelia ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) . While pleased to see their daughter home once more they have yet to find out why she came back from Rome . That is explained later when now Senator Corvus arrives to negotiate with Servus for assistance to rebuild the city . Of course , he uses his desire to marry Cassia to eventually seal the deal.Meanwhile Milo finds himself in the slave quarters of the gladiators and a target of another slave whose brother he killed . While he survives that the odds of his surviving the arena are slim , even more so when the plan is to have him face off against his cell mate Atticus ( Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ) , a slave who is about to win his freedom if he defeats his 19th opponent . The pair square off during practice when an attempt is made once more on Milo only to be stopped by Atticus . While each knows they will one day face off against one another in the arena , a bond develops between the two.In the background of these stories is the mountain that rises above Pompeii that seems to be developing into eruption mode . Since we know the story of Pompeii there is little suspense formed by this except wondering just when it will finally blow.A change in plans in the arena has Milo and Atticus united to face off against the Romans . It 's at this time that Corvus makes known his intentions for Cassia to her parents . It also happens to be when things begin to happen with the mountain filling the next 30-40 minutes with tons of special effects and carnage . Even with all of that happening a final face off between good guys and bad must take place.Shot using tons of green screen the movie does a good job of making you believe you 're looking at an ancient city , but then again used as much as it is your belief starts to dwindle after a while . The explosive effects of the last portion of the movie are well made but at the same time stretch your ability to suspend belief as the main characters all just fall short of being engulfed in flames , fireballs , earthquakes or floods.The acting has no standouts here and is fair for the most part . Surprisingly the one performance that disappointed me the most was from Sutherland whose English accent in a movie set in ancient Rome falls flat . Browning 's performance as Cassia lacks the depth and believability to carry off the story . Part of that is due to the love at first sight story telling that has her fall for Milo without any hesitation whatsoever.On the whole POMPEII is n't a terrible movie but it is n't a really good one either . It 's one of those movies you probably wo n't be too disappointed in seeing if you like the genre , but not one that you 'll want to revisit again after watching .

I can understand people practicing polygamy because it 's their religious conviction to do so , as the Browns from Sister Wives claim , but the Williamses say they no longer hold true to the doctrines of Fundamental Mormonism , or the FLDS church .

Rhonda and Robyn are kind and sweet but they too have that same glazed expression as the others.Several episodes into the season , we have n't learned much about the children , though . They 're not really featured in the story lines and no one child stands out above the others . The boys tend to be unruly and it 's understandable , as the family has no table around which to eat and mealtimes often become chaotic . Manners fall by the wayside . ( You 'd think contractor Brady could build one dining hall for the entire family to eat in instead of having to hold plates on laps . ) Brady , who does not seem to be all that charismatic or appealing , tries to appease all the women . Of course that is impossible , we all know that . And every conversation when there 's a problem or disagreement among the women or they with Brady seems staged . He seems to be reading from some conflict resolution handbook every time he answers them . He always says , `` I hear what you 're saying , '' and then he repeats their grievance and gives some kind of wishy-washy answer but that is often just what the woman wants to hear . His responses , frankly , do n't seem natural and I wonder if he would be so kind and understanding if the cameras were n't filming.Despite what appears to be playing to the cameras , some of the women claim that he is not always very fair -- and it does appear that he has favorites -- but how is it possible to love five women at once and be fair to everyone ? It 's the lifestyle in and of itself that does n't promote fairness ."}, "21691": {"id": "21690", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "What a fake boring waste of time .

Dermot Mulroney , who plays the bad guy , looks terrible ... dirty and dingy and not-watchable.The premise is stupid . I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country ( including the president 's son ) , ALL are on a bus ... a & # 34 ; normal & # 34 ; field trip ... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found ... AND no security ON the bus ... AND a crazy ex-FBI ( or other 3-letter word agent ) is on the bus with them . Seriously ! First , is n't a secret service agent to be WITH the president 's kid at ALL times , WITH him , by his side , ON the bus ? Second , none of these other high-powered people have security around their kids at all ... and third , a field trip , a freaking field trip . Where the hell where they going ? What field trip with 16-17 year olds ? WHERE ARE THEY GOING ? And ... a secret service agent is suppose to lay down his life for the president and his family . They are NOT to be compromised . But oh ... wait ... if I buy into this premise , of course they are easily compromised.That premise within itself made me roll my eyes . Then it gets better ... & # 34 ; send the other vehicle ahead to secure the restaurant for lunch & # 34 ; yeah , the one other secret service vehicle ... WHAT ? ... oh , but wait.. it gets better ... the other vehicle disappears then there is a road block ... AND ... let 's get out of our vehicles and NOT secure the president 's son and just see what 's going on ... WHAT ? All of that in the first 15 minutes ... I 'm suppose to buy that ... but oh ... I find out that the show is going to be centered around a bunch of teenagers ... ummm ... no.Gillian Anderson , bless her heart ... she looks good but that 's about it . No emotion ... none ! And she did have a line for that something about ... & # 34 ; I 'm not going to be this way for long & # 34 ; ... WHAT ? oh ... but wait ... the bad guy , is of course , the BEST at what he does ... which I guess is controlling everything thru his computer setup ... and the FBI ( or some other 3-letter agency ) just fired him for something that he , of course , did not do , and let him go on his merry way.One positive note : The storyline with the new-to-the-job secret service agent was pretty good . IF I watched the show again it would be to see how he saves the day , which is where it is seemingly headed . I was engaged with this part . I wanted to see what he would do to save the boy and himself.I did n't care about the rest of the story . I just wanted it to be over . However , the series could be saved . If I was writing it , I would get the teenagers rescued in the second episode so that little teen drama is over . Kill the supposed bad guy and find that he was actually working for someone else so there are is a & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; bad guy . And have a storyline in there of how the secret service and the FBI screwed up . But the remainder of the show would be the FBI against this new bad guy and of course , saving the day.Anyway , this is bad . I could probably pick apart every scene . The suspense is forced . The story itself should produce the suspense . Suspense is not just drawing out a situation , making us wait wait wait for an outcome that we know is coming.At the end of the episode the bottom line seemed to be ... what would you do to protect your child ? ... Well , it did n't seem that any of those high-powered parents did very much to protect their child by putting them on a bus for a field trip with no protection .

Plus , being an X-Files junkie , I was curious about Gillian Anderson 's return to network TV . Those assumptions did hold ... for about two episodes . After that , unfortunately , the show turns into a standard crime procedural lacking any sort of & # 34 ; new ground & # 34 ; .After the first two episodes of & # 34 ; Crisis & # 34 ; , I thought that I had found the next great political drama . A group of high-society prep students on a school field trip ( one being the son of the President of the United States ) are kidnapped and held hostage . It is very interesting to see the different dynamics between the students and how they all react a little bit differently to the situation . Even the heavily-advertised Gillian Anderson return is a hit , as her character adds a toughness angle to the show that seems intriguing.Sadly , that is where the innovation of this show ends . For the next 3/4 episodes , it turns into a complete procedural . It has the stereotypical & # 34 ; one male , one female F.B.I . agent & # 34 ; ( played by Lance Gross & Rachael Taylor ) premise , and follows a & # 34 ; one parent of a hostage each week & # 34 ; approach to storytelling . It is sad , because had the show-runners been able to focus on the relationships between the teen hostages themselves , THAT is where the interesting material was . As soon as the focus shifted to the parents , it became tedious and un-inspiring . Even Anderson 's character has been pretty much in invisible since those first couple episodes.I compare & # 34 ; Crisis & # 34 ; to a show like & # 34 ; Intelligence & # 34 ; on CBS . Both shows had great kernels of concepts/ideas , but instead of truly breaking ground with original storytelling , the networks instead shoe-horn those interesting plots into tired TV storytelling conventions . Both shows were also advertised as something almost completely different from what they turned out to be .

Bo 's `` rescuers '' reunite her with her dad , who was on death row . The reason he was on death row was completely resolved half a dozen episodes later . The evil director of the facility that was studying Bo wants her back and they enlist the FBI -- the sole presence of which is a youngish brunette in a pony tail . That 's the back story.In nearly every episode:1 . Their safe house gets compromised and they have to flee2 . Bo gets a vision about a normal person who needs help . She tugs and tugs on her father 's arm until he gives in.. reluctantly.3 . The 'bad guys ' enlist a psychic to find her or turn on a psychic machine that reads psychic emissions ( wtf ? ) 4 . Bo and her dad hug the people they save5 . The bad guys are shown to have another ace up their sleeveThey state at the onset that Bo needs a normal childhood because she is so powerful she could bring peace to the world . However , nobody shows a trace of growth . Every person 's personality is completely fixed and no experience changes anyone , even slightly.JJ Abrams is n't even trying anymore . He comes up with a plot ( this time shamelessly ripped off from Touch ) , and cranks out a dozen poorly thought out episodes before being handed another series ( and the reins to both Star Trek and Star Wars ) . When I see JJ Abrams name on a series , I know I 'm getting a polished turd .

However , the characters are so unlikable it 's daunting and the plot is n't all that solid to compensate for that fact . Bo especially is the worse , she 's very annoying and I have no idea why she even needs to be protected by anyone .

She also is extremely obnoxious and a know it all.Tate on the other hand is your typical bad boy image who is everything but ... I think the producers failed on creating that one .

The show opens with Cuaron 's directorial trademark of a technically clever tracking shot and after that it devolves into an incredibly dull series of totally unbelievable chases with absolutely zero character growth or plot development.The girl is blessed with some sort of telekinetic capability that she uses whenever the plot needs an escape catch . With this superpower , she should be the least vulnerable human on the planet but instead succumbs to an inept series of bad guys who ca n't decide whether to capture or kill her . She also seems to & # 34 ; sense & # 34 ; people 's problems to get the B plot of the week going so she can run around helping people in between the good guys messing things up.The writing is on par with a first draft from a mediocre screenwriting student at a bad film school and it 's almost inconceivable it was used for production . Every scene is littered with exposition throughout the script ( & # 34 ; You 're a prisoner on deathrow and face execution. & # 34 ; / & # 34 ; You were trained at Quantico and now you 're working on the Tate case & # 34 ; ) . Hardly anything is said that is n't trying to explain the derivative back stories to the audience to the point where I 'm screaming at the TV every time somebody utters one of these inane lines.The bad guys have a near-telepathic capability of knowing where she is at all times and the good guys do the worst job possible in keeping her out of harm 's way , except when they use their own near-telepathic knowledge to protect her . The script conveniently forgets everything that goes before it ( hey , there 's a bag of money on a fire escape in New York that 's still there ) and gives the audience no idea of where it 's going beyond & # 34 ; we 're going to the safe house & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; we 're going to Philadelphia & # 34 ; - why not let 's go to Disneyland and at least have some fun ? Oh , and then major characters disappear - the laughably bad assassin from the pilot presumably did n't test well with the audience , even though they were the least demanding audience in history for liking the rest of the show.All the drama is developed from a simplistic triangle of good guys , bad guys ( Kyle MacLachlan phones it in ) and law enforcement all acting like IQs are dropping everywhere . They operate in a complete vacuum of reality so one moves and the others react and three chase sequences later we 're at the end of the episode . And there 's zero realism to any of the decisions made by the three groups pushing the wafer-thin plot forward so very , very slowly . There has n't been this much stupidity in a TV show since The Following got renewed but admittedly even that managed to attempt to engage the audience.The acting is wooden , the dialog is stilted , the fight scenes are horribly shot , there no tension , there 's no suspension of disbelief and there 's no plot .

Ok , so it is a very confusing tale ( so far at least ) but none of that is helped by the twists and turns that simply go unanswered and are all left to our imagination . Take the female assassin . Not a very good one as she fails in every attempt . So she just up and disappears from the scene to be replaced by a male assassin who obviously is n't any better . Take the scenario at the casino . The & # 34 ; protector & # 34 ; convinces the girl to use her capabilities to help him win some money ( to replace the bag full he left on a fire escape ) . So rightly or wrongly , she helps him rip off a craps table to the tune of 30K . When he notices that the girl is no longer sitting in the eatery , he panics , cashes in his chips and leaves to find the kid . Now during his sojourn at the craps table , there was a craps table boss . He had never seen this guy before and so when he ups and leaves , this & # 34 ; table boss & # 34 ; knows nothing about him other than he was a big winner who suddenly cashed in his chips and left.So we break to the & # 34 ; table boss & # 34 ; who sneaks out into the stair well for a quick smoke . The male assassin follows him out and starts to beat the crap ( no pun intended ) out of the craps table boss , expecting him to know everything about the big winner , like who he is , where he went and on and on the saga goes , becoming more unbelievable with every word that is spoken and every disjointed scene that is played out.There is one theme in the show ( I suspect a story line stolen from another show ) where the little girl does something & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; for someone .

Lars von Trier is probably the king of this . Since his start in the early 90 & # 8217 ; s , von Trier has graced audiences ( small audiences , but audiences ) with his perverse and often shocking depictions of sexuality , sexism and masochism . Sometimes , he finds ways to shade his own ideas , philosophies , theories and musings with enough style and depth to make them feel warranted , making the shock of it all carry the weight it needs to sit on our palate.And then other times he just shows us a lot of pictures of genitals and expects us to feel something other than repulsion.Now , I & # 8217 ; ve been a longstanding champion of von Trier and his vision . While others have tossed many disparaging remarks his way and have taken arms against some of his more recent films , I & # 8217 ; ve stood my ground and played devil & # 8217 ; s advocate in his favor . & # 8216 ; Antichrist & # 8217 ; was a pretty disturbing film , but when all was said and done there was an underlying purpose to von Trier & # 8217 ; s madness , and while it didn & # 8217 ; t all translate how he would have liked ( or at least how the audience would have liked ) there is no denying that von Trier had a pretty bold narrative and some pretty confident points to entertain , and the core performance from Charlotte Gainsbourg was astonishingly grounded in the context of the film ( such a fearless performance , through and through ) .I can & # 8217 ; t defend this. & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac : Vol . 1 & 2 & # 8217 ; is basically a four hour film that recounts a young woman & # 8217 ; s many , many , many sexual trysts . Pretending to exploit ( here we go again with exploitation in film ) the double standard that abounds within the treatment of men and women , especially in a sexual context , & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; confuses all of its own ideals in a strange hodgepodge of & # 8216 ; chapters & # 8217 ; that drone on and on and ultimately take us nowhere . Opening with a beaten young woman named Joe being helped off the street by the neighborhood psychiatrist , Seligman , and then delving into the depths of carnal lusting and abuse , & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; is probably one of the most self-absorbed and self-indulgent films I & # 8217 ; ve ever had the displeasure of seeing.I think that Lars von Trier has a deep-seated interest in uncovering the depths of a woman & # 8217 ; s psyche . I don & # 8217 ; t think that he is a misogynist at all . In fact , I tend to side with Uma Thurman on this subject : & # 8220 ; He & # 8217 ; s a very provocative filmmaker , but he writes women with more depth and respect and complexity than most writers . The idea that people debate whether he & # 8217 ; s a misogynist ? People should debate whether people who don & # 8217 ; t even write women are misogynist . The fact is , he & # 8217 ; s dedicated a large portion of his artistic life to the exploration of the female psyche & # 8212 ; good and bad , light and dark , shadows , textures . The fact that he & # 8217 ; s dedicated a huge part of his talents to that , to me , defies the concept that he doesn & # 8217 ; t have respect , interest , and genuine compassion in women .

They are the misogynists. & # 8221 ; Sadly , this respect and intrigue isn & # 8217 ; t seen very well here at all . Instead , & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; feels about as misogynist as they come , and at the end of the day it & # 8217 ; s even worse than that ; the film feels just plain trashy . Lars von Trier has built a career out of shock value , but his shocking contributions to film have always felt grounded in a linier plot or at least in an idea that has sprouted into madness , but a clear idea at the core . Most of & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; feels nonsensical and devoid of rational narrative , and while he tries to find some footing in the film & # 8217 ; s final throws , he never establishes anything concrete within Joe & # 8217 ; s story to hook us to her , to latch onto us and so it all winds up feeling rather misguided.There is a point here , but von Trier doesn & # 8217 ; t know what it is.Instead , von Trier treats us to a young girl & # 8217 ; s dissention into depravity . She prostitutes herself for sexual pleasure at a very young age , playing games with her best friend and even forming a club that & # 8217 ; s primary focus was to rack up sexual partners , never forming a lasting relationship with anyone ( no one lay to be repeated ) , and Joe recounts her story with absolutely no emotion , as if none of it matters ( because it doesn & # 8217 ; t ) and Seligman tries to liken her whorish behavior to numbers and fish while she relates it all to her dying father and an ash tree ; and while Joe is pretending she & # 8217 ; s falling in love with Shia LaBeouf ( because that could never happen for real ) , volume 1 ends and volume 2 begins and this is where things get dicey . Sexual pleasure is lost , which leads to Joe finding her own personal Fight Club and hiring translators to hook her up with Africans and before we know it , Joe has become a Soprano and is grooming a freaky eared nymph to take her place , and her man.And then Seligman takes off his pants.There is so much going on here and yet none of it ever feels necessary . It is all just there to make your eyes hurt ( they will hurt ) and the film & # 8217 ; s primary point seems to center on how Joe & # 8217 ; s disturbing actions are all validated because men are disgusting pigs and she is living in the repressed guilt of her of desires , but it & # 8217 ; s not that simple and yet von Trier never steps back from his own visual shockfest long enough to try and actually develop these themes . Instead he & # 8217 ; d rather show us a bunch of genitalia and sexual acts and then force feed us a finale that feels appropriate ONLY because the film pretty much sets us up for a cop-out ending.There is such a thing as being bold and fearless , and & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; is both of those things , but it is also soulless and hollow , and when you are both of THOSE things , bold and fearless will only harm you ."}, "21719": {"id": "21718", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Do n't get me wrong - the film did n't offend me .

Set upon the immediately gripping concept of loved ones returning from the dead , the promise of the premise is strong , surely guaranteeing to hit the sweet spot in the Venn diagram of mystery , fantasy and horror . Yet week after week , ABC misses the mark on the show failing to fire on any of the dramatic cylinders that are clearly primed to compete with the ratings juggernaut of the Walking Dead . How could they have messed this up ? As once-dead residents of the IQ-challenged town of Arcadia start to reappear , it 's extraordinary that the least realistic aspect of the show is not the resurrection itself but the staggeringly dumb reaction of any of the characters . Any normal human would ask thousands of questions , wonder if they 're zombies , call the Feds , get extensive medical tests , check the coffins for the bodies , go to pray , start a conspiracy theory website , leave the town - anything , literally anything along these lines that the show refuses to do.Ignoring the vastly obvious pit of story opportunities , the writers are hell-bent on forcing the story logic into a police procedural yet even the cops and thinly-painted medical characters act like they were trained at the same police academy as the FBI from The Following . Instead of taking action on singly the biggest event in recorded history , they do literally nothing and each week the story inches along at glacial speed to the point where I wonder if they remember that these people were dead . It 's almost as if the writers are scared of the plot and have just set up a bunch of generic drama moments hoping for something interesting to happen.In my weekly frustration with this show , I finally decided to check out Les Revenants ( The Returned ) which was a French spin on the idea made a couple of years ago . Cliched as it may sound , this is unfortunately one of those cases where the French original series is so much better that you wonder how the US remake could be so bad . Les Revenants sets up a spooky mystery with a well-selected range of engaging characters , approaching the question of whether the Returned are good or malevolent out to destroy the living without ever becoming ridiculous , giving us some first class acting , dialog and subtle plotting along the way.Resurrection meanwhile is doing none of this and by episode 5 is seriously threatening to jump the shark . Suffering from some of the most unimaginative writing in television today and maybe a network that does n't know which theme and story threads to follow , it 's wasting one of the best story concepts in a long time . Rather than spending countless hours for ABC to find the plot , you can just cue up Netflix and enjoy something vastly superior in The Returned - while you have to wade through English subtitles , it 's better than waiting for anything to happen in this really bland execution of a great concept ."}, "21734": {"id": "21733", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "You know what the bible says , right ?

Unfortunately every ounce of thought that was put into this movie went into the visual design ( Let 's shoot a movie where all the footage is on web cams and computer screens -- cool ! ) and none apparently went into the threadbare and consistently illogical script.The problems start almost immediately when our heroine pitches her project to the university board . Her pitch is basically I 'm going to use a video chat for three months and find out about people and stuff . Despite the lack of any apparent scientific purpose to her project it 's approved -- and then things rapidly get more idiotic.The Den is one of those video chat sites where you can switch from person to person randomly , pressing next if you do n't like what you see . The filmmakers did n't give any thought to what you might actually see on such a chat site -- what they come up with is and old , overweight woman with too much make-up filming herself laughing like she 's a character in a David Lynch movie ; a group of people who prank unwitting viewers by playing a fake game of Russian roulette ; some guy with a cute dancing penis puppet ; etc . While this is all stuff that would not be out of place on You Tube as filmed video if this were being performed live in a rapid screen chat environment then basically you would have people performing the same bit of performance art over and over and over every 30 seconds or so , which is about as believable as anything else in this train-wreck.The heroine is supposedly tech savvy , yet it 's obvious very early in the movie that her laptop has been hacked and she does absolutely nothing about it . It 's not like she has no options -- she could ask her techi pal who set up the video recording software on her computer to take a look or she could just ditch the infected laptop and use some of her grant money for a new computer . Even after she tells her project adviser from the university that her computer has been hacked she still continues to use it and does nothing to protect herself.Later her boyfriend disappears and she 's sure it 's related to whomever is stalking her via the internet . This is such a basic idea that you would think there 's no way the filmmakers could screw it up but they do . You see not only did the boyfriend disappear but every scrap of furniture in his apartment disappeared as well , leaving nothing behind but a laptop which is on the floor transmitting to the villain ( or villains ) . When someone who has a job and a girlfriend disappears for a day or two without warning they do n't take their furniture with them -- it would have been much less suspicious ( not to mention a lot less work ) if the villain ( or villains ) had grabbed the b.f. without also cleaning out his apartment . Luckily for the villain ( but unfortunate for the heroine as well as common sense ) the police do n't find the situation suspicious at all and tell her to stop wasting their time.The Den actually continues to get worse after that until it finally runs out of even bad ideas and pretty much just turns into an amazingly dumb and gore free knock-off of Hostel if it were directed by Uwe Boll in first-person video game mode.Not recommended unless you are determined to see every single horror movie that comes out this year ."}, "21740": {"id": "21739", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "THIS MOVIS IS SO LAME ! ...

You may catch him here and there in various roles , but for the most part , Paul is best known for his outstanding performance in the AMC drug drama , Breaking Bad . For five years , Paul portrayed the quirky Jesse Pinkman , and earned himself several prominent awards , along with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor . However , with Breaking Bad having reached its conclusion , it only seems like a natural decision for Paul to try his luck on the big screen . However , not every successful TV actor translates well to the grander stage of film . And , if Need for Speed is any indication about the direction of Paul & # 8217 ; s future in film & # 8211 ; he might want to start rethinking his character choices & # 8230 ; Directed by Scott Waugh ( Act of Valor ) and based on the popular Electronic Arts video game , Need for Speed stars Aaron Paul as a garage owner and former racecar driver , Tobey Marshall . He , along with a handful of his closest friends , run the garage & # 8211 ; but Tobey has a hard time finding the money to keep it open . He occasionally takes part in street races for side money , yet it & # 8217 ; s never enough to maintain a level of financial comfort.After successfully winning his latest street race , Tobey and his team are approached by Tobey & # 8217 ; s old rival , Dino Brewster ( Dominic Cooper ) & # 8211 ; a famed driver and car tycoon . Prior to his death , car creator Carol Shelby had been working on a special , supped-up version of the Shelby Mustang , however , he wasn & # 8217 ; t able to complete his work . Brewster enlists Tobey to complete the Mustang , at which point he will pay them a quarter of the car & # 8217 ; s worth & # 8211 ; between two and three million dollars . But , egos get in the way and during a street race between Tobey and Dino & # 8211 ; tragedy lands Tobey in jail for a crime he didn & # 8217 ; t commit.After doing time in jail , Tobey openly breaks parole and heads from New York to California & # 8211 ; but not before enlisting the help of high-end car dealer , Julia Maddon ( Imogen Poots ) . She is able to lend him the same Shelby Mustang from his partnership with Dino and he plans to use it to race Dino in a private , invitation only winner-take-all street race & # 8211 ; coordinated by an internet racing guru , Monarch ( Michael Keaton ) . Tobey also has revenge on the mind and plans to prove his innocence while taking Dino down in the process.In the spirit of the Fast and the Furious franchise , Need for Speed attempts to establish characters with a heavy dose of racing in their backdrop . Unfortunately , Need for Speed doesn & # 8217 ; t present a substantial alternative to the Fast franchise , featuring generic individuals that supposedly have credibility , egos , and reputations & # 8211 ; but only because they are force-fed to the audience without substantiated proof . Even the dialogue between the characters is bothersome , as they spend far too much time and effort rattling off bland one-liners and partaking in soap opera-ish melodrama.For someone as talented as Aaron Paul , he is terribly under utilized in the lead role of this lackluster plot . In fact , I dare say Paul is not ready to be a lead actor based on the result of this film . He goes from a supremely popular television drama to a disappointing undertaking & # 8211 ; and it & # 8217 ; s hard to imagine a role of this nature helping him further his career . His character comes off as a bit of fraud & # 8211 ; and at times , his delivery is terribly fake . Even Paul & # 8217 ; s alleged rivalry with the film & # 8217 ; s villain , portrayed by Dominic Cooper , is dependent on false , over-embellished egos and the chemistry is just not there . Obviously , most of us know Paul is a credible actor , meaning the writing is where the fault lies in this presentation.Meaningful character interaction is completely sacrificed for the sake of adding a near endless about of car chases & # 8211 ; inevitably causing more cut scenes of which the eye is able to keep track . There are quite a few outstanding cars worth your admiration in this flick , including the decked-out Shelby Mustang GT500 , plus the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento , and Koenigsegg Agera R. But , it obviously wouldn & # 8217 ; t be a racing movie until they were all prominently wrecked at high speed & # 8211 ; except for the Koenigsegg , which is ridiculously important to the outcome of the far-fetched story.Regardless of how this film plays our , the countless holes in the plot are undeniable . In one particular scene , Tobey & # 8217 ; s team is traveling next to him in a truck in order to refuel his car , so he doesn & # 8217 ; t have to stop and lose any more precious time ( as if it takes more than just a couple of minutes to fill-up ) . In any event , mere moments later Tobey and his passenger , Julia ( who apparently has nothing better to do than to go on joy-rides with convicts ) , randomly stop for gas . Before , time was of the essence , but now it & # 8217 ; s okay to stop ? Come on ? Seriously ? Naturally , there & # 8217 ; s a police office just happens to be in the gas station parking , who predictably chases them around for a few minutes . Go figure.Overall , Need for Speed as downright ridiculous in every possible manner of thinking & # 8211 ; even more so than the Fast franchise . In the real world , Tobey Marshall would have been quickly apprehended in OJ Simpson fashion , but the odds of him going to jail for his alleged & # 8220 ; crime & # 8221 ; in the first place is next to nothing anyway ( since there & # 8217 ; s traffic cameras everywhere these days ) . This terribly scripted film does a marvelous job of making decent actors look like daytime television actors & # 8211 ; not to mention there is absolutely nothing about this film that drastically ties itself to the popular video game franchise ( and video game film adoptions have a history of being terrible to begin with ) . About the only reason you should see this film is if you & # 8217 ; re a diehard fan of Aaron Paul or simply like to see eye-popping , ridiculously fast cars.GRADE : D+FNDNreview.com"}, "21742": {"id": "21741", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "1 . Will there ever be a great video game adaptation ? The other day , I read on a film blog that Splinter Cell finally grabbed a director ( Doug Liman ) and lead ( Tom Hardy ) , which gives me hope ... but it 's really a mind bender that there has n't ever been a great movie based on a video game . I mean , some video games have incredible stories and cinematic element , and somehow they just do n't transfer well on film . Now , just reading months back that there would be a Need for Speed film made me roll my eyes , and I was n't looking at this movie as the 'great hope ' for video game to film greatness , but I was hoping that whoever wrote Need for Speed would n't treat it 's audience like complete morons.2 . Aaron Paul elevates whatever material he 's given.If I 'm being honest ( along with my wife , and probably thousands of others who shelled out their hard earned cash to see Need for Speed ) , the only reason I went to see this was because of Aaron Paul . His turn as Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad was one of the most gut wrenching , heart pulling performances of all time , and any time I have the opportunity to see him do his thing on screen , I 'm going to be there . He was trying so hard with the material here , and despite the utter crap he 's got to say on screen , he still manages to pull it off . I have to tip my cap to Aaron Paul . Such a talented actor.3 . They let you play with iPads in military prison.If there 's one thing I learned from Need for Speed , it 's that they have spare laptops laying around in hospitals and iPads in the brig . At one point , a character is in a MILITARY PRISON , and casually asks a female guard ( who clearly is n't interested ) for an iPad to follow his buddy during an illegal race on what must be a cleverly designed app ( found easily on the App store , I 'm sure ) - either that or it 's just a website that anyone could hop onto and follow the race ( paying attention , cops ? ) . So what does she do ? She grabs an iPad from the ol ' Army surplus of iPads and connects to the Wi-Fi ( again , in military jail ) so that he can fist pump while his friend blows through traffic.4 . The racing scenes were awesome.The plot was so dumb , and makes absolutely no sense . However , if you 're going to see Need for Speed , you 're really going for two reasons - Aaron Paul and the car chases , and let me tell you ... the racing scenes delivered . The roar of the engine , the skidding of tires , the exotic cars , they all looked beautiful . They were shot amazingly and the lack of CGI really showed . There was a great amount of effort into making the car scenes as cool as they were , and it paid off . And that Mustang ... that Mustang ... it really made me miss mine.5 . This plot was so dumb , and makes absolutely no sense.Yeah , this is a car movie , but it 's still a movie , right ? Up until our hero gets out of prison , I was with this plot . Sure , the dialogue was hokey , and everyone on Aaron Paul 's racing team came across as if they wanted to date him , but I was with it . Then , it went completely off the rails . When he gets out of prison , his plan is to enter this super secret race to get revenge against Dominic Cooper 's villain character . Exactly how though ? At this point , he does n't even know if Cooper is in said race ( and actually , he was n't at that point ) . Somewhere in there , the villain also enters the race , because he runs a failing auto dealership and needs a few more cars ? Also , can we address the fact that Kid Cudi plays a pilot who can fly anything ... and does ? He randomly shows up in planes , news helicopters and at one point , an Apache , like he calmly goes to a rent-a-whateveryouneedforthisscene , and there he is , in the sky without difficulty . Or Michael Keaton 's character , who apparently puts this race on every year , who just broadcasts everything from his living room and is never caught ... because ... why ? This script really goes the extra 3,000 miles to insult the audience with stupidity.If you 're looking for a movie where you need to check your brain at the door ... or completely chuck it out of a McLaren going 200mph , this is the movie for you . My suggestion ? Wait until it hits Netflix and fast forward through the garbage that is n't car racing ."}, "21743": {"id": "21742", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Theatrical review . There may be spoilers.Scott Waugh brings the successful video game to the big screen . I expect the film be in the running for worst film of the year . I was lured in to see some cool cars ( especially the Shelby Mustang ) , some cool driving sequences and was n't expecting much else . There was one surprise . A pretty good soundtrack which for me was highlighted by Jamie Common 's version of Dylan 's `` All Along The Watchtower . '' So I was satisfied with my reason for going . But still , I love movies and was expecting something more than this claptrap.The so called plot consists of garage owner , Tobey Marshall ( Aaron Paul ) a wannabe race car driver agreeing to spruce up a Mustang owned by his high school nemesis , Dino Brewster ( Dominic Cooper ) . Dino has gotten hands on the Mustang being developed by Ford and Carroll Shelby that was n't finished after Shelby died . Once Tobey and his misfits of a crew fix up the car , they would get a quarter of the sales price , expected to be in the neighborhood of $ 3 million.In a just-for-fun match race between Tobey , Dino and a close friend ( Harrison Gilbertson ) of Tobey 's who also happens to be Dino 's girlfriend 's younger brother and she happens to be the former girlfriend ( Dakota Johnson ) of Tobey 's . Well , high speeds on city streets can be dangerous and you guessed it , something bad happens . This all leads to an eventual big-balls-takes-all-shootout in northern California and Tobey and his now sold Mustang 's new owner 's associate Julia ( Imogen Poots ) , now must cross country to get to the big 6 car race where the winner gets all the cars.This story is so full of holes it 's just absurd .

After a race-baiting if not racist-in-context threesome , the lovingly rendered scenes of bloody S & M ; , and escalating , I was expecting a beheading by the end of it all . It was worse . The two final confrontations were what led me to believe the film was against all that is good , or maybe just against all that is . The film delighted in erasing any positive sentiment it had accidentally cultivated -- or maybe it cultivated positive sentiments for the sole purpose of annihilating them.So our heroine -- or hero , since she calls her Joe and not Jo -- is against love ( stated in Volume I ) and against the sentimentality of motherhood ( stated in Volume II ) . I champion neither , but if the alternative is this ceaseless funfest , then love and motherhood start to look positively enlightened . I mean , come on , we all had the young adult ` this-can't-be-it ' moment , so when Joe deadpans : `` Perhaps the only difference between me and other people is that I 've always demanded more from the sunset . More spectacular colours when the sun hit the horizon . That 's perhaps my only sin . '' we can indulge her , until we realise she is completely serious , and humourless in general.Volume I gave us the fishing , maths and music analogies . Volume II has nowhere to go but religion , so we have Western ( Roman Catholic ) vs. Eastern ( Orthodox ) Churches and The Transfiguration . By this time , the analogies seem more compulsive and excessive than our nymphomaniac.Then Seligman says something to the effect ` Being anti-Zionist is not the same as being anti-Semitic , ' a completely unnecessary thing to say . And then Joe with her ` negro ' comment . That was part of what made me think the threesome was ... racial . She says all women fancy it , setting up black male sexuality , and then the outcome of the threesome , while not explicitly emasculating , was cutting . The scene itself is somewhat hilarious outside race , but in the context of her comments and the fact that the noted appearance of black people in the film is end-capped with buffoonery and bookmarked with a racial and sexual stereotype is suspect . I 'm not saying you can not have divisive characters in film . But perhaps Seligman and Joe exist to spout the same viewpoint : they simply divided the dialogue . Seligman got the analytical persona and Joe got the compulsive persona , but , in the end , over-analysis and compulsion are both ways to somewhat pompously distance yourself from other people and from life itself ."}, "21747": {"id": "21746", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Nymphomaniac : Volume 2 was not where as good as Volume 1 .

When her bid to anchor a national network is rejected , her friends take her out for a night on the town to get her mind off her problems . Unfortunately , after a very drunken one-night-stand , Meghan is informed that the network is willing to give her one more chance . Stranded by boozy circumstances without her purse , phone , or car , Meghan has eight hours to make her way through L.A. 's grimier districts and back to her place of business . This is less a walk of shame than it is a hasty dash with stolen bicycles and the occasional glimpse of meth.The movie is n't what I would call actively bad , but it is also pretty much a predictable comedic installment running through all of the same tired motions with the same stock characters . And , of course , the movie stretches credulity multiple times . Sometimes it 's a background thing : Meghan 's one night stand is with an impossibly good-looking bartender ( Jason Marsden ) whose open-plan , exposed-brick studio apartment would cost more than twenty L.A. bartenders could afford in a good month . Mostly , though , the incredulity is stretched at the expense of the movie 's main comedic crutch , which is that the mostly demure Meghan has borrowed her slutty friend 's sexy yellow dress and now everyone she encounters immediately assumes she 's a hooker . Cue : shenanigans as no one helps her.While most comedies like this rely a lot on hilarious misunderstandings , it takes some clever writing to make that misunderstanding seem believable , and here it simply does n't work . Or at least not consistently . Audiences are left to wonder why she does n't just speak up for herself while cops and bus drivers are reading her the riot act . You could argue that she 's trying to avoid being noticed as a local news anchor ( the network that 's considering her has made it clear that they want someone with a respectable , family-type image ) , but really , Meghan 's circumstances could be easily explained without salacious details . So , under this overriding conceit , she runs from horny cab drivers , runs through traffic , gets involved in gang shootouts , and becomes something of a news item herself.I considered the film a three-star movie up until the final five or ten minutes , when our conclusion turned into moralizing . I do n't know why comedies feel like they have to have some kind of lesson or message in them . Is n't it enough to make people laugh ? Anyway , while the movie was mildly amusing in a forgettable way , it took a turn for the worse at the end when Meghan decided to turn her walk of shame into one of pride , and the scriptwriter decided to shoehorn a weird , clunky sermon about being yourself and judging others . The moment feels forced and preachy and vaguely off-putting . Much in the same way that the people Meghan encounters are constantly chastising her for looking as skinny and tawdry as a meth-addicted hooker , while that -- I 'm sure -- is what the producers were hoping would be a big drawing point for audiences . With apologies to Elizabeth Banks , who I think is both beautiful and talented and who does a stand-up job here in spite of the material.Mostly forgettable when it is n't annoyingly pounding the pulpit , this is yet another cookie-cutter comedy from the Hollywood treadmill ."}, "21763": {"id": "21762", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "The makers of this should be ashamed .

Having such a thin story acts as a double-edged sword . It means we are n't saddled with a lot of narrative detours , but it also means that there really is n't much time for character development . And once the plot kicks in , it 's just a series of comic set-pieces , a few of which work , but most of which do n't . Oftentimes , the humor they were going for was too awkward and bordered on creepy . They also gave away a lot of the best jokes in the trailer .

The problem I had with the film was the fact that I just did n't find it all that interesting . Honestly , I 'm not 100 % sure what could have been done to remedy this problem ?

While camping one night , Riley is awaken by strange lights . He wakes his brother , Corey ( Corey Eid ) and sister , Jillian ( Jillain Clare ) to inspect what he is looking at . Three lights appear in the sky overhead and quickly shoot out of sight . This is apparently an ongoing phenomenon that occurs in North Carolina and is simply known as the Brown Mountain Lights.Riley continues to film the vacation and eventually the family gets lost in twisty mountain roads . When they come upon a tunnel , they discover numerous cars that have been vacated suddenly and are blocking the road ahead . When their dad , Peter ( Peter Holden ) gets out to inspect , the 3 guys head inside while Jillian and her mom , Katie ( Katherine Sigismund ) go for a bathroom break .

When the father gets them lost and loses his temper his behavior is totally unfounded . When they run out of gas ( which I do n't see happening on a family road trip into the mountains ) the family tension escalates and the father becomes rage-y , again unconvincingly .

They 're tall , lanky , grey-skinned , big-eyed , four-fingered extra terrestrials that sound , at times , like the Predator ( 1987 ) mating with a velociraptor while slitting a pig 's throat .

You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson . In the book , Isserley was not a beautiful woman , having been ( painfully ) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth . That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable . They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone . The objectification of women was a large part of the story . Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment . Her alien insights were intriguing , something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end , what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI .

I know ScarJo relocated to France to be with her new husband , a bonanza for European film makers , but if she keeps making these cheaply produced European films , she wo n't be an A-List actor for much longer.The plot is pretty straightforward and can be reduced to a single sentence : an alien is surgically reconstructed to appear to be an alluring human female who entices men to the aliens ' feeding pens .

Keep in mind that there is only 1 wiper blade in each package , so if your vehicle requires two blades of the same size , you will need to order 2 of these .

Only time will tell if this curvature is maintained or if the `` exoskeleton frame '' on typical wipers is there for a reason and we should n't fix what is broken.Now , one improvement I have noticed that this wiper does NOT have and that 's the inclusion of an aero-foil so that at highway speeds , the wiper actually stays on the windshield glass . I have that on my weekend car and I have noticed a markedly signficiant improvement , the aero-foil really does keep the wiper on the windshield glass.I suppose if Bosch can keep the simple , cleaner-appearing non-wiper body plus adding a sleek aero foil , then at that time , it might be a 5-star wiper .

I listed the differences between the two below : Nissan Matic-J ( semi-synthetic automatic transmission fluid ) this one is being phased out to only Matic-SNissan Matic-S ( fully-synthetic automatic transmission fluid ) From what I was told by my Nissan Tech friend , if your owners manual states that your vehicle requires Matic-J fluid , then you can mix and use both Matic-J and Matic-S fluids in your transmission .

I bought these bulbs to replace the fairly dim bulbs in the dash of my 1996 Ford pickup , which has 194 style bulbs . I had already replaced my dash bulbs with the & # 34 ; high output & # 34 ; filament type 194 bulbs . They still were n't bright enough for me , so I decided on LED 's . These Jtech 5smd bulbs were a VERY slight improvement , but not worth the trouble . The bulbs have some SERIOUS drawbacks : First , these bulbs are POLARIZED ! ! meaning , they only work in one direction in the vehicle . Most dash lights that use 194 bulbs are n't always going to light up all the time- I wanted to replace the very dim warning lights as well-you ca n't just make all the warning lights come on -- there 's no way to tell for sure that you have installed the bulbs correctly . There is no indicator on the bulb to denote which side is to be for positive and which side is to be for negative . I had to remove all but the illumination bulbs , which I was able to check the function of.Second , the bulbs are very flimsy and not well constructed . The led portion is not very securely fastened to the plastic socket assembly . Additionally , the & # 34 ; plug & # 34 ; uses cheap ultra-thin wire as the contact , which is very easily bent out of position . You must ensure that the wire is in exactly the right position , and if you have to bend it very far , it will break . I have very little to believe that these bulbs will last any length of time at all . One of my dash bulbs has failed in less than ONE MONTH ! ! ! Third , and this is my fault for buying the wrong style led , not the manufacturer 's fault ; only the flat & # 34 ; top & # 34 ; portion of the LED actually does anything if you 're trying to use these for a dash illumination application . These might work where there is 360 degree unobstructed area around the bulb , but even when used in a reflector in the map light of my little Toyota , the light output is scarcely more than the 194 filament bulb that it replaced . There are LED 's with 4 or even 8 SMD led 's that are mounted flat on the top of the plastic plug assembly -- this is what you want for directional light output.Bottom line , if you 're looking to purchase the least expensive LED bulb , this is it . If you are looking for a well-constructed , bright bulb to replace your dash lights , this is NOT the bulb you are looking for . To be fair , these bulbs would work fine if you 're not needing a directional output light , and where you can check that the polarity of the bulb is correct before trusting it to work ."}, "22058": {"id": "22057", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I tried this after a friend recommended it to me , saying t lasted a few weeks and had good shine.More so then any other tire shine I have used , you MUST make sure your tires are 100 % clean .

Why ca n't it just tell me how I am driving without requiring me to be registered on their site ? When I first plugged Automatic into my car , I got a nice beep from the device itself to let me know it was plugged in . The Automatic app on my iPhone ( now that I was registered ) failed to find the device . I tried to plug and unplug a few times , but eventually I force-closed the app ( double click the home button on the iPhone and throw away the app ) , and re-launched it . On re-launch , it found my dongle.Once in the app , it is fairly simple . When you drive your car , it will alert you if you do one of three bad things - hit the brakes hard , drive over 70 , or have a hard acceleration . If that happens , a small sound will play and your `` driver score '' will get dinged . When you stop the car , it will record your distance , MPG , and a rough estimate of the cost of that trip based on current gas prices . It also will maintain a cumulative driver score . The nice part about the app is that it essentially provides you a log of your drives while it runs in the background of the iPhone , so you can look back on your driving history.There is also an engine status page where you can see the status of the engine and read any codes that may be thrown . If your car has a check engine light , it can advise you what is wrong . A problem with the vapor recovery system might require tightening the gas cap . Yes , this can save you a trip to the mechanic , but I 'm not sure how many other codes are that simple.So why only 3 stars ? First , I was hoping that the driving statistics would be more meaningful . How about a graph of my acceleration over the trip , car efficiency , oxygen sensors , etc ? In fact , none of the internal sensors are brought out so I can view them , much less logged over time . All of this data is aggregated into my driver score . I can buy a reader for my car that costs less than this and will link with my laptop to provide live car readouts . I get that this is n't their target market , but they are charging a lot more for this than their competition . It 's `` just software '' , so why not provide an `` advanced '' screen with live engine status readouts ? Why not log speed data ? It just does n't do that much.Second , there are plenty of highways where the speed limit is above 70 . Why not let me customize this limit ? This device is not going to be useful in places with higher speed limits.Third , I did n't mention it in my review , but there is a Crash assist feature that I am dubious about . It says it will get me assistance in case of a crash using an accelerometer in the device . Why not use the accelerometer in my car , or use airbag deployment as a proxy ? How do I know if it is tuned right ? Will an accidental kick set it off ? And who monitors the crash system ? My home alarm system is monitored by a UL approved monitoring company . General Motors has OnStar . I have no idea what sort of back-end system Automatic has monitoring crash alerts and what kind of load it can handle . Not to mention - they do n't know my cell phone number . If I am in a crash , how will the police contact me ? How will I let them know it 's a false alarm ? The app and website are really sparse on this data.So conclusion ? In short , it does work . If your check engine light is on , it will tell you the code and let you reset it , but a $ 15 reader will do that . It will alert you if you make 3 driving errors ( accelerate too fast , drive too fast , or brake too suddenly ) , but even then , the `` drive too fast '' wo n't let you customize it for the road.Based on the data they 've given me so far , I have little confidence in Crash Alert ( it even says `` Beta '' ) , and I am sorely disappointed that for $ 100 , I ca n't view engine status , sensors , or anything else in my car . At the very least , allow me to log acceleration data on the drive.3 stars - the hardware seems to work , but the software has a long way to go to justify the price.UPDATE : After using this for 2 weeks , going on a long car trip , and driving through a congested city , I am updating this to 2 stars as I am removing it from my car and putting it away until Automatic releases a serious software update . It is beyond useless . I drove down I-95 to Richmond where the speed limit is 70 . As soon as I hit the speed limit , it started beeping at me - very distracting while driving . As I said before , if you ca n't even drive the speed limit without getting your driver score dinged , what is the point ? I also had a car in front of me stop short . I slammed my brakes and got beeped at again . I do n't know what the folks at Automatic expect me to do when a sudden obstacle is in front of my car , but I fear the beeping alarm could cause me to get startled and have a real accident.My hopes for this device were that it would be like the Prius in terms of driver feedback . I do n't own one , but I 've driven one and noticed the live readout of your MPG . You learn to slowly apply the accelerator and how exactly to drive to maximize fuel economy . It is a live readout of everything . That is what Automatic could have done - live readouts during a drive . Instead , I get a binary decision on 3 factors . Two of those factors can be violated for normal reasons that have nothing to do with bad driving habits , and the distracting alarm could cause a real accident . The only feedback I get during a drive itself is a rotating icon that lets me know a drive is in progress . Seriously ? No other live display ? Meanwhile , by hiding all engine sensor data , there are real things like dirty air filters and low tire pressure that could be reported and could really help fuel economy . But Automatic ignores this data from the car computer.Seriously , I do not recommend this device ."}, "22142": {"id": "22141", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This product does exactly what it says it does . I plugged it into the OBD-II port on my 2004 BMW M3 and it linked up to my iPhone 5 . Took three tries , but it worked.Problem 1 - ( Unavoidable ) - it requires you to leave a doggle plugged into your OBD-II port . My port is just above my clutch pedal and there is a little door that swings down when the doggle is plugged in . This causes my foot to bang into the open OBD-II port door when I use the clutch . This is unacceptable to me . I guess I could rip off the door.Problem 2 - The doggle emits a tone whenever a threshold is reached - either speed , acceleration , or breaking . The tone can not be turned off . It comes from the doggle , not the iphone.Problem 3 - You can not adjust the thresholds . For example , it emits a tone when you exceed 70 mph . This is ridiculous . Everyone drives over 70 mph . Even my 94 year old grandmother . Everyone . The acceleration and breaking tones are similarly set with very low thresholds . The inability to adjust the thresholds ( coupled with the inability to turn off the incessant tones ) will lead me to remove this from my car.Problem 4 - It strives to tell you how much each trip costs you , but does not give you the ability to input the price of gas . This makes the readout completely unreliable.The whole point of this seems to be to prompt your to get better mileage . ( There is also a function to send a text message if you are in a major crash . Presumably that means the airbags deploy . ) It is a giant nag and the inability to customize any of the thresholds makes it pretty useless to me . It was constantly beeping at me . After three days of driving with it , I have learned to simply ignore the tones . That defeats the purpose.UPDATE : After leaving this attached to my car for two days of non-use I have a dead battery . Never had a dead battery before in this car and often leave it for a week or more without use , so I am blaming this device ."}, "22143": {"id": "22142", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I love techno gadgets , but this is a $ 100.00 dollar toy , and nothing more .

I personally think Ben 's lyrics are just as good as Hornby 's , but if there 's anything a guest lyricist 's contribution did , it had Ben approach songwriting from a totally different perspective . I think Ben is a great songwriter in every single way , but he 's been doing it for 16 + years with the same formula . Having to write music around someone else 's words seems to have given Ben a reason to really perfect the music . He said it himself in recent reviews ; he felt like he had to live up to the quality of the lyrics being sent to him .

I have been a huge Accept fan for most of my life , so there 's some sentimentality in there as well.I have wavered back and forth in my opinion so often because much of this album we 've heard before ( and better ) in the 80s . There are so many of the same song structures and suspiciously familiar riffs on this album that my first four listens made me feel anxious for it to end . The situation has n't improved since . So much of this is safe and obvious , to a numbing extent . I mean , I can understand that bands that are staging a comeback tend to want to give their fans what they want , which is inevitably the familiar . Besides the two aforementioned tracks , the songwriting itself on this album is at best just above average ; the overall quality of each track does n't warrant the length of the cd at all.The upside ? Mark Tornillo has legitimately replaced Udo Dirkschneider , as incredible as it seems . He shares some stylistic similarities to Udo while bringing his own personal , fascinating quirks . He 's perfect for this . Wolf Hoffman plays fantastically well , even better than usual considering he 's known as a great guitarist to begin with . The production is pretty typical in that over-digitized way that people other than myself ca n't seem to get enough of , and the drums are right up there with the killer 80s Accept drum soundSo , well worth buying both for the two awesome tracks , and to help fund another ( hopefully more adventurous ) album ."}, "22171": {"id": "22170", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "What do you get when you mix New Wave British Metal with German march choruses , sprinkle in a little Thrash and even a little early 80 's Glam Metal ?

He is the man for the job , without a doubt . One would think Udo is too iconic to replace ... maybe so in 1986 ... but not in 2010 . Mark not only replaces Udo ... but SURPASSES him and compliments the band perfectly here . His voice is gruff enough to handle the traditional Udo songs ... but has a wider range to enhance these new songs . He has a banshee like scream that is a blend between Brian Johnson of AC/DC and Rob Halford of..well ... ROB HALFORD fame.For me , as it has always been , it 's about the maestro WOLF HOFFMANN . He and Peter Baltes have done the impossible . They have taken music that so easily could be considered `` dated '' and have made it so contemporary you would not think that this is a band that has been around over 30 years . Andy Sneap ( producer extraordinaire of bands like Arch Enemy , Nevermore , etc ... ) really brought this classic metal act into the new millenium.I could go on and review track by track ... but that is pointless .

Since last album The End Is Not The End , I 've been convinced that House of Heroes is the top punk band in all of Christian music . With this album , they are now my favorite punk band in all of rock music . I am a long-time fan of Weezer , Jimmy Eat World , Plain White T 's , Death Cab for Cutie and Relient K. If you like those bands , get this album immediately . House of Heroes won me over 2 years ago with `` If , '' `` Lose Control , '' `` In The Valley of the Dying Sun '' and `` Field Of Daggers . '' I have had the privilege to see the band in concert twice and heard them perform a few songs from this new album last month . If you like what you hear on this album , do n't miss out on seeing them perform live . I have n't seen many bands who are even better in concert at performing incredibly tight guitar riffs and singing amazing harmonies than on the studio recording . House of Heroes are the real deal.Suburba is hooky , ambitious , and dripping with honest , candid emotion . This is what a rock record is supposed to sound like . This is what a rock record is supposed to feel like . `` I like this album because we chose to write about things that we knew , '' states frontman Tim Skipper . `` We wanted it to sound very American and full of youthful energy . We kept a lot of what we loved about the last record , but we just applied it differently and I think it came out exactly the way we wanted it to . This record is about growing up in middle class suburbia , '' states Skipper . `` It 's about fighting for your own identity in the face of society 's ideas about love , money , religion and power . It 's about having big dreams and going after them with reckless abandon , yet having to reconcile the fact that things are n't always going to go your way . And it 's about realizing , throughout all of it , that God is real and is the one constant among all the variables of life . `` The opening moments of the first track `` Relentless '' will appeal to any fan of 1980 's electronic rock . The mix of diverse musical styles with Tim Skipper 's amazing vocals are an incredible combination that gets better and better with each album . The standout songs on Suburba include the anthemic album opener , `` Relentless , '' `` Elevator , '' `` So Far Away , '' `` Salt In The Sea '' and the epic `` Independence Day For A Petty Thief . '' House of Heroes went the extra mile this time around to create lyrics that are cool , calculated , and crafty , while remaining vertical all the while . On `` God Save the Foolish Kings '' they comment on the search for significance : `` And we fight ` cause we 'd rather break our bones than brave this loneliness , And we draw blood ` cause we 're just trying to draw out some significance , But I met God on the street tonight , He said , `` Choose your battles wisely or you 'll never find me . '' On `` Love Is For the Middle Class , '' they comment on materialism and unconditional love : `` If all I gave was love , Would you give up on me ? But if you measure love in false securities , I owe you nothin ' at all.. '' Perhaps the most poignant moment of all on the record comes in its most worshipful , on the track `` Constant , '' where House of Heroes simply states the following : `` All thru the night I was fallin ' , Straining to hear your voice callin ' . You never gave out . You never gave in . You never quite gave up on me . You are my constant . `` CLOSING THOUGHTSSuburba is without a doubt the top punk rock album of the year . I ca n't get enough of this album and expect multiple GMA and GRAMMY award nominations for this album . If you have n't jumped on the House of Heroes bandwagon , do n't wait any longer .

On her first two albums ( 2004 's `` Goodies '' and 2006 's `` The Evolution '' ) the strongest moments were without question the singles , as `` My Goodies , '' `` 1 2 Step , '' and `` Like A Boy '' were killer hits and burned up the charts . On her 2009 album `` Fantasy Ride '' she mixed in a few tender ballads , a duet with Justin Timberlake , and a few dancefloor anthems ( `` Work '' is one of her best ever songs ) , but only one single managed the top 10.Just over a year later , `` Basic Instinct '' has appeared , after several delays . The first two singles ( `` Ride '' and `` Gim me Dat '' ) have not been huge chart hits , which is disappointing , because they are quite good ( but not great ) tracks . The best moments come during the middle of the album , when she teams up with Tricky Stewart for a couple of mainstream hip-pop gems ( `` Heavy Rotation '' and `` Yeah I Know ' ) .

Plus all the songs sound consistent as an album ( i.e . if I manually mix a 1998 track with a 2010 track you can tell the difference if recording quality / sound volume ) .And I ca n't believe if you buy the hard copy you get the Skacoustic cd too ( with acoustic versions of most of the songs ) ! That 's insane value ! But note this is only in the NON-MP3 order . I downloaded the MP3 version , which did NOT include Skacoustic ( oops - guess I should read the reviews ! ) You can still download Skacoustic separately though . So keep in mind I 'm only talking `` best of '' in my review here.So will you like the `` new '' best of versions ? First off , they 're all top notch quality . One reviewer implied they were n't trying or something - I do n't get that at all ! Second , they 're pretty similar to the originals . A casual fan would not know the difference . But you get some different voice inflections and things , just like most bands end up doing in concert - you change how you sing a line or two here and there . In fact , its pretty much like getting a high quality live recording on a night where the band played it really close to the album.What if you know all the songs already , should you get this ? That was n't my situation , but I think if you love the way it was originally done , there 's not enough difference to justify a whole purchase of the best of . But if you 're like me and only knew maybe half these songs , I guarantee you 'll love some of the others , great stuff !"}, "22201": {"id": "22200", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 've been a fan of RBF and Ska for years and when I saw this in a store I decided to pick it up and hear how these songs sounded redone .

One things for sure , these cats are becoming really good at producing . The production is wonderful . Plus they still write great catchy songs . But if i had to choose an album of theirs id pick fancy footwork . That album was fun and every song was good .

'' When I saw them perform songs like `` Waiting For You '' I knew these guys were something special . Their music has clearly been influenced by Hall & Oates , among other 80s pop musicians . Their last album - Fancy Footwork - was flat out awesome ! So , I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of `` Business Casual . '' I 've been listening to it all day , and here is what I think of it . `` Business Casual '' is a very solid album . It has many incredibly catchy songs like `` Night By Night '' - the BEST song on the album ! `` I 'm Not Contagious , '' `` When The Night Falls '' and `` Do n't Walk Away '' are all amazing songs as well . Almost every song on here is excellent . I do n't think it topped `` Fancy Footwork , '' but `` Business Casual '' is more of the Chromeo I 've grown to love . It did not disappoint.One thing I really like about Chromeo is that they truly care about the music they create . If you listen to their songs multiple times , you 'll pick up on different instruments you did n't notice before . That 's because they spend a great amount of time adding multiple layers of incredibly effective music . If you your hips or lips do n't start moving by the time this album is over , you might want to check your pulse because you 're probably dead ; )"}, "22209": {"id": "22208", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "If one tries to explain and define Chromeo 's sound in one word that word would be followed by the word retro ( for a better overview of the band I suggest watching their video for `` Do n't Turn The Lights On '' , it will give you a good idea ) . Chromeo is just that , awesomely retro , it may not be the best way of putting it but it certainly gives a good idea of the type of band that Chromeo is , the band has been compared to artists such as Hall & Oates among others . Chromeo is very much a 1980 's fueled electronic band , they have a current electronic sound mixed with 80 's pop and at times the disco of the 70s ' , the result is musical genius ( at least in this reviewer 's opinion and perhaps fans of 80 's music ) . It is genius to use the sound of the 80 's artists that influenced them but at the same time making it sound current , this is why I find the band so interesting . I 'll tell you right away I 'm not a fan of pop or modern mainstream music at all but I do enjoy 80 's music more than some would admit to . Chromeo is one of the modern bands that I really enjoy and hope will continue bringing us their genre of music.This Montreal based French Canadian electro band 's ( I think that French electro is some of the best , for instance I loved some of the stuff that Daft Punk and later Justice put out ) breakthrough came in 2007 with the release of their album Fancy Footworks , before FF they released their debut in 2004 She 's In Control which had the small club hit `` Needy Girl '' . With Fancy Footwork the band went further into the retro element of their style and the band evolved in better direction I feel , the songs on that album are excellent.The band 's new album Business Casual continues in that direction but is a different album altogether . It is filled with delightful retro pop sounds like the catchy and energetic `` Hot Mess '' . The album 's first single `` Do n't Turn The Lights On '' is one of the best songs here and it 's easy to see why it was chosen as the single , excellent song with terrific lyrics . I was surprised that Chromeo included `` Night By Night '' from Facny Footworks , it sounds like a retro 70 's disco sound and is incredibly catchy , this was one of the best songs from FF and it 's also one of the best ones on Business Casual . One could ask : why did they include it again on this album ? For one reason it 's an amazing song and if it did n't get attention the first time around , maybe on this album it will get the recognition it deserves . `` I 'm Not Contagious '' is exactly the opposite of its title , it 's overly contagious with energy and you feel this song is contagious ! `` Do n't Walk Away '' is a slower-paced song with a funky disco vibe to it . There is also a song in French `` J'ai Claqu & eacute ; la Porte '' which is interesting to say the least . And those are just a few of the songs on Business Casual.I do n't think Business Casual is the band 's best album yet , I would say Fancy Footworks remains their best , but Chromeo continues to make superb modern-retro music that I just love . If you 're new to the band I would recommend you start with Business Casual however . BC is a strong album and I hope that Chromeo will get the attention they deserve , they 're getting more exposure ( MTV certainly did since FF ) but for now it 's almost as if the band is a well-kept secret in a way . If you 're a fan of 80 's ( and it would help if you liked some disco ) pop music then I believe you should give Chromeo a try . Not quite a 5 but a close 4 ."}, "22210": {"id": "22209", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I probably should have bought some of Paul 's music years ago , but incredible as it may seem , this is the first collection of his music I 've actually owned . Apart from his big hit Diana ( which is featured here as well as regularly turning up on multi-artist compilations ) , I do n't think I 'd actually heard any of his other music prior to buying this set . I had n't really thought about what to expect the rest of the music here to sound like , but I would have expected to find some rock'n'roll ( he wrote It does n't matter anymore for Buddy Holly ) but there 's none here . Instead , we get treated to a lot of music that really dates from an earlier era - the swing music of the thirties and forties , along with a French-themed album . I love that music too , so I 'm happy with that , albeit a little surprised.Here , you 'll find Paul 's first three albums , plus the singles that were n't also released as album tracks . Thus , all of Paul 's British and American hits from the fifties are here , but the major part of this set is devoted to Paul 's early albums . The first and third albums each occupy the first twelve tracks of a CD . The only one of Paul 's singles among them is Diana , while the remaining tracks include plenty of familiar songs including Secret love , I 've got my love to keep me warm , Love letters in the sand , You belong to me , Red sails in the sunset , Side by side , Your cheating heart and Jambalaya among others . It seems that the record label wanted to market the albums to an older albums to an older audience , leaving the singles for teenagers.The French-themed album occupies the remaining tracks on CD 1 . Many of the songs here are of French origin , though there are also some American songs with French themes . One of Paul 's singles , My heart sings , was itself a song of French origin and provided the album 's inspiration . This album clearly shows Paul 's love of French music , which came to the fore in the late sixties when he took Claude Francois ' hit Comme d'habitude and wrote English lyrics for it , calling his version My way.The second half of CD 2 is occupied by singles that were n't included in the three albums featured on this set . Stylistically different from the album tracks , there is still a lot of great music here , though the unlikely trio of Paul Anka , Johnny Nash ( still some years away from his own big hits ) and George Hamilton IV ( who had a brief career as a pop singer before settling for a country music career to which he was better suited ) have all delivered better music separately than they do together on Teen commandments of love . Perhaps the pick of these singles would be Put your head on my shoulder , Lonely boy and You are my destiny , though all are overshadowed by Diana.These days , Paul is remembered for Diana ( which he wrote ) and for My Way ( which many people give him full credit for writing , when he is only entitled to part of the credit ) but this compilation shows him to be a much more versatile performer ."}, "22211": {"id": "22210", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I can not believe I waited so long to order this ! !

The song may have a political , ecological focus , but that element , however important and worthy from the BB , falls away in respect to the philosophical and emotional power of the music and singing . `` Do n't Fight the Sea '' can mean so many things : do no resist the power of Nature , broadly defined ; do not resist truth and beauty , etc . It 's `` Do n't back down '' reimagined and `` aged '' 48 years later . There is a Taoist element to the thinking here , and the song is liberating .

Ra Ra Riot had a major element working against them : the untimely passing of John Pike , their original drummer and a great lyricist ( who penned various songs for The Rhumb Line ) . They also faced the possibility of a dreaded sophomore slump . Now , I 've read some early critiques of the album that say this is just more of the same from Ra Ra Riot ... but really , is that a bad thing ? Taking a closer look ... The Orchard - A haunting beginning to an eclectic chamber pop album , The Orchard works as a great intro and a fitting title track . ( 7/10 ) Boy - This rambunctious new single falls into the same camp as their catchy single , `` Can You Tell . '' It 's hard not to sing along with the relatable , yelped chorus where Wes shows off his boundless vocal range . It 's hard to disagree with this song . ( 10/10 ) Too Dramatic - A live staple turned recording , this song is instantly memorable for its catchy 80 's vocal melody ( and VERY 80 's keyboards ) . The staccato strings also chop in and out in very precise , deliberate strokes that demand attention . ( 9/10 ) Foolish - This song sounds classic to me . I almost feel like I heard it on the radio at some point a long time ago . That 's a very good sign . Everything just fits into place very well on this track . ( 10/10 ) Massachusetts - This overlong white-guy reggae song about Massachusetts falls short both lyrically and musically . It 's almost as if this song wanted to be something like `` Diplomat 's Son '' but relied too heavily on repetition . It 's not bad if you only listen to it for a couple minutes though . ( 5/10 ) You And I Know - Alexandra Lawn steps up to the mic to make her debut and she croons over the Renaissance Fair-synth with a low , jazzy voice . The ethereal backups that come in and out help round out the song . It 's a fine debut indeed . ( 8/10 ) Shadowcasting - This one chugs along at a reasonable pace and seems like it would be perfect for blasting out of your radio while driving around during the summer . ( 8/10 ) Do You Remember - The strings really seem to take center stage in this song . The breakdown with strings only draws attention to their intricacies . This song could very well signal the return of the `` soft rock '' genre , but in a good way . ( 8/10 ) Kansai - Great drumming throughout , and a bouncy bass line keeps this song fun . I think it needs to grow on me though . ( 6/10 ) Keep It Quiet - This is the album 's masterpiece . It begins very minimalistic and then a little more than halfway through , a Vampire Weekend-like guitar riff comes in with the violin and cello , making the song truly heart wrenching . [ I recommend everyone also check out the Boy Single version . ] ( 10/10 ) Overall , I think this album is a great representation of a band that is great at what they do and feel no need to give into gimmicks just to draw in trendy fair-weather fans.Thanks for reading !"}, "22217": {"id": "22216", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "What the hell 's the MATTER with you other reviewers ?

However , the CD IS the Carlos Santana that HE wanted to play , and you know what ? -- It is excellent.2 - Poor marketing decisions are the real problem here . The title at the top makes it look like a cheap , 99-cent TV special limited time offer . If you call within the next five minutes , you , too , can have Carlos Santana playing the hits of the decades . WHO designed this thing ? Worse , who decided to add that `` greatest guitar classics '' line as part of the title ? Talk about trashing the effort.3 - `` Guitar Heaven '' would possibly have served by itself as the title , except `` Guitar Heaven , '' to me , means long , uninterrupted lead breaks with minimal or no singing in the song whatsoever . This should have been called `` Rock Heaven '' or something . Bad , bad marketing.4 - According to a recent interview , there 's potential hope at the studio end for volumes II and even III of this thing . I would hope not . It 's a pleasant musical curiosity and an interesting artist divergency , but Carlos Santana needs to sound like himself . THAT 'S what we 're all waiting for out here . The REAL next CD.5 - A good thing about the CD -- The pretty orange CD face with the big Santana on it is reminiscent of the Carlos Santana/Buddy Miles Live cover . You almost do n't notice the silly title.6 - RE : The songs -- Every single one on here is very , very nicely done . They all do what I think they were intended to do , which is balance commercial covers with musical interpretation , some more so than others . How much wiggle room is there , really , in doing `` Whole Lotta Love ? '' You either do it or you don't.7 - Random comments -- Lead break on `` Knocking '' is nice ; `` Sunshine '' books right along ; Anybody who knocks this version of `` Weeps '' is n't listening ; `` Photograph '' rocks nicely ; NAS on `` Back in Black '' is superb ; `` Riders '' is more than nice , especially with Manzarek on board ; the Jon Lord tone and style organ on `` Smoke '' is very well done ; `` Dance '' is nice ; Bolan 's `` Gong '' is the ABSOLUTE TREAT of the album and worth the price of admission by itself ; `` Little Wing '' with Joe Cocker is untouchable -- an entire album between the two , now THAT would be interesting ; and `` Superstitious '' has all the flavor it 's supposed to.8 - Anyway , if you 're looking to hear the Carlos Santana `` OF '' LEGEND , this is NOT the CD you 're looking for.9 - However , if you 're looking to hear what `` THE '' LEGEND Carlos Santana is doing these days , this IS the CD for you .

It 's grand ! I do n't know what the naysayers were listening to when writing as they did , but it was n't this CD ! The first three tracks , Santana 's versions of Led Zeppelin 's `` Whole Lotta Love '' , the Rolling Stones ' monster , `` Ca n't You Hear Me Knocking ? `` , and the Eric Clapton/Cream classic , `` Sunshine of Your Love '' are worth buying `` Guitar Heaven '' for alone ! All three pack the wallop of an uppercut from a young Muhammad Ali . I thought that I was too tired of `` Smoke on the Water '' , that is , 'til Carlos ' magic breathed new life into it . The George Harrison/Beatles ' `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' remake is tender and soulful.Now , is this Carlos Santana 's best album ? That 's hardly a fair question , given his immense body of superb work , ( Santana I-III , Moonflower , Supernatuaral , amongst many more ) . Thus , the short answer is no , but `` Guitar Heaven '' is unquestionably one of my favorites.Yes , there are weak moments , but only a couple . I 'm not a fan of `` Back in Black '' , ( featuring Nas ) , because I truly believe that rap and hip-hop are the musical equivalent of urinating in the Holy Grail itself . I did n't care for `` Dance the Night Away '' , or `` Photograph '' , only because I 'm not a fan of those original tracks.Yet the rest of `` Guitar Heaven '' delivers pure gold : `` Riders on the Storm '' , `` Bang a Gong '' , `` Little Wing '' , ( of which Jimi would approve ) , and `` I Ai n't Superstitious '' , with the dynamic Jonny Lang , finish this bit of Heaven . `` Guitar Heaven '' *is* a great album !

'Chupacabra ' is like Zakk Wylde 's ERUPTION ! He shreds like crazy on this.Production - A ... In your face , guitars shredding above all and a good bass line bottom . The solo 's are incredibly clear.Songs - B+ ( for BLS ) ... These tracks rock out 80 % of the time . 'Darkest Days ' is one ballad though . Pretty draggy at that . 'Time Waits for No One ' is another that is a bit better . 'Shallow Grave'.. eehh . I know they put these tracks in for an attempt to give the disc more dimension , but they kind of do n't fit.Otherwise , the riffs and song structures work well and the solo 's kill it ! ! Great soloing throughout . Most important , the songs do n't drag or bore you . Standard in approach granted , but you do n't get tired . They flow well.Lyrics - B ... Good for his style , avg . to borderline impressive for this type of thing . Strength , power and the South ! Pretty good , or should I say good enough ! Originality - C ... Heard all the riffs before . Its BLS . Not trying to reinvent anything , just execute it well . Song structures do n't go too far out of their pattern . Though 'Southern Dissolution ' has some tempo changes that work real well.What makes the disc lose its 5 rating is the damn VOCALS ! I like Zakk , most of the times it works , but sometimes they just grate on ya . He has his style and you can feel the emotion , but sometimes you just wish he had another vocalist to rely on for a track or 2 . They do annoy me after a while . The over emphasis , the dragged out words and screeching falsetto highs are a little strong for the attempted ballads on here . 'Shallow Grave ' would be great with a different vocalist . Its a beautiful song , just that nasally vocal kills it at the bridge and chorus.And they are very loud in the mix to boot.I really think BLS would go further with a second vocalist to take another approach to a select song here and there . I have always thought this and still do . But 80 % of the time its fine . Zakk 's voice is good with this stuff , but it would n't hurt .

That is music he can look at five years from now . Maybe . I 'm not even sure I would want him singing Rodolfo just yet . His voice , which is actually quite beautiful , needs time to mature and grow naturally into whatever it is going to finally be . Judging from this recital and a couple of other things I have heard him in ( none , alas , in person ) he seems to be in the possession of a rather beautiful instrument , and seems to have a fair amount of musicality in his nature . So much the better.Signor Grigolo should continue to develop for the next few years in those smaller houses which dot the European continent .

Watch for the name to soon be on the lips of every lover of opera - especially the good old chestnuts from the Italian repertoire . Grigolio is only 33 - a fine age for a tenor to begin to sing the major roles - but he seems to have it all , from strikingly handsome good looks , soul , rather phenomenal stage presence , and a voice that can fill a huge hall or reduce an audience to utter silence as he almost whispers sotto voce phrases . This is an important recording because it allows us to have a starting point ( excluding the very popular recording 'Vittorio ' that offered love songs about four years ago - perfect for that young age ) . His technique in vocal production , the range of his voice that seems to find no strain , his immersion in the roles represented on this very generous sampling , and the above all the extraordinary beauty of the sound he produces are all in evidence on this recital . He is amazing : he seems ready to assume the mantle of the next great Italian tenor.This well engineered recording does n't have a weak track . The orchestra is the Teatro , Regio di Parma resident orchestra conducted by Pier Giorgio Morandi and while the orchestral sound is not the most opulent it is at all times in keeping with the colors of emotional range of Grigolo . The arias are all from the works of Donizetti , Verdi and Puccini and for now that narrow range seems fine . But instead of paying attention to the minutia , the major point here is to listen to the glories that come from this young gold mine of a tenor . No matter how many times we have heard 'Che gelida Manina ' or 'Una furtiva lacrima ' or 'E lucevan le stelle ' , hearing Grigolo makes them sound fresh and alive and transporting . The same can be said for all the arias he has elected to present to us as his first operating outing .

The voice for me is pleasant enough but has that breathy/gaspy aspect that can distract and I think Calleja is better for this class of voice . Its interesting to compare Vittorio 's version of Puccini 's 'Firenze & egrave ; come un albero fiorito ( from Gianni Schicchi ) ' with that of Juan Diego FlorezTenorto hear the marked difference and realise that he 's not really in Florez ' class . I was attracted to sample Vittorio 's music further after seeing him in the Rigoletto live in Mantua version of the opera , where he plays the Duke .

Even critics , who 've been less than fair and/or kind when it comes to acknowledging the band 's impact and importance in and on rock history , have started cutting the group some slack , begrudgingly granting them ( some of ) their just dues.All of this , coupled with the addition of Ben Mink as producer ( who did such a good job on Ann Wilson 's 2007 solo project HOPE & GLORY ) seemed to point to good things . The icing on the cake was the announcement that Nancy Wilson would be sharing more of the lead vocals , as well as the fact that there would be alot more harmonizing between the sisters.Sadly , most of this did not come to pass ... .Nancy only handles lead vocals on two tracks , the harmonies are pretty much nowhere to be found , and the production , while nice , is pretty run of the mill on many tracks . Toss in a handful of songs that are just O.K. , and RED VELVET CAR is an album that , while enjoyable , could have been so much more.The disc kicks things off with `` There You Go '' , arguably the best track on the album . Anchored by a slinky , sly arrangement , the instrumentation is minimal , but oh , so , powerful . However , it 's the vocals that really shine here ... Ann 's lead is sultry and strong , while Nancy 's harmonies are pitch perfect . Snaking in and around each other , this cut , more than any other , showcases what COULD have been . Brilliant ! I 'm not as big a fan of `` WTF . '' I certainly enjoyed the cut live , but it just does n't translate in it 's recorded version ... on the one hand , it seems like an unfinished demo . On the other , it seems like a blatant attempt to prove that , at 60 and 56 , the sisters can still ROCK . Weak lyrics and a so-so lead vocal just buttress the question `` This is the first single ? ! ? `` Next up is the disc 's atmospheric title track . Awash with a killer lead vocal , an alternately sweeping and intimate arrangement and pristine instrumentation , `` Red Velvet Car '' is one of those tracks where it all just comes together . Complete with thoughtful lyrics ( `` So pull your weary bones inside/You can sleep when I drive '' ) , `` Red Velvet Car '' is a definite high point.Both `` Red Velvet Car '' and the following track , `` Queen City '' , could have easily fit on any one of the first four or five Heart albums . Full of rock & roll attitude ~ `` swagger '' is the best way to describe Ann 's lead vocal ~ the track actually has an acoustic core , which just adds to it 's overall cool vibe . Yes , points are deducted for some weak lyrics , but it still ultimately lands in the `` Win '' column ! Ditto `` Hey You '' , the first of Nancy 's lead vocals . A folk-tinged acoustic strummer , the lilt in Wilson 's voice is just downright captivating . By the time things get to the `` Na , na , na , na , na '' bridge , well , it 's just magic ! This cut is sweet , seductive , simple and sassy , all rolled together . And I just LOVE the line `` Until the darkness and the light/Decide to rhyme ! '' Definitely gives `` There You Go '' a run for it 's money as my favorite cut on RVC ! '' Wheels ? '' Not so much . The second half of RED VELVET CAR is really rather hit-and-miss , and this track is a prime example of that . It 's not that the song is bad , it 's just ... eh . The arrangement is somewhat generic , while Ann 's lead vocal is decent at best . The lyrics are nothing special either , so , in the end , you have a cut that 's basically just filler . And with only ten tracks on the whole album , well , that 's absolutely unacceptable . `` Safronia 's Mark '' fares much better ... there 's a quirky edginess to the song that 's exhilerating . Part `` Dog & Butterfly '' , part `` Kick It Out '' , the arrangement is downright hypnotic , while Ann 's vocal dances over the picturesque lyrics ( `` Suddenly she 's standing there before you/Reaching out her arms just like a child/Her face is like a door you want to walk through/Cause something deep inside just might belong to you '' ) . Another one of RVC 's true gems ! `` Death Valley '' falls into the `` Miss '' column ... .once again , it seems like the sisters are trying to PROVE they can ROCK ( Ladies , you do n't have to `` prove '' anything ... that was all made clear years ago ! ) . Bloated , cliched , dull ... this is one of the disc 's biggest missteps . What works on stage does n't always translate to recordings.The exact opposite can be said about `` Sunflower '' , Nancy 's second lead vocal ... .the song is fresh , dynamic and fun . Blessed with an airy arrangement , a sweet , yet smoldering lead and gorgeous harmony vocals , it all comes together perfectly , resulting in a track that just pulls you in . Add smart lyrics to the mix ( `` Sunflower/Never steal your eyes away/Even when the seasons change/A little sun - a little rain '' ) and you have exactly what RVC needed more of.Things wrap up with `` Sand '' , an almost note-for-note rerecording of a track from the Wilson 's 1997 Lovemongers side project , WHIRLYGIG . If you 're going to rerecord a song , especially one of your own , you have to add something new to it , freshen it up , change things around . On an album that 's already pretty short , with some what of a hit-and-miss vibe , to not do so just seems kind of ... .chintzy . Or lazy.And that 's one of the saddest things about RED VELVET CAR ... .Ann and Nancy Wilson have NEVER been lazy . They proved long ago that they are true rockers , with a lot to say and contribute to the world of rock . Here 's hoping the next Heart album allows them to stretch a bit more , providing us with a Cadillac-esque vehicle , versus a sedan .

But the rest of the album is just as good - the music manages to sound like a throwback and something brand new at the same time . Great vocals from both singers . Even the ballads are catchy . I have n't been this into a complete album ( vs one or two songs ) in a long time ! They 're playing the Telluride Blues and Brews this year so I 'll definitely be catching them there ."}, "22267": {"id": "22266", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This ablum is purely epic .

Not the artificial soul of what passes for modern R & B ; I mean real stuff that comes from the gut . JJ Grey 's new CD `` Georgia Warhorse '' is one of the most soulful albums I 've heard in a long time.Let me start with my favorites . `` Got ta Know '' is a slow and sensitive ballad that crescendos into a powerful guspel-filled jam . `` Hide and Seek '' is some serious swamp rock with a killer guitar riff and hook . `` Georgia Warhorse '' provides some great swamp blues about - what else ? - the indestructible insect that the song is named after . `` Sweetest Thing '' reminds me of the type of mid-tempo soul that Otis Redding might do ( and Grey 's voice is very comparable ) .Really , all the songs on this CD are quite different but there is n't one that is a `` filler . '' They are all quite good and Gray 's raspy vocals combined with the songs ' semi-raw production make this a real treat to listen to.If you are a fan of old ( new ) soul a la Marc Broussard , JJ Grey and Mofro 's `` Georgia Warhorse '' will be right up your alley ."}, "22270": {"id": "22269", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Definitely a `` swampy '' soul band .

His lingering problem , however , has been promotion . Since his debut album `` Country Boy '' in 1999 , he has released great product , but left the labels constantly clueless on how to market him . He is very much a `` middle of the road '' kind of artist . He has one foot in neo-soul and the other in contemporary R & B ; , and meets the two somewhere in between . He is revered in the `` chitlin circuit '' , but is n't exactly a Southern Soul performer . Strangely enough , his lack of promotion at major labels has worked to his advantage . On an independent , he has more creative control as a singer , songwriter and producer . Before you look at it as a bad thing , consider this : Calvin 's biggest hit was `` Keep On Pushin ' '' - a song that he solely wrote and produced.On his fifth album- and third for the Shanachie label- `` America 's Most Wanted '' , Calvin is in the producer 's seat for the second time , following 2008 's criminally underrated `` When Love Comes '' . The album is n't a political record , if you judge it on the title . Actually , the title track `` America 's Most Wanted '' is about him dating a supermodel . The only song that actually deals with social commentary is the track `` Monday Morning '' . On this effort , he goes for completely live instrumentation , which is a complement to Calvin 's voice as well as his choice of material . On the song `` Never Do You Wrong '' , he reassures his significant other about his fidelity , despite the negative perception of musicians on the road . `` Feels Like We 're Sexin ' '' finds him being sexually aroused by a female dancing partner . He decides to turn his life around for his partner on the song `` Thug Livin ' '' . Though most of this album is ballad heavy , the only uptempo songs are `` You Possess My Body '' and the closing track `` Paradise '' . The verdict on this album ? `` America 's Most Wanted '' is Calvin Richardson 's best album , hands down ."}, "22284": {"id": "22283", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 'm a Brian Simpson fan , and this South Beach release is very nice all the way through the CD.Look forward to hearing what he releases next !"}, "22285": {"id": "22284", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "El DeBarge 's first album in 16 years delivers !

The one thing that can make digesting Disturbed challenging at times is how they borrow from themselves so often ... so many riffs , songs , and especially vocal passages are reminiscent of things they have done in the past . BUT ... great is great so I personally do not see reason to use the similarity to prior works as a significant negative . The twists on Asylum for me are found in the guitarwork ... . Dan Donegan just keeps growing and getting better and better as a writer and more intricate with his lead guitar work . All other instruments ( drums , vocals , bass are the classic style and expectations of quality that Disturbed deliver routinely ) ... but the guitar really has taken progressive steps more and more over time . The first album was mostly all rhythm and no lead ... this album , like Indestructible keeps the inspired and unique rhythm parts but infuses more lead over the top . To me Indestructible brought Donegan really riffing things up with the lead showing that he can hang with the Avenged Sevenfolds out there . This one , sort of brings out the old classic Judas Priest melodic inspired and memorable solo lines . It is very throwback classic in that sense . Great patterns ... I listen and think this album was possibly constructed to be a jammer for Rock Band usage ... it full of riffs that stand out because they are melodic more than just being blisteringly fast . This work is even evident on the great intro track to the album which slowly builds up into the first song . So , it is really the guitar work here that really makes this a stand out album for me . But , I must point out , that is no knock on the rest , Disturbed continue to have very distinguished and unique vocals and , to me , the best drum work out there . They are the perfect blend of unique , modern and classic all rolled in to one ... as they were from the start . Disturbed command attention and are one of the key saviors in modern metal bands that prove metal is alive and well and growing.As I often feel with the 5 star rating system ... I am not comfortable giving this only a 4 star rating though I am not sure I would give it a full 5 if I could give a 4.5 . So , out of fairness , I believe I should round up in these situations . My favorite songs here include the intro through the title track , The Animal and Another Way to Die , but I do like all the other original songs too . The song I like the least , by far , is the bonus track cover song ... not nearly as good as their other cover songs of the past ... I just do n't think that song really shines with the Disturbed treatment and I am not much of a U2 fan overall either .

When I finish , I will proceed to jot down my thoughts on each track.Okay as of now I 'm ripping the album , so I have enough time to post on what I just listened to.Remnants- Pretty damn good intro I must say . It 's nothing special but it does fit the mood and I do n't have any complaints about it . That 's for sure ; good guitar work from Dan.Asylum- Having listened to this song since it was released on the internet , I definitely was n't disappointed . I mean , I listened to Another Way to Die first which was n't bad ; it was just pretty generic . However , Asylum kicks in with that evil laugh from previous single `` Inside the Fire '' and a kick ass riff . Dave shouts `` Release me ! '' as he then begins to break out in an aggressive spew of agony-inspired lyrics . This definitely reminds you of the Sickness days and is currently fighting `` Haunted '' for favorite song of all time.Infection- From viewing other reviews , some people seemed not to like this one . It 's only major fault is its repetitiveness , in my opinion . As much as David sings `` *insert something* must die ! `` , you 'd think he wrote this song in his sleep . However , it has an incredibly heavy riff and is full of adrenaline . It has more of `` crude '' sound to it like Disturbed always had . Definitely no clean-cut riffs here . However , I 'm loving his harmonizing vocals here ; as repetitive as they are , I 'm having a hard time keeping them out of my head ... . not that I 'm trying to ; ) Anyways enough said here ; ripping should be done and moving on to the rest of the album ! Please proceed to play some pretty elevator music while you 're waiting for me to finish what looks like another Disturbed-masterpiece.Warrior- Oh , man ! I 'm loving this opening riff . You start off introduced with some great adrenaline-filled guitar work from Danny . Afterwards , Dave follows up with some of his most aggressive vocals yet ! Extremely rough , but in that good way . When it kicks into the chorus , I 'm not paying too much attention to the lyrics as it all just fits great together ... . but what I can hear from the lyrics , they do n't seem to bad . I 'm definitely loving this song . If the rest of the album is like this and is the reason why `` Infection '' is rated so poorly , I do n't see myself being disappointed.Another Way to Die- More Disturbed goodness . If you 're a fan , you 've definitely should 've heard this track by now . You should 've heard it by this VERY early summer . Anyways , it seemed very generic when I heard it back then . However , whoever mixed it on the album did an incredible job . I would n't say it holds a candle to some of the other tracks I 've heard so far , but it definitely does n't sound generic anymore . Anyways , for the most part this song starts out with a melodic intro of Dave 's vocals and some doom-hopeful guitar-work from Dan . From here on out , it 's the same-old Disturbed but the drums have more of a Thrash-Metal influence . The bass is good here . Honestly , nothing wrong with this track . Just not the strongest on the album . Good work guys ! Never Again- Once again , a REALLY good riff compared to past Disturbed albums . There 's no doubt this was a really good effort by the band , but they may have tried too hard . I 'm loving the song , but Dave 's bursting out with really fat-paced vocals while Danny for the most part offers a slower-paced riff . All the members provide some really solid work here . The only problem is they do n't sync as well as they COULD have . That is a small complaint however , as the song is still very good . Awesome solo from our man , Dan here . You can tell he 's definitely improving his guitar-work.The Animal- Interesting intro here . Has more of an electronic sound ... . well until now ; the song kicked in . This sounds promising here ! The beginning definitely reminds you of `` Down with the Sickness '' and the majority of the song has somewhat of a Thrash/Industrial/Disturbed sound to it . I just got to the solo and it was pretty short , but it was still good nonetheless . If I had to pick just ONE reason we always loved Danny , it would be his ability to write solos without feeling the need to show off . It 's still good guitar-work , but it 's major stand-out here is how unique it sounds ! Very haunting and has a more of a `` creepy '' sound to it . My biggest complaint here is VERY similar to the last one . Dave 's the only member trying a little too hard here as he incorporates almost every single one of his past-singing styles into the song here . For the most part , it goes together pretty well here . However , when he goes into the chorus he goes from his extremely aggressive and rough voice ( i.e . Fear or Intoxication ) to his more melodic higher-pitched and extended vocals ( Such as Prayer or Stricken ) . It 's not bad and believe me , it sounds GOOD . The transition just sounds a little awkward . The only fix for that would give it the more `` generic '' sound from past Disturbed albums . Personally , when comparing the two possible 'problems ' , I 'd say this is the lesser of two evils . Still an awesome song and I REALLY enjoyed it.Crucified- The opening riff is once again , very heavy . Almost sounds like something from Alice in Chains . Dave has good vocals here as usual . The guitar work is definitely a stand-out here ; if a bit subtle . That `` Alice in Chains '' -like riff may seem a little weird with Dave 's singing style here but both are very enjoyable . I think the best way to enjoy this song would be to focus on the guitar or the vocals separately . Both are outstanding , but may seem a little `` off '' when put together . I just got to the breakdown and it 's pretty good ; will remind you alot of `` Enough '' . It looks Danny 's breaking out a more high-pitched guitar sound than he 's used to after the breakdown . It 's really good from here on out and definitely syncs with the vocals well . Good song ; for the first beginning half it 's enjoyable with a few SLIGHT `` wtf '' moments here and there . After the breakdown , it all picks up and band brings it together and the song gets better than it already is.Serpentine- Beautiful riff here ; full of emotion . Dave offers some of his most beautiful heart-felt vocals than ever ! I 'm only in the beginning of the song and it 's already great . I now got to the chorus and I think this may be one of the strongest tracks on the album . Johnny just now delivered a kickass bass riff and after I heard it , I now find it easier to hear now that I 'm paying attention to it as well as the rest of the song . REALLY great effort here guys ! ! ! Am loving the breakdown ; definitely well-thought out . The only problem here is how much I 'm enjoying the song . I can find this being a `` One more time ... . '' rinse and repeat . Beautiful song , guys ! Some of their best work.My Child- Was a little disappointed when I first heard this . When I heard the sample during the Uproar tour advertisements , this was my most anticipated track . However , now that I 've listened to it enough , I definitely enjoy it . The only problem here is that with a subject so sensitive to Dave , I figured it 'd FEEL a little more sensitive . Oh , well ; good track nonetheless . Has more of a Thrash feel with the instrumentals and has Dave 's `` rap '' style vocals from the `` The Sickness '' ... . except for the chorus where Dan plays extended riffs and Dave begins to hold his notes as well ... . probably the most heart-felt part of the song . The breakdown 's really good here as well.Sacrifice- The riff here sounds kind of like something from Pantera 's `` Walk '' . Dave delivers his more melodic vocals once again . It all fits together well . The melody and rhythm in this track is great here . It kind of makes me think of `` Stricken '' and `` Facade '' but with this particular album 's feel to it . Daves vocals gradually get more and more aggressive and pissed off as the song progresses . Great pace . The solo once again is good ... . actually , it 's great ! Dan 's most impressive work yet , I 'd have to say . It starts out kinda slow and sounds alot like the one in `` The Animal '' . However , when it kicks in , Dan gives it his all . Great song ! Innocence- As the last track on the album , it really has a `` Thrash '' sound to it , much like the rest . Thrash + Melody = Profit ! Dave starts out with some of his roughest vocals here ; all for the better . The song has an amazing intro to the breakdown ; just listened to it and am currently on the breakdown now ... . Well Dave , Dan and John are n't too hot here . They 're good , but not the stand-out . So who does that leave ? ? ? That 's right ; Mikey on the drums ! ! ! The rest of the song once again picks up as it started.Well , there 's an `` untitled '' track and two live tracks left . Since we already know what `` Stricken '' and Down with the Sickness are , I wo n't need to comment on those . Now for the untitled track : For some reason the song does n't start until about 1.5 minutes in . It really starts off with some non-Disturbed sounding riff . Now I 'm curious as to if this song is a cover . Once Dave 's vocals kicked in , it sounds like NOTHING Disturbed would ever write . Good song , though . The only problem is it sounds a little too happy than what Dave 's vocals have sang in the past . Dan offers a good solo here . Honestly , if someone finds out what this song is , I 'd say it 's the weakest song on the album . Great instrumentals . The only part I 'm not too sure about are the vocals . Considering David Draiman 's singing , when something about them does n't work you just KNOW it was n't been written by Disturbed . During the chorus when he sings `` I 'm still have n't found what I 'm looking for '' , however , he really does prove his vocal potential . It 's just other parts in the song where his vocals sound awkward.Anyways , it 's overall a really great album . I just finished it and like the past four albums , it has its own distinctive sound . I 've mentioned that particular sound a lot . That 's right ; thrash with melody and Disturbed 's own little twists . I 'm not sure where I 'd rank among the past albums as I 'll have to give it about a week of listening . Nevertheless , it is DEFINITELY Disturbed 's best instrumental work yet and you can tell they gave it their all on `` Asylum '' ."}, "22303": {"id": "22302", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Asylumis every bit as much a Disturbed album as 2008'sIndestructible . Disturbed pound through every bit of ASYLUM providing an enjoyable , though not revolutionary effort . The album is clich & eacute ; metal with strong , anthemic choruses that often namecheck the title of the song for the fan 's cohesion sake . The beginning of the album lays better than the end , but that is typical of so many efforts today . I believe part of that is that Disturbed 's best , most cutting edge material appears at the forefront . Do n't get me wrong , there is nothing here that is bad by any means , but after a while , the album grows a bit `` same-y '' if you catch my drift.The album opens up strongly with `` Remnants , '' an instrumental cut that builds in intensity and instrumentation . The grand guitar work here foreshadows what is to be a sick display of guitar solos and unabashedly strong guitar riffs . Title cut `` Asylum '' follows , proving to be the ` cream of the crop ' cut of the album opening with a fine bass-driven groove . Often times title cuts disappoint , but `` Asylum , '' much like `` Indestructible '' from Indestructible proves to be a key listen . The refrain for `` Asylum '' is well crafted as far as songwriting appeal and the guitar work is jagged and desirable , archetypical of metal . While `` Asylum '' is by no means the second coming , it is a solid cut and one of the best from this album of the same name . `` The Infection '' is equally as alluring as `` Asylum '' if no moreso . Here frontman David Draiman 's vocals are slightly more present and balanced within the production , adding additional clarity to his vocals . A nice production touch here is a second layer of vocals towards the end of the track which further solidifies `` The Infection 's '' star power on Asylum . Cuts `` Warrior '' and `` Another Way To Die '' are both equally clever , though not revolutionary , though they fall a shade lower in my opinion in comparison to stronger cuts `` Asylum '' and `` The Infection . '' `` Warrior '' like preceding cuts contains strong guitar riffs and a catchy refrain while `` Another Way To Die '' benefits from a slow introduction followed by the typical driving tempi that characterize Disturbed as a band . `` Never Again '' does n't quite live up to the best of ASYLUM , but it was another standout cut in my mind . Here , slight musical changes ( changing meters occasionally ) and a solid refrain differentiate this track slightly from others . `` The Animal '' is not as solid in my mind , but with some key changes in production ( an introduction created with synthesizers , a couple of ` blue ' notes within the guitar , etc . ) , it is enjoyable despite being flawed . `` Crucified '' was n't a favorite either , with a slightly weaker chorus in my mind than other cuts , but the cut ends strong and is by no means bad . `` Serpentine '' and `` My Child '' are good , if ` Grade B ' cuts in my opinion while penultimate cut `` Sacrifice , '' like `` Crucified '' is merely average . Closing cut `` Innocence '' restores some of the former greatness of ASYLUM , but does n't make this ` good ' album a ` great ' one.Overall , Disturbed fans will be pleased with this effort I 'm sure . The pounding drums and jagged guitar riffs are much appreciated by all listeners and some of the nuances of this album show some great musicianship on the part of Disturbed . With that said , while the front end of this effort is very strong , the end falls flatter in my eyes and I do n't believe that portion of the album would woo new fans by any means . I have no doubt ASYLUM will perform solidly on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart , despite any of its critical flaws . 3 1/2 stars ; Solid , though not revolutionary ."}, "22304": {"id": "22303", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "ASYLUM is trademark Disturbed with a couple of twists and turns.If you know Disturbed you will pick them up in certain songs.If you have been with them from the beginning and like all their stuff , there is no reason to stop here.Get it now.From beginning to end , Draiman hits you with his trademark vox and their addicting sound.Asylum , Warrior , Another Way To Die , The Animal , Serpentine , My Child and Innocence highlight this effort.There is even a hidden track around a minute and 39 sec . into the 13 slot.U-2 's `` I Still Have n't Found What I 'm Looking For '' .If you know Disturbed , they have done covers before , very good ones at that and this one hits the spot with me too.Being a big U-2 fan as well , Disturbed handles the song in their own way and give much respect to the original.So what you waiting for ? ? ?

It is all white , with the word & # 34 ; LENNON & # 34 ; emblazoned in blue sky/cloud motif on top of all that white . When you slip slide the top of the box off ( tight , the way an iPhone box would breathe open mid-pace ) , you see a greeting : FROMYOKOJULIANSEANPersonal messages from the three surviving Lennons . Below that is a hardcover book , white with the word & # 34 ; Yes & # 34 ; emblazoned on it in blue . The booklet has an essay and photos.Below it are John Lennon 's eight CDs , and one singles and rarities collection : Each of them contains a thick and glorious booklet that include photos , essays and lyrics.Once your fantasy has taken in all this glorious media , you can note the side of the inner box , which has a nice portrait of John and Yoko ( full body ) on one side , and an abstract concept of their faces on the other.Finally , at the bottom , there 's a drawer that contains a gorgeous print of a drawing of John and Yoko sitting under a tree . Nice.The square white book that comes with the set is a gorgeous little thing , with the word & # 34 ; yes & # 34 ; inlaid in blue in what seems to be John 's handwriting . It contains 60 pages of photos and writings on John Lennon , with some lyrics , doodles and artwork . Many of the photos are of John and Yoko together , and there are some of John before he met Yoko ; there are no pictures of John 's two sons . John is in every picture in the book except a picture of a Ringo Starr album cover , inexplicably included here . There 's a great picture of the bed-in that is followed by a pen drawing of the scene . My favourite picture is of John and Yoko at Giza , with the pyramids in the background . The essay is not bad , as it gives saucy quotes from John angry about people 's expectations of him , or their poor opinions of Yoko ( and , by extension then , of him too ) , but it also re-tells some of the stories that are in the individual album booklets . Some of the typography is not great , as a few lines drift out of the left column . On pages 7 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 20 , 44 , 45 , 48 and 56 this problem exists . Is this some sort of code ?

The result is a collection of very similar songs that she is able to bring to life.The accompaniment here is provided by the Private Musicke - six stringed instruments and percussion - that allows the rather hollow sound of this music to radiate around Kozen & aacute ; 's voice .

Only through listening on a CD can you truly hear the songs with Eltons piano on your left speaker , Leon 's on your right .

What we get is one of the best Country Rock and Roll albums ever made . I am not a fan of country at all but this is just fantastic music anyone can enjoy . The use of pianos , horns , and back up singers make this sound like one of the most epic records ever recorded . Unlike his last few records all the songs were recorded live ( and on analog devices , not digital ) and the energy is really drawn out . We have some upbeat western songs ( Hey Ahab , Jimy Rodger 's Dream , Monkey Suit ) , some deeply dark songs ( Gone to Shiloh , THere 's no Tommorow ) Ballads ( Eight HUndred Dollar Shoes , I should have sent Roses ) and anything else a great record could ask for and more .

The documentary DVD I was definitely looking forward to but WHAT , it 's the same 6 and a half minute video that was posted to fans a month ago . This is false advertising to say it includes I making of documentary by Cameron Crowe as this is WAY too short . It is also a huge waste of a DVD disc . If this was any other CD I would feel really angry and ripped off but luckily the CD was excellent enough to make me forget about that DVD . So save your self some cash and buy the regular version .

The highs are possibly boosted a bit too much ; maybe Broadrick is suffering from tinnitus after nearly 30 years of extreme music ? The lows , however , are where the remaster really shines . The thunder that this album has always deserved is now there on the disk instead of being left on the master tapes.The second CD is fairly underwhelming . The `` unreleased mixes '' are all nearly identical , with the main difference being some alternate drum samples ( the snare sounds a lot higher ) . The live/rehearsal tracks are very , very rough recordings , especially Dream Long Dead which sounds it was recorded on a Sony Walkman . The most interesting tracks are by far the two Tiny Tears demos . Stripped down to the basics , these tracks show off a lot of melodies that are later obscured by the ( intentional ) waves of distortion in the final mixes.Overall , if you are buying this album for the first time it is absolutely worth it to pick up this release .

Following in the vein of Hissing Fauna , Are You The Destroyer ? and Skeletal Lamping , False Priest is an eclectic mix of funky indie pop and spazzy R & B ; jams . Of Montreal has changed significantly since its Beatles-esque first incarnation , the obvious turning point being Satanic Panic in the Attack , which was perhaps the first point at which Barnes successfully synthesized his varied tastes into an engaging and exciting piece of work . On Hissing Fauna , he chronicled his personal transformation through a difficult point in his life , coming out on the other side of The Past is a Grotesque Animal as the sexually empowered Georgie Fruit . He then gave full control to his fickle muse on Skeletal Lamping , a product with a handful of truly brilliant moments surrounded by schizophrenic fluff , which tends to play out a little too long and a little too obtuse to have staying power . Following Skeletal Lamping , False Priest sees Barnes scaling back his insanity , instead carefully dialing it in to hit on a compelling blend of creativity and precision , the latter of which was very much lacking from Skeletal Lamping.Opener I Feel Ya ' Stutter has some of the aforementioned schizo elements from Skeletal Lamping , but I think that as on Hissing Fauna , False Priest chronicles a transformation from Georgie Fruit back into a new hybrid character , someone with both the creativity and the pop sensibilities . Coquet Coquette has a bit of a Led Zeppelin stomp to it , which deep , billowing guitars and a driving rhythm section . The contributions of Janelle Monae and Solane Knowles on Enemy Gene and Sex Karma respectively are not to be overlooked . Two of the album 's strongest tracks , the former has a powerful note of self doubt and introspection while the latter absolutely oozes sexuality.Hissing Fauna , through my ears , was unquestionably Kevin Barnes ' opus , and I do n't suspect that he 's going to ever top it without his life being thrown into serious turmoil again , but that 's ok , because after the growing pains of Skeletal Lamping , Barnes has found his stride , effectively creating a record that sounds entirely like Of Montreal while still refusing to play it safe ."}, "22348": {"id": "22347", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The title of this review says it all and `` All We Need '' is Oli to keep making music like this .

Combining elements of progressive metal , death metal , and ambient styles in a unique and innovative mix , they have proven they are truly a force to be reckoned with and are destined to be masters of the genre.The Contortionist 's debut EP , Shapeshifter , was extremely based in deathcore and breakdowns . The following EP , Apparition , eased up on the deathcore elements for a much more progressive sound . Vocalist/keyboardist Dave Hoffman left after these releases , and was replaced by Jonathan Carpenter , with the lineup being rounded out by guitarists Robby Baca and Cameron Maynard , bassist Chris Tilley , and drummer Joey Baca . This lineup released their full length debut , Exoplanet , which continued down the proggy styling of their EP , with several of the songs being reworked for the release.Exoplanet is an extremely strong debut release . It features everything you 'd want from a progressive death metal album . It has intense vocals balanced with melodic singing ( complete with a vocoder effect akin to the legendary Cynic ) , intense riffs interloped with clean melodies , prominent bass-lines , and impressive , polyrhythmic drumming.Highlights : '' Primal Directive '' is the opening track . It features a taste of what you can expect with the remainder of the album . A particular noteworthy point is the `` You have been defined '' vocoder cleans being layered over the screams during the chorus . `` Flourish '' is one of The Contortionist 's most known songs , for good reason . It begins with frenetic technical riffage before flowing into further intensity . Approximately two minutes in , however , the song changes drastically into a melodic segment that would n't sound out of place on an Explosions in the Sky album . This climaxes into a beautiful solo followed by a breathtaking guitar harmony . Easily one of the best songs on the album . `` Vessel '' opens with a soothing ambient intro but then segues into more intensity . More great guitar melodies abound within this song . `` Oscillator '' is also in the running for best song . First half is intense , full of breakdowns and growls . However , a third into the song , is a melodic guitar solo and a refrain from the heaviness . The second half is purely instrumental , and more breathtaking melodies that sound at home on a post-rock release.The `` Exoplanet '' suite , however , is by far the biggest highlight of the album . The first segment , `` Egress , '' opens with more post-rock-esque riffs over a smooth bassline . It picks up the pace with vocoded singing over a melodic guitar lead before transitioning into screamed vocals . `` Void '' is a heavier part , that has more of what makes this album great , interloping intensity and melody , and containing mesmerizing guitar leads . `` Light '' is the final piece , beginning with even more atmospheric post-rock riffage . It transitions into final bits of intensity , before an outro of ambient sound effects.The verdict : Exoplanet is a phenomenal release from this young band . They would manage to top it with their sophomore release Intrinsic ( which I have previously reviewed ) . However this is still an incredible album .

While I do n't really know what this band sounded like previously , the short clips I 've heard have convinced me that they have matured and improved as songwriters , and the vocals of Kazu Makino are less obtuse now , generally fitting the mood ( and moodiness ) of the songs better than on `` 23 '' . If I had to describe this unique band to someone , I guess I would say it 's a little bit of Sneaker Pimps and UNKLE , mixed with some Hooverphonic and a good deal of quirkiness !

First and foremost : it 's a production-oriented album . The crackling gothic guitar harmonies and snappy bass-lines we 've become familiar with on previous albums have taken a back seat to methodic , ominously-layered arrangements . Instead , we see the band relying more than ever on a detached synth-ambiance and the icy , multitracked vocal work of Paul Julian Banks to flesh out the hollow skeleton of dark rockers that make up this album.Due to their overwhelming subtlety , it 's very easy to miss how much time and energy must have gone into arranging the vocals on this album ( the number of vocal tracks on Always Malaise alone would be enough to exhaust Freddie Mercury himself ) , but the minor keys , half-steps , and deadpan delivery remain true to any of PJB 's best moments.What is n't subtle -- in any way -- is the melange of album art rendering a 3D image of the band 's name being blown to smithereens by an unseen force . Some might be inclined to interpret this as the band foreshadowing its own break-up . This is , apparently , the last Interpol record that will feature the band 's original bassist and keyboard player .

Even with this excellent track record , LIVE IN BOSTON 1966 still stands out from the crowd . Recorded just one year after the seminal HOODOO MAN BLUES album , it finds Junior at the top of his game as a performer of the blues . Backed by the Aces , Junior tears through a twelve-song set with the passion , intensity and humor that made him one of the finest of all bluesmen . His singing is full of energy and conviction , his harp playing is punchy and tight , and the Aces provide great grooves to support Junior 's craft . Listening to Junior romp through classics like `` Got My Mojo Working '' or his own `` Junior 's Whoop '' is a treat , while his between-songs banter adds to the feeling of being at a live Junior Wells show.Though the music certainly stands tall on its own merits , one should not underestimate the importance of the choices made by the label , Delmark , in making this a truly great disc . Many live albums which feature great performances are marred or ruined by misguided attempts to clean up the sound , haphazard attempts to cut and paste tracks to get the best songs together , and overdubs to hide mistakes .

Although this catalogue should be sufficient , the typical blues aficionado still craves for more.Thanks to Delmark records , `` Live in Boston 1966 '' has finally seen the light of day . This CD is a rich and rewarding Blues listening experience . It represents one of Junior Wells finest live club dates.1966 , found Junior at the peak of his powers . He already had 13 years as a performing and recording artist under his belt . His chops were well established both as a prominent member of Muddy Waters band ( replacing Little Walter , no less ) as well as both a solo and collaborating artist . This `` Live in Boston 1966 `` set is unique , in that it found him reunited with the Aces . A band of working musicians which had commercial and critical acclaim during the fifties.By the mid sixties , Junior was experiencing wide global recognition and appreciation . Thank to a best selling album '' Hoodoo Man Blues `` and the public acknowledgment of his influence on the British Invasion . U.K. bands , e.g. , Stones , Animals , etc , were shining the light on authentic blues artists and enthusiastically crediting these musicians with fostering their success . These bands hired artists such as Junior Wells , to open for national tours.The `` Live in Boston 1966 : CD consists of 11 numbers plus closing theme . The seven stage raps sprinkled in between the numbers totals approximately 12 minutes . Anyone fortunate enough to attend one of Junior 's gigs knows how entertaining these moments were when J.W . established a genuine rapport with the audience . During the later part of his career , these stage raps could prove excessive and awkward depending how free the spirits were flowing . I 'm happy to report this is n't the case with this release.The song selection is impeccable . It ranges from soulful ballads ( That 's All right ) , jump tunes ( Hideaway ) , all the way to blues jams ( Junior 's Whoop ) . The old chestnuts like `` Messin with the Kid `` and `` Got my Mojo Workin `` are included . However , since this is 1966 , the sounds resonate as fresh , vibrant and kick ass . Junior 's vocals are in top form and his harp work is slammin throughout the set . He leaves plenty of room for the Aces to demo their contributions , This is particularly evident with numbers as `` Hideaway , ' Got My Mojo Workin '' and Junior 's Whoop `` .Louis Myers ( guitar ) , Dave Myers ( bass ) and Fred Below ( Drums ) deliver an exceptional set . Junior and the Aces are truly a first tier Blues band entity not just a solo artist with a pickup band . The sound mix , for a mid sixties club date , is spot on . It provides a very intimate club listening experience . You can almost smell the whiskey , smoke and sweat that were always in play in those small urban blues bars during the sixties.Hats off to Robert G. Koester and Steve Wagner for album and CD production , respectively .

This is the band Wells began playing with in the 50 's , recording some fine sides for the States label.A number of songs will be familiar to blues listeners- '' Worried Life Blues '' ( Sleepy John Estes ) , `` That 's All Right '' ( Jimmy Rogers ) , `` Look On Yonder 's Wall '' ( Arthur Crudup ) , `` Messin ' With The kid '' ( A Wells ' favorite ) , `` Hideaway '' ( Freddie King ) , and so on . But do n't let the fact that familiar tunes means a lazy , sloppy performance-far from it . Wells is at his best here , and the band ( especially Louis Meyers ' guitar work ) is never less than solid , and sometimes they smolder under Wells ' leadership . And speaking of Wells-his harp work is typically gritty and in your face , while at other times he uses his instrument to punctuate his insistent vocals . All in all-a fine performance . Between tunes , Wells chats with the audience , which some listeners will find annoying . I find it enhances the live feel , and brings a little bit of the `` you are there '' feel to the recording . After hearing his comments-they can be programmed out-to each his own.For anyone who likes Junior Wells ' work from the 50 's through the 60 's , purchasing this set is a no-brainer . If you 're new to Wells ' brand of blues-purchase his early 50 's sides ( `` Blues Hit Big Town '' ) , his 60 's releases `` Hoodoo Man Blues '' and `` Southside Blues Jam '' first , and then purchase this set-which is icing on the cake . Junior Wells was one of the important blues artists who brought authentic electric Chicago blues to a generation ( including myself ) of listeners who were just discovering this wonderful music . And this release is even more proof that Junior Wells and his band could deliver the real thing when it came to the blues . This set belongs in everyone 's library of modern electric/Chicago/Junior Wells blues ."}, "22402": {"id": "22401", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "A very good cd from Hey Monday .

That would be cool , and in this day & age , more acts are releasing a string of EPs in a calendar year rather than 1 full album once every 2-3 years ... not only Hey Monday , but also cool punky Swedish dancepop queen Robyn 's `` Body Talk '' EPs and country rocker Blake Shelton with his `` Six-Pack '' series . Hey , I 'll take 3 Hey Monday EPs with tunes this good ! ! ! Cassadee has the perfect girlpop voice , the band rocks with cool riffs , they have tunes up the wazzoo with heavenly hooks , harmonies to die for , the works ... and Cassee is really a good songwriter ... I think she 's just getting started.Tracks # 1 + 2 , `` Wish You Were Here '' & `` Wondergirl '' are my favorite tunes here ... but the Butch-produced , played-on and co-written `` Hangover '' is almost as worthy . I would keep an eye on Cassadee 's progress as a songwriter ... she 's got the goods ... a kickass mix of great melody , hooks , soul and deep lyrical honesty ... she wears her heart on her sleeve even if it bleeds . On `` Hold On Tight '' , 2 songs that really showed this mix well were `` Candles '' and `` Hurricane Streets '' , which came from experience , as they are from West Palm Beach , Florida , and get hit with hurricanes on a regular basis.Hey Monday , one of the best bands out today and this new EP is great and inexpensive ...

Korn III : Remember Who You Are is really a disappointed in an album from Korn , it reminds me alot of their 2003 album `` Take A Look In The Mirror '' which featured the original lineup before Brian `` Head '' Welch and David Salvia left the band . I will give Munky , Fieldy , Jonathan Davis , and Ray Luzier create for trying make the sound of the earlier albums along with Ross Robinson returning to produce the album after being gone since the bands Life is Peachy album which is the last album he produced with the band . It is no way a return to the earlier sound of Korn though in a few tracks you can hear a few nods to Korn 's earlier albums . I think alot of songs could use more work in them as I came away kinds not impressed with the album . I am not a huge fan of Korn by the way kinda of a follower of Korn but not a die hard fan . Issues got me into them and I avoided their recent albums Untitled and See You On The Other Side after Brian left the band . I really think the band should continue if that what makes them happy though most will say that the band is done with . They really could build on the sound of Korn for the next album if they chose to . Not a bad album by any means just not what die hard fans would want in a Korn album . If you want the older sound then listen to Issues , Life is Peachy , Korn , etc . Or listen to Heads album Save Me From Myself if you want the missing sound of Korn . Also Jonathan 's whinny sound needs to stop , i know its what fans love but its way overdone and Korn should probably go in a different direction . It was great 15 years and I understand is but fans love about Korn but I really do n't need it now when the guys are in their 40 's with families and really successful in life ."}, "22410": {"id": "22409", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I know I 'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin , please note that I really wanted to like this album , and I 'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III . For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you.I 'm not going to review each track , because once you 've heard the first few you 'll get the idea . Ever since 'Untouchables ' , there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of Korn albums , and for those of you who think I 'm dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of Head , both 'Untouchables ' and 'Take a Look in the Mirror ' featured Head as the lead guitar . 'Untouchables ' was a good album , not great . 'Mirror ' was still decent , and I 'll admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both 'See You on the Other Side ' and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album . However , a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album.I think its safe to say the the `` Korn sound '' was lost after 'Issues ' , and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album . When you listen to their early work , the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from `` Daddy '' on their debut album to `` Somebody Someone '' off of 'Issues . ' With the release of 'Untouchables ' , the Korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the 1950s . With each track , it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a 'catchy ' chorus . This is not to say the albums released since 2000 have been bad , they just are n't worthy of a 5-star rating.This new release sounds closer to `` Mirror '' than the last two , but it lacks the creativity that really separated Korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio waves . Does Jon Davis sound angrier on this album than the last two ? Yes . Does he growl more ? Sure . Are the lyrics memorable . No . Does the music stand out ? Not really . I sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because I 've been starved for new material , but lately I 've been taking the time to really listen before I judge , and I ask myself if I 'll feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road . In 6 months , listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and they 'll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the CD or turned it on via an MP3 player . They 'll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just is n't that great.I do n't want to rip the band because they 're still one of my favorites , but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression . Either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul .

With all the great Blues coming out today how does a native New Yorker with no Blues foundation represented ( ever ) in her music , and puts out maybe 1 record every 5-6 years score a # 1 ranked Blues record ? I recall a few years back Robert Palmer ( `` addicted to Love '' ) making a Blues record ( `` Drive '' ) that was `` heralded '' by critics and fans alike ... soon after he had a heart attack and died . I 'm not wishing that same fate on Cyndi , but to Those who assume they know the Blues should check out the Delmark and Living Blues websites to fully understand the Blues , then hopefully spend some cash purchasing a `` real '' Blues disc from a `` working '' Blues artist/band ...

They screamed against capitalism but set up shop on Sunset Blvd and wrote music for commercials and movies . Sold their song to a floor cleaner commercial . Jerry once made fun of people `` sitting around drinking Bud '' but let their song be sold for a beer commercial .

The first few lines of the opening title track of new album `` Teenage Dream '' are proof enough before considering the cotton candy nudity of the cover art . She has also clearly worked hard to maintain her career in the competitive couple of years since she released her debut in pre-Gaga 2008.Still , `` Teenage Dream '' is a slave to the unfortunate era in which it was created and equally unfortunate ( uninformed ) audience it was designed for.If a more sophisticated CD is a fancy dinner in a French restaurant , `` Teenage Dream '' is Coca-Cola to be lapped up by the masses - from Beijing to Burbank.Pop radio is by now little more than gimmicky ads and faceless tunes crafted by `` professionals '' that replace melodies with repetitive beats and last just long enough before the average listener 's attention span runs its course . The ads sound like songs and the songs sound like ads . `` Teenage Dream '' is designed to toss off hits deep into 2011 , and it surely will . The problem is that a product designed to appeal to the largest possible audience can only be as good as the average individual 's taste in that audience.This is not music concerned with strong , lasting pop melodies or well-written lyrics , although they occasionally arise on the likes of `` Circle the Drain '' ( a goodbye to a drug abuser with a painfully forced F-bomb for lame shock value ) and `` Who Am I Living For , '' which finds Perry 's voice painfully off-pitch , forced beyond its limits . `` Pearl '' is more exemplary , designed to exploit the average teenage girl 's insecurities with its recycled message of empowerment . Mediocrity is the name of the game.This is a batch of tunes crafted to make money in 2010 by cashing in on the taste buds of an audience that , as of this writing , watches `` Keeping Up with the Kardashians '' and `` Jersey Shore '' and , as it will with these tunes , have forgotten them with the passing of a year or two.Take these lyrics from `` Last Friday Night ( TGIF ) , '' sure to be a major hit : '' Pink flamingos in the pool/I smell like a minibar/DJ 's passed out in the yard/Barbie 's on the barbeque/There 's a hickie or a bruise/Pictures of last night/Ended up online/I 'm screwed , oh well . `` Perry shows ambition .

Results are what matter , and they show that Perry crafts two kinds of songs - sexaholic drivel designed to be hits for the non-thinking general public and decidedly more serious tunes that not only reveal the unflattering limits of her actual talent but that come off hopelessly forced and insincere.In the 80s , when pure pop painted itself all over mainstream radio , kids were exposed to Michael Jackson , Prince and Gloria Estefan , artists who crafted state-of-the-art hits that were well-sung , well-produced and had melodies .

Most of the arrangements have so many pop elements that they really are n't that different from the original songs . There was nothing that distinguished them enough from the originals to make me care about them . They have the same pop beats and follow the same progression and tempo , and the orchestra plays almost the same music that Sting 's musicians played on the original recordings . ( A clarinetist on `` Englishman in New York '' was assigned the dull task of recreating Branford Marsalis ' playing almost note for note . *Yaaawn . * ) Overall the arrangements lack originality and do n't present a unique take on Sting 's songs , as was done with Peter Gabriel 's on `` New Blood . `` There are four exceptions : Roxanne , I Burn For You , Black Seam , and The Pirate 's Bride . Roxanne and Pirate 's Bride in particular are hauntingly beautiful . ( Though I can imagine many Police fans rolling their eyes at a symphonic version of Roxanne ! ) And as much as I love Sting 's voice , I think an instrumental take on the better known songs would have been a worthwhile creative endeavor by these orchestras . It would have distinguished them further from the originals and allowed the melodies to shine apart from the lyrics.The other things that disappointed me about this CD was the song selection . It 's mostly `` B-side '' songs .

This project with a symphony orchestra is always tricky and my hunch that it will be not very interesting with old stuff polished into a violin setting is confirmed.No surprises in the arrangements and why not try completely new compositons instead of roxanne for the 50th time ?

I would like to get my hands on all of the demos because , like many other reviewers here , I agree that much of her material suffered from over-production . That sad mournful voice accompanied only by piano or acoustic guitar is the best way to hear Sandy Denny.I 'll stick with `` Boxful of Treasures '' , her Fairport , Strawbs , Fotheringay and solo records ( before and after Fairport ) and skip this overpriced , overlapping monstrosity . If the producer of this box would be kind enough to release the other `` unreleased '' demos as a standalone set , I 'd be more than happy to purchase it -- -- even at a premium price . But this set is , sorry , ridiculous ."}, "22478": {"id": "22477", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Apparently , this band went in that route that bands sometimes take in which they want to experiment and what comes out is not a great album , this ... is that type of album.I own every album of theirs and this to me is their worst album .

Good bye , Finger Eleven , you sold out ."}, "22480": {"id": "22479", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Bret Michaels seems to be everywhere lately . The Poison front man and solo artist has done 3 seasons of Rock of Love for television , appeared on The Apprentice and a few other tv shows , received publicity for the song `` Nothing To Lose '' which featured Miley Cyrus and was in the hospital not too long ago . But to be honest I was always more of a fan of the music he did with and outside of Poison than I am of his newfound celebrity status . I liked the material Bret released with Poison , especially the first few albums , and to some extend his solo career . Custom Built is Bret ` s fifth studio solo album , sixth if you count 2008 ` s Rock My World which had only 3 new songs and was mostly a greatest hits of his solo career up to that point and a promotional tool for his Rock of Love series.I think the material here is supposed to appeal to fans of the Rock of Love series or just Bret Michaels who don ` t know anything about his past music . A duet with Miley Cyrus was sure to bring Bret some attention on radio and bring him new fans who weren ` t familiar with him . I don ` t mean the material on the album is bad but this is almost the same thing Rock My World was , old songs with a few new thrown in and remixes . There are 12 songs on Custom Built of which 7 are new songs , there are two bonus songs included with the digital download only ( other versions of new songs Lie To Me and Wasted Time ) . Out of those seven songs there ` s the song for his new tv show Riding Against The Wind ( which is a very good song , I ` ll give him that ) Nothing To Lose with Miley Cyrus ( which depending how you view it might be good or absolute trash ) plus a solo version of the same song . There ` s also a cover song `` What I Got '' , another version of Every Rose Has It ` s Thorn ( I don ` t like this version , I thought it was such a personal song that including all those musicians kind of ruined it for me in the end ) and two new songs Lie To Me and Wasted Time which are good . Bret stays with the country-rock formula that he has stuck with his entire solo career , for the most part it ` s a pleasant sound and it works for him.So here ` s a summary of what Bret did on Custom Built : -Two new mixes of Driven ( that song has been on Freedom of Sound , Rock My World , Acoustic sessions and now on Custom Built ) and Go That Far . The mixes are not bad but the songs are not new.-Two versions of a new song Nothing To Lose.-His new television show ` s theme song.-Two other new songs ( total of five `` brand new '' songs ) -A new version of Every Rose Has It ` s Thorn with other artists.-A cover song.-Two Songs from `` Freedom of Sound '' .-One song from `` A Letter From Death Row '' .Correct me if I ` m wrong but there doesn ` t seem to be a whole lot of new on Custom Built . What ` s on the album is definitely not bad but I ` d prefer all-new material especially considering how Rock My World had only three new songs . If you just want the new songs go ahead but otherwise you will probably be deceved.I think the two new mixes are not bad , but rather unnecessary . Plus doing a new version of Every Rose Has Its Thorn seems useless as well if it ` s not going to be that great . I don ` t think Michaels will really impress anyone here but his new material is true to himself which is not a bad thing . As much as I love Bret as a musicians I ` d recommend this to casual fans and collectors only . I can ` t give this more than two stars unfortunately ."}, "22481": {"id": "22480", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I am currently listening to this NEWEST by Fantasia .

It started with 2005 dreary sounding Wildflower release , than even worse 2008 Detour , and now the worst yet 100 Miles From Memphis . She just seems to have lost all ability to write a catchy song and the Southern soul music that Crow loved as a kid just doesnt stir me at all . Drenched in full-bodied brass sections and stirring B3 organ runs , her voice fails to reach the full range of the songs she sings especially on Stop . Sheryl Crow is a great talent , has a great voice , and also she is gorgeous ( I love the cover of the album ) . But her material is just greatly lacking , she needs better songs and better production on her albums ! Some of ther songs are upbeat but they arent catchy and there are still plenty of dreary sounding tunes like her previous 2 albums . It 's all lackluster . This CD is enjoying some pretty good internet sales and on Amazon right now . But going by the poor reviews and even low customer reviews , this CD will burn out fast !

Then it was used again in Batman Begins in a more darker , mysterious and subtle approach . Then , The Dark Knight introduced that same two-note motif in it 's most aggressive performance ever . Now , for Inception , well , it 's epic again ... or is it ? After four soundtracks released with this Two-Note motif approach , you start to wonder if Zimmer is really trying to convince himself that he is still doing something different and creative . As a listener , and a fan of Hans Zimmer , you really feel that this is not different or epic at all , like when it was first heard . In my personal opinion , I find it to be a complete lack of effort from this composer , and it worries me . If you listen to Hans Zimmer 's compositions , apart from these two-note motif inspirations , you will find an array of beautifull unique compositions that do not resemble each other ( The Lion King , Spirit , Gladiator , Pearl Harbor , Tears of the Sun , King Arthur , POTC : At World 's End , The Holiday ) and still convey a sense of grandeur and emotion . Even The Da Vinci Code used a bit of this two-note motif prolongation in the masterpiece song Chevaliers de Sangreal . So ... until when are we still gon na be amazed by a two-note prolongation ? I really ca n't say I wan na buy this soundtrack because it 's yet another variation on the two-note motif heard already in The Last Samurai , Batman Begins , The Da Vinci Code and The Dark Knight . Since I already have all of these soundtracks , I 'm really not interested in hearing it again.What started out as a good and innovative idea has become , ironically , an excuse for staying in the same comfort zone that worked so well , initially , for The Last Samurai . It 's no longer creative nor innovative , it 's the contrary : a complete lack of creative thought in the composition process and a very predictable outcome ."}, "22487": {"id": "22486", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I 'm hoping eventually A7X will achieve a solid album start to finish . As of yet , the whole does not equal the sum of their individual parts . They 've got a good vocalist ( for the genre ) and an awesome guitarist . But this latest offering feels lazy and uninspired . They can do better ."}, "22488": {"id": "22487", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "First off , if you know you will disagree with my review and call me too `` shallow '' , or , more politically correctly put , ca n't accept me having a different opinion than you , stop reading this review right now . You wo n't change my mind , and I would n't even try changing yours . Anyways.Yes , the death of an amazing drummer was shocking to me . I kinda knew about his drug addiction but honestly never thought it would be to the point where the Rev would die . That said , when I pondered A7X 's future , I was unsure if they 'd be a band anymore , but like any band should , they will carry on . Jimmy would be pissed at them for just quitting because of his death . So rest assured , hopefully we 'll get more albums from Avenged.That said , Nightmare is a disappointment . After 5 spins of this album , I can honestly say I do n't like it . I was expecting this though , since their self titled was a disappointment . A flip through the songs will show that most of the songs sound the same and Shads sounds so boring here . Seriously , first time I heard the album , I thought `` WOW , he 's going through the motions . Like he 's reading the lyrics off a paper . `` Nightmare is an ugly pop song . It reeks so much of `` song written by mainstream success '' and `` rehash '' it is n't even funny . The lyrics are awful and childish . I hate how Shads keeps yelling about `` You '' , or `` your nightmare '' , or how `` You should have known the price of evil '' . Plus , there are are some UGLY inflections in Shads ' singing , right from the end of each line in verse one : BELOW ! ! ! ! ! ! SHOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! FOREVER ! ! ! ! ! ! MIND ! ! ! ! ! ! SIDE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . The midsection confirms that they have now turned into what I call `` Ed Hardy Wearing Douche Bag Rock '' . And then of course , the insertion of the piano which is a total rehash of a previous song , `` Tension '' . My poor ears ! ! ! Welcome To The Family is a decent song . Liked the verse but the chorus was boring.Danger Line is an awesome song musically but we 're getting a WWII message . And if I wan na be lectured about WWII , I 'll dig up one of my history books.Buried Alive is the reason people call A7X emo garbage . While I disagree with the often repeated stereotype , this song is showing A7X are quickly becoming what their detractors have called them from the beginning . Boring music and sucky lyrics , although the solo from Syn is cool.Natural Born Killer is easily the best tune on the album . I love the hardcore , all out feel . It just makes me want to headbang and it 's a perfect reminder of their old days . Problem with it though is that it seems really out of place , sequence wise , as it sounds like it should be placed later in the album.So Far Away is a decent ballad . Shads sounds emotional and painful , the music is some of A7X 's best ever and the lyrics are heartbreaking . However , a big problem with this album , and especially with this track , is that they 're losing their metal edge , and are now just becoming straightforward rock . Which brings me to the next song.God Hates Us is probably the second of the three only good songs on the album . The intro can fool you . It certainly did for me , then SUDDENLY IT EXPLODES , and just beats you while you 're down . Why not a whole album like this song ? Victim begins with church bells and a chorus , and it 's clear that A7X is throwing sound at us again , like the tribal drum beat on Brompton Cocktail . I listen to a Bruce Dickinson song ( Man of Sorrows ) that has a chorus in the opening and I feel like it 's there for a reason . The lyrics are touching , but they deserve better music . Why is half the album boring ballads ? This is seriously the most bipolar album I 've ever heard , and not in a good way.Tonight The World Dies . It 's an OK song but put it on City of Evil and I would have hit the `` skip '' button.Fiction is really interesting to me . The gothic piano is intoxicating . The lyrics are very sad- it seems like The Rev knew he was going to die , telling us he wanted us to be OK without him . This was a demo called `` Death '' , which was given to the band 3 days before his death . I broke down crying the first time I heard it . The best thing about it is Jimmy 's vocals . The worst thing about it is the fact that the best thing about it is Jimmy 's vocals . If not for his vocals , in fact if M. Shadows had sung on it , it 'd be the weak track it is . It kind of seems as if it does n't have a good ground to stand on , like you know there SHOULD be more . It 's a cool track that at the same time is a very weak track.Save Me is the final TRULY good track . An epic , it 's basically the band trying to get out of the nightmare . It has a frantic feel to it , the music is just outstanding , and it 's in the same vein as The Wicked End.I 've said enough things about the songs , but I ca n't say anything about the actual ALBUM as a whole . I ca n't just listen to a single track . An album is like a classical music symphony- sure listening to a song/movement is fun , but it defeats the purpose of a body of work as a whole . I guess you can say this is a good collection of songs , but as an album , it fails miserably . Every track feels out of place with the one before it . I listen to City of Evil , and I feel like I 'm on a fun heavy metal roller coaster ride . I listen to this and I feel like I 'm on an elevator to the top floor of an office building.As for Portnoy , he 's a great drummer and he does good here . Jimmy would be proud , knowing his favorite drummer is filling in for him . However , a dead drummer does n't make this album magically better , and for that , this album simply fails ."}, "22489": {"id": "22488", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "the girl is a really `` virtuosa '' one , but drives me crazy with her shouts , Sorry about it , is just my opinion ."}, "22490": {"id": "22489", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "There is no doubt Esperanza is talented and beautiful but she suffers from self-indulgence and repetitious scat singing which I 've never liked .

Simply put , there is a lack of intensity in some of these performances and that 's stunning given the names on the cd.Perhaps I 'm just a purist and hard to please and one day twenty years from now this collection will be regarded as a classic . Anything 's possible . I 've always said that I grew up during a time when we had the best music in the world .

Because if there has been a bigger fan of Elton John 's than me , I do n't know who it is . Listening to his piano-playing taught me how to play piano , and studying his songwriting taught me how to be a professional jingle writer . I have owned many of his albums on vinyl , cassette , CD , and remastered CD -- including so-called duds like `` A Single Man '' ( which I cherish for `` Shine On Through '' and `` Georgia '' ) . I can quote lyrics from all the album cuts from any album he made through the late '80s , and enjoyed many of his hits after that as well . I thought `` Songs From The West Coast '' was brilliant and long overdue , and `` Peachtree Road '' -- especially the version with cuts from `` Billy Elliot '' -- quite a decent effort . I even thought `` The Captain And The Kid '' had some moments -- not many , but a few -- with `` The Bridge '' being the high point for me.This album , this Elton John , is a pale and sadly pathetic imitation of himself.Now he 's reusing chord progressions and melodic 'hooks ' from his second-rate songs of the last five years . His torch-singer vocals are so stylized and forced they 're cloying to listen to . Perhaps eeriest of all , Taupin 's lyrics , usually poetic and thought-provoking , are banal at best , and the production seems not to notice.Let me give you an example you can hear for yourself , before you spent the $ 12.99 or the $ 7.99 for mp3s : a simple vocal doubling test . Off the top of my head , here are some EJ songs which use vocal overdubs to great effect : in `` Someone Saved My Life Tonight , '' Elton sings , `` And it 's one more beer and I do n't hear you '' and he overdubs himself on `` anymore . '' Brilliant , well-placed , moving and affecting . In `` Border Song , '' the doubling ( a choir effect ) is on the lyric `` holy moses , '' and you can hear the passion from the storyteller 's point of view . In `` Ticking , '' the doubling is on `` throw out your gun , walk out slow , '' and it makes sense because it 's the policemen talking to the gunman.Now click on track # 8 's sample.The overdub harmony is on the lyrics `` cayenne pepper '' in the line `` ... sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl . `` Please , if you do n't believe me , listen for yourself . If you 're moved , touched , or inspired by the accenting of the phrase `` cayenne pepper , '' buy this album immediately . But if you are n't , really take an honest look here . To paraphrase the first track off the aforementioned `` Songs From The West Coast , '' the emperor -- and EJ is truly an emperor of great music -- has no clothes . And unfortunately , I ca n't lie about it , or deny it , anymore . Ever since `` West Coast , '' each succeeding album has had successively less originality , less passion , less ... Elton-ness . Time used to be when almost every track came from a place of genius . This train do n't stop there anymore.Why ? I do n't know . I have no idea what happened to my musical hero . The only reasonable explanation is either age , or disconnection from the creative wellspring which got him to where he is ( whatever that might be ) . I believed that with `` West Coast '' Mr. John had decided to make great albums again , and I was very excited for the future . But looking back , I now think that might have been one last gasp at greatness . And he had what seemed an unlimited supply of greatness , so it 's a shocking thought to have . But based on the evidence -- the work since -- it seems likely he dug down deep for genius one last time ... and that 's all he had left in him.Believe me , it pains me to write this.Save your money . Write me and I will send you a LONG list of Elton John albums you should buy instead of this one . Have no doubt that I am an Elton John fan : truth is , the word 'fan ' does n't describe the deep effect the man and his work has had on my life . But I am a realistic human being . Many of his albums are among the best pop/rock recordings ever made . But based on this release , his new songs are no longer worthy of purchase.P.S . I 'm an admirer of Mr. Russell , particularly older greats like `` Manhattan Island Serenade , '' Lady Blue '' and of course `` A Song For You . '' Russell has managed to keep his edge , and apparently his connection to his source , so he comes off much better than Mr. John on this album , but it 's not nearly enough to make this album worthwhile in this man 's opinion ."}, "22538": {"id": "22537", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "As a huge Paula Cole fan , I buy everything she releases .

After seeing them live in 2007 , and picking up all of their other albums , I was eagerly anticipating the launch of A Thousand Suns . I waited awhile to pick it up , and after hearing all of the negative reviews , I decided to pick it up to see for myself . What you get here from LP , is a good , heartfelt effort , but one that ultimately leaves long time fans of their music , feeling angry and disappointed . If you want the gist of what my conclusion is , Do n't buy this album unless you want to experience how bad it is for yourself . Now , allow me to go a little more in depth.ATS opens up with , `` The Requiem '' , which is an alright instrumental intro into the album . The track however , is two minutes long , and loses your attention quickly . Hybrid Theory opened up with the fast paced `` Papercut '' . Meteora opened up with the 13 second long , `` Forward '' that gave way to the hit , `` Do n't Stay . '' Minutes to Midnight began with `` Wake '' , and following in those footsteps , ATS begins with an instrumental that is too long , and leaves you wishing the next track would hurry up . That next track is , `` The Radiance '' , which is a vocal track that serves as filler in an attempt to give you that `` epic '' feeling going into the actual music that we have now waited almost 3 minutes for through the first two tracks . This vocal track is n't necessary , ready for the music to actually begin ? Sigh . Here we go . `` Burning in the Skies '' is our first taste of actual LP music in the album .

After a few listens , I began to grow sick of hearing Chester whine , and feel bad for himself . As much as I love his voice usually , his whiny tone , coupled with the uninspired BG music , made me want to scream . I began to skip this song after my first listen through . Next ? Who would have thought we would have another vocal track ? If you can even call `` Empty Spaces '' a vocal track . What you get with `` track '' 4 , is a clone of Metallica 's beginning of `` One . '' Some military inspired track that features soldiers yelling and guns firing . If you do n't mind listening to 18 seconds of filler , listen to this , and get ready to laugh . On to track five . `` When They Come for Me '' literally envoked laughter on my end the first time I listened to it . This song ultimately serves as an attempt from LP to try to get back to their hard rock roots . The end result however , ends up being a laughable fusion of Mike rapping , and strange background music . The song opens up with some strange sounds , and an annoying ticking noise . The lyrics here are so terribly elementary , that it is a little funny . It almost feels like a Weird Al cover of a LP song . `` I am not a robot , I am not a monkey , I will not dance even if the beat 's funky , opposite of lazy , far from a punk , ya 'll better start talking , start tryna catch up , motha ****** . '' Is an example of an attempt to sound hardcore here in this song . What ends up happening , is Mike sounding like a disgruntled gang member that got kicked out of his clan because he was caught watching Dora the Explorer alone one day . Chester had his chance to play fool earlier , now it 's Mike 's turn . This song falls flat on it 's face , and features nothing audibly pleasing . Ready for some `` Robot Boy ? '' Me neither . `` Robot Boy '' is probably the sadest song on ATS . No no , not sad in the sense that it envokes emotion or tears . Sad in the sense that you 'll be thinking , `` Why did I pay for this ? '' `` What happened to LP ? '' Robot boy is the most uninspired song on the album , and features Chester whining again . With a piano track that sounds like something from Elton John 's greatest hits , Chester begins to croon on about how there 's no one to give love to , I cringed when I first heard this song . A radio friendly ballad that almost crosses into the range of R & B ; , not for me . Fans of Ne-Yo may eat this song up , but it 's far too long for it 's own good at 4:28 , and deserves to be skipped over . Hey , does n't it feel like time for another sweet vocal track ? I think so . `` Jornada Del Muetro '' is another minute plus of useless filler . I think I heard somewhere that it 's the words from the first track in Spanish . Either way , I el skippo this one every time since my first listen . `` Waiting for the End '' was the first song that I truly enjoyed on this album . Pretty sad , that on track eight of fifteen , you finally find a listenable song . `` Waiting for the End '' is radio friendly , but finds a way to sound good since it correctly blends Chester and Mike together for the first time on the album . The music is decent , and the lyrics finally do n't sound like they were written in grade school . This got lots of radio time before the album 's release , so many are familiar with this one . Give it a listen , if you 're an I-tunes user , buy this one . It could pass for an unreleased song off MTM.Now on to what is my personal favorite song on the album . `` Blackout '' shows that LP is still capable of making good tunes- That they have n't completely lost themselves . This song features interesting musical work , followed by Chester coming in with `` Im stuck in this bed you 've made.. '' to be followed by him screaming , for the first time on the album . LP tries something new for the first time on the album here as well . At about 2 minutes in , prepare yourself for a cool little breakdown . The guitar is altered , to be followed by Chester 's voice being manipulated in what sounds very cool . This part of the song had me moving my head for the first time of the album , as I tapped along to the the cool sounds . Chester sings again , and the song comes to a close . This tune is good too , pick it up if you buy online . `` Wretches and Kings '' comes next . The song opens up with a clip of Mario Savio 's famous rant in the 1960 's about passively taking part in the operation of the machine . This song is `` meh . '' Inserting Mario 's quotes actually utilizes sound clips in a way that makes sense for the first time on ATS . It 's an alright song , you may wish to buy it seperately . It has a nice , fun feel at times , I declare this song passable for the third straight good track . `` Wisdom , Justice , and Love '' is a vocal track , of a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. His voice is warped as the track fades out . As great of a man as MLK was , the track seems to have no place , or purpose . Listen to it once , and skip it every listen after- it 's historically important filler.Now that they 've guilt tripped me with a quote from the great MLK , trying to make me feel bad about hating the rest of the album , I will continue . `` Iridescent '' is nothing new . More radio friendly garbage from Chester , with softly played guitar , Chester playing his new role of , `` Poor pitiful me , stop the violence and down with the hate , do you like my self loathing and whiny auto tuned vocal tracks ? '' Listen to `` Iridescent '' once , and never come back.With a few tracks remaining in the album , we get another vocal track to ease us into the final couple of songs . Hooray . We get another altered version of some of the lyrics we 've already heard . Out of all the vocal tracks on the album so far , this one may be the most useless yet . More filler , that simply features another part of the album , slowed down by about 75 percent . This garbage goes on for nearly 1:30 , which is way too long for something that could have been put into the front end of another song . Do n't even bother listening to this once , unless you 're trying to kill time . Skip it , and prepare for `` The Catalyst '' , which you 've probably already heard . `` The Catalyst '' was one of the bigger songs leading up to the album 's release . After gaining fame on Youtube , the song is placed at the very back end of the album at track 14 . Not what I would have done if I were producing it . Personally , I do n't see the thrill in this song . While it is better than the musical compost found on the beginning of the album , it 's nothing you have n't heard before . This tune sounds more like something that would be on in a night club in the center of your nearest big city . Alcohol influenced youths would probably get up and dance to this one in a nightclub , which is not what LP is supposed to be known for . The agony goes on for over five minutes . Some like this track , but I am not one . While it 's passable , and not nearly as bad as say , `` Robot Boy '' , I have come to hate it after my first full listen through.Alright , the final song . Will it be epic ? The song we 've been waiting for ? Nope . Just , `` The Messenger '' . Chester steals the show again , and bombs it to close out the album . Chester continues to whine , and soak your ears in self loathing . By this point , if you were n't wearing make-up and tight jeans , with an attitude that everyone is out to get you , you are now . Chester 's attempt to convert you into an emotional wreck that thinks your life is a big conspiracy , ends with this.. erm.. accoustic ? .. track.. `` Love leaves us blind . '' `` Love keeps us kind '' No , those are not quotes from Kelly Clarkson , they are lines from this song . Close the book on the album with a bitter taste in your mouth , and anger in your ears.While I ca n't justify giving this album 1 star , I will reluctanly give it 2 . The album saves itself from ultimate failure with a few good songs . `` Blackout '' , `` Waiting for the End '' , and perhaps `` Wretches and Kings '' will give true LP fans a little something to listen to . While the new wave of `` fans '' who eat this album up , singing Chester 's ballads in the shower , will tell you otherwise , turn the other way . This album is nothing more than LP giving the finger to their true fans . If you do n't believe me , give Meteora a listen . Heck , give Hyrbrid Theory a listen . LP 's debut , Hybrid Theory , was good . Their sophomore , Meteora was fantastic , one of my favorite albums of all time . Minutes to Midnight was passable , but this , this is just unacceptable.While this review will get thumbed down by fanboys , and mainstream listeners who heard `` The Catalyst '' on youtube , or `` Waiting for the End '' on the radio , and declared LP their new favorite band , those of us who know the true nature of LP will see the truth . This is musical garbage , do n't even touch it unless you feel like you need to own the beginning of the end of LP . Unless the band turns it around in their next release , LP is dead . Fed to the dogs that are MTV and Billboard Top 100 Charts . You had a good run LP , rest in peace . For true fans , the first two albums are still there to be enjoyed . Perhaps we see the band clean up their act over the next couple of years , but this album offers little hope towards that ."}, "22558": {"id": "22557", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I was n't going to fall into another LP trap , and buy this while ignoring the bad reviews .

'' A Thousand Suns '' is nearly a complete departure from everything that made Linkin Park famous .

This album is only half songs ... the other half is intros/outros . When I buy an album , I buy it to listen to music , not robotic voices or strange sound effects . It 's as if they tried too hard to come up with something different , and they nearly failed on the part where they 're supposed make good rock music ( save `` The Catalyst '' ) .This is what the band says about `` A Thousand Suns '' : '' We were not making an album . For months , we 'd been destroying and rebuilding our band . The experiments that resulted filled the studio hard drive with diverse , abstract sounds . Amorphous echoes , cacophonous samples , and handmade staccato merged into wandering , elusive melody . Each track felt like a hallucination . We did n't know if any of those unorthodox ideas could be incorporated into a traditional album , but we knew we did n't want our next album to be predictable ... We asked ourselves : were we all earnestly willing , more than ever before , to abandon the precepts of commercial ambition in pursuit of what we believe to be honest art ? `` To their credit , Linkin Park accomplished some of what they set out to do . They created an album which is very unpredictable and chock-full of `` unorthodox ideas '' . The band calls this album `` honest art '' and some people call these changes evolution , but with all the changes , Linkin Park has distanced itself from a large portion of its fan base , myself included . It appears that Linkin Park has reached so high , they 've lost their footing . If this is honest art , it 's almost too abstract and bizarre to enjoy.I bought this album on a whim , hoping to be pleasantly surprised , and I 'm sorry to say that I regret the purchase.The only songs I enjoyed on `` A Thousand Suns '' are `` The Catalyst '' and `` Waiting For The End '' .

Although Meteora from 2003 basically continued in that vein , Linkin Park had to sink or swim ; since 2001 Korn and Limp Bizkit have suffered massive loss in sales , and Linkin Park was going to follow them down that path if they did n't adapt . In 2007 they released 'Minutes to Midnight ' , which was a major departure from their earlier sound . It was more ambitious and diverse . It was essentially a completely different style . Obviously LP were well educated on the low opinion of them in this post-Nu-Metal world.They have followed this up with 'A Thousand suns ' , which is a kind of social-conscious album that is full of statements . To understand WHY I give this album a low-rating , it 's worth comparing to an album almost 20 years ago by a hair-metal band ; 'Three sides to every story ' by 'Extreme ' . 'Extreme ' were labelled a hair-metal band in a grunge world that suddenly did n't like their style . They came out in 1992 with an ambitious album full of social commentary , including anti-war anthems . What also makes the two albums worth comparing is because on that album 'Extreme ' used a sample from a speeach by social activist Martin Luther King . 'A thousand suns ' uses three excerpts from activists ' speeches , including one from the same Martin Luther King . However there is one clear difference between the two.While 'Three sides to every story ' is a very well-thought out album that has a lot of meaning , 'A thousand sons ' does n't really mean anything . The lyrics have a lot big statements and emotion filled passages of sanctimony , but the overall meaning is often vague to the point of having no meaning at all . There 's a lot of complaint and discontent , which has always been a feature of Linkin Park music , but now that they 've cloaked themselves in Rage Against the Machine like activism , it 's even more frustrating that the lyrics really do n't amount to anything . And the music itself is a step-back from 'Minutes to Midnight ' . Genuine good song-writing and complexity , who showed their heads occasionally on the last album , have been replaced by a lot of effects and sampling . There are some good vocal harmonies here and there but that ca n't save songs that are desperately trying to cover their own lack of substance . That said , the songs 'Catalyst ' and 'The Messenger ' are genuinely high quality , 'The Messenger ' is particularly lovely.Shame really , I have been intrigued by these recent Linkin Park albums , since I have discovered them recently , because I thought there might be a Nu-Metal band that can come good , but 'A thousand suns ' is basically a meticulously and thoroughly crafted piece of crap .

I love , love , LOVE Joshua Radin . His style is ( or was ) unique , his voice quiet and thoughtful , his lyrics emotional and deep . We Were Here was such a groundbreaking album for me . It is largely responsible for my being a fan of acoustic music . Winter , Star Mile , Closer ... These were classics that have been stuck in my head since the first time I 've heard them . Simple Times , though different , had some very high points , such as Sky , I 'd Rather Be With You , Brand New Day , Friend Like You , and so on . The Rock and the Tide , at least upon first listen , seems to be so far out of the range of what Mr. Radin is known for , what he does best , and what got him where he is , that it 's like he 's going in a direction I 'm not really willing to follow . He was once a subtle voice in a noisy world . Now he 's just part of the noise . I understand artists have to progress . I 'm a recording artist myself so I understand that all too well . But you ca n't go so far beyond where you came from that you ca n't see home anymore at all , and it feels like that 's where Joshua Radin is heading , as if the acoustic stuff he wrote was only out of necessity because he was n't big yet and could n't afford his own band and so he 'd settle for acoustic songs for now until he could do what he really wanted to do . I mean , there 's only like two songs were the acoustic guitar is the main instrument it seems like . There are no female vocals -- that 's part of his sound ! Where 's Priscilla Ahn ? Where 's Ingrid Michaelson ? Now , I 'll listen to this CD again and see if I think differently . It may just be that I 'm refusing to accept his new direction because I 'm too fettered to the old one . It happens . And sometimes , I 'll re-listen in a few weeks and go , `` Wow ! What was I thinking ? ! This is GREAT ! '' And sometimes I 'll listen and go , `` Yep . Still sucks . '' So , what will happen here ? I do n't know . But I will give it a chance . But my initial response , quite frankly , is disappointment.A note on the live DVD -- Okay , first of all the mix is way off . Thin acoustic guitars and massive pounding bass drums . I do n't know who mixed this or who the sound guy was , but someone fell asleep at the switch , as it were . Also , where are those favorites ? I mean , there were a few , but NOTHING from We Were Here . It 's a good thing the DVD came free with the CD because if I had spent money on it I would be jacked.To Joshua Radin , I would say this in summation : The acoustic guitar has been around for many a year , and no one 's tired of it yet . Yes , from complex finger-picking to simple chord strumming , countless people play the acoustic guitar and still sell CDs , get people to listen , and so on , and they do so because the songs they play are real , they 're organic , they 're human . Of course , rock n ' roll has been around for quite some time , too , and many people enjoy it 's loudness . Personally , I do n't think you do the loud stuff good enough to make your way in this world with rock n ' roll . You did , however , do the acoustic stuff with such passion , elegance , realness and humanity that you could 've made ten more albums building on what you started in your first major label release and would have made a name for yourself as the quintessential acoustic singer-songwriter . Now you 're just another guy sounding like the rest . So my advice , for what it 's worth to ya , is take a step back , regroup , and try again . You do n't have to put out We Were Here part 2 , but you do n't have to try to put out Born in the USA either . Springsteen already did that , and he did it better than you 'll ever do it ."}, "22589": {"id": "22588", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "At the time David Archuleta was a contestant on American Idol Season six , I was a huge fan and was hoping he would be the ultimate victor . Given another voting scandal ( despite David Cook 's consummate popularity ) , Archuleta lost heartily it seemed , despite easily out-singing Cook on finale night . I did n't purchase Archuleta 's first effort , though I did hear single `` Crush , '' but did n't find myself impressed by any means . Similarly on his second effort , I am not truly impressed with the material , finding Archuleta 's great vocal talents sometimes compromised because of lackadaisical , ill-fitting material . It is not a horrible affair , but bland to say the least . `` The Other Side of Down '' strikes a bad chord with me because its dance-pop production work would not be my first choice of production work or style supporting Archuleta . Archuleta sounds uninspired at times and the breeziness of this cut does not captivate me as a listener . `` Something ` Bout Love '' is slightly better , exhibiting Archuleta 's fine falsetto , but again , electro-centric based production work is not my first choice for a vocalist with the talents of Archuleta . Again , I do not feel a connection with this song , which makes this cut come over as generic . `` Elevator '' may be the albums first noteworthy cut , given Archuleta a better `` look '' as far as production work with guitars supporting him . Again , Archuleta 's falsetto is solid , even though the heaviness of the guitars cover him up during the refrain . This cut is corny , do not get me wrong , but it is much better than the big , electro-driven cuts and let 's face it - the hook is catchy ! ! ! `` Stomping Roses '' is ok , but the production grows ` overwrought ' and this cut feels like another rewrite of the same cut , which is another issue I have with The Other Side of Down . `` Who I Am '' finds Archuleta sounding good , though the gimmickry and repetition grows annoying . Again , there is no connection with the material between vocalist and song or for the listener . `` Falling Stars '' suits Archuleta better than most cuts , though it is by no means his ` saving grace ' on this oddly compiled effort . Finally through `` Parachutes Airplanes '' does Archuleta capture the spark that made millions of voters vote for the singer . It is not going to be the next big hit by any means , but `` Parachutes Airplanes '' is actually solid without much to quibble about . Just when some momentum was being mustered up , `` Look Around , '' a blatantly underachieving cut is interesting , but clunky in overall songwriting and conception . Again , gimmickry does in Archuleta rather than finding more interesting and inspired material to showcase the singer 's great talent . `` Good Place , '' `` Complain , '' and `` Things Are Gon na Get Better '' are authentic cuts from this rather inauthentic album . `` Good Place '' finds Archuleta supported by a traditional pop production scheme ; Archuleta 's vocals strengths are hence showcased . `` Complain '' features superb vocals by Archuleta and sound songwriting - again keeping in mind even the best cuts are by no means innovative or revolutionary . `` Things Are Gon na Get Better , '' is a moving and uplifting number , including a choir . The bridge section of this cut is particularly beautiful and noteworthy . Closing cut `` My Kind of Perfect '' may not be as good as `` Good Place , '' `` Complain , '' or `` Things Are Gon na Get Better , '' but it accentuates Archuleta 's vocal strengths well , better than the two clunkers that open up this album.I would love to say that I absolutely loved this album when listening to it , but alas , I just did not . With so many pop-tarts assimilating to every trend that further threatens to take away their personality and individuality as an artist , it is hard to get excited about anything . This is that album that further alienates Archuleta from commercial success because it does nothing to set him aside from other artists .

His album covers from this period make that evident . Unfortunately , donning a snazzy suit and singing chestnuts does not make one Tony Bennett any more than tossing on a leather jacket and ripped jeans makes one Joey Ramone or sporting a soulful swoon makes one Al Green.In the world of Rod Stewart image is consistently at the forefront , especially on this disc , where he sounds in perpetual need of a throat lozenge . While his voice has coolly mellowed , not every show biz veteran emanates nostalgic gold on cue.This music is as much about marketing and product-placement as the drivel being spilled out by acts such as Katy Perry or Ke $ ha , with little to no soul , substance or artistry behind it . The only difference is the demographic being aimed at - here , baby boomers with only a minimal amount of sophistication or taste ( if that ) who know this material is `` good for them '' but do not have the energy , drive or impetus to locate performances of these songs from better , more suitable vocal interpreters . `` Rod Stewart '' is therefore more a brand and familiar face in this context.The arrangements are textured and nicely orchestrated , and Stewart usually sounds like he is supplying differing emotions as he moves in and out of the tracks - and these are , after all , some of the best songs ever written . Even a minimum of competence as a singer can make the likes of `` What a Difference a Day Makes '' and `` I 've Got the World on a String '' sound fine.Stewart displays a minimum of enthusiasm for the material and his job as singer , so it all does sound `` fine '' - not transcendent , not brilliant , not particularly soulful , rich or stirring - in other words , not good enough.In an era where we , by some wonderful luck , still have Tony Bennett regularly touring and hitting the backs of concert halls , unmiked , with his rendition of Bart Howard 's `` Fly Me to the Moon , '' there is simply no need to hear Rod Stewart sleepwalk his way through it . It is redundant , reductive , excessive and unwholesome all at once , much like the experience of Michael Buble performing Sinatra bastardization in a predictable suit and tie . Mimicry is not art.Go to the nearest jazz hole in the wall you can find if music really matters to you . Order a cocktail and sit down .

Whether browsing the photographs throughout the CD booklet , watching the music video or listening to the music , it is clear that Perugino 's primary objective with this project was to make a record Frontiers could market in the North American music market by cloning Avril Lavigne . If female-fronted rock with cynical lyrics is your forte , this will be your album .

The raw feeling of the music with often mono guitar tracks and rough , heavily compressed drum tracks reminded me of early M & ouml ; tley Cr & uuml ; e , including the gratuitous motorcycle sound effects on `` Flying High .

I 'm seeing now that `` Guitars '' are n't `` in '' anymore , For female artists atleast . We do n't have many ( If any at all ) female rockers or female pop/rock that 's equivalent to their male counterparts . Is there a market for female modern-rock anymore ? ? ? , Im just not understanding.The stuff on this album is comparable to The Veronicas , Aly & AJ and even Tatu 's latest work . I like all three bands but as you can see That 's why I like `` THEM '' , Because that 's what `` THEY '' do . I do n't need Lillix to do what they 're doing . if that 's the case I can just listen to one of those three bands if I want to hear music like this . Huge mistake for Lillix , These girls definitely made a wrong turn.Lillix is not the band they once were when they first arrived . They 've changed drastically from a rock quartet to a pop/dance duo . This is not even the same band , Everything 's different . Is this even considered the same genre of music ? What happened to songs like `` Tomorrow '' `` Quicksand '' `` 24/7 '' `` Promise '' , Was it all just a fad ? , I thought that was a signiture sound for them . I feel as though the true colors are being shown , `` Falling Uphill '' was just a sound that was `` in '' . No offense but the best vocals IMO ( Miss Louise Burns ) has removed herself from the band . The only thing about Lillix that still exists is the name . Everything else is altered or thrown out . Which is probably why Britt Black escaped before this album was released because she knew this was n't going anywhere . I did n't realise the impact Louise had on the band.Tigerlily is comprised of synthesizers and polished dance-grooves , Great combination but not what I had in mind . Let 's get one thing straight . I 'm into dance music heavily , I love electronica , I also love the more polished and shallow side of pop music , I love all of it , But I already have a set list of what artists I listen to when I 'm in need of that particular sound . I became a fan of Lillix because of their own distinct sound . There 's not ANY female rock bands at the moment that are mainstream . They 're not out there , Which is one reason I `` was '' so fascinated and focused on this band . These girls get worse and worse each album . `` Inside The Hollow '' and now this.I 'll admit `` Back Up Girl '' & `` 7 Days '' have a familiar `` Falling Uphill sound '' , `` Say No More '' is something different for the band but still sounds true to what Lillix is all about . `` Dance Alone '' sounds like a rejected track from the last album , Which leaves me bitter when I hear it , I 've already reviewed the single ( Not so great ) . Everything else on this album is disposable manufactured shiny pop music.I truly believe that Lillix will not go far as a duo , It just does n't have the same effect as an all-girl band writing and singing alternative rock songs . There 's nothing special about a digital pop/dance duo , Especially today . It 's like ... What 's the point of duo named Lillix when they 're doing what all the other girls are doing . There 's really no point in their existance at this point , they 're just taking up space and making people angry . Just two basic girls with average music , How different is that ? , Do n't we have enough of those ? . So I guess all we do is wait and see what happens next . I bet this is it ."}, "22613": {"id": "22612", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "One of the best hard rock albums in recent years , no doubt , BUT in my opinion-buy it on CD or simply download it.For some reason vinyl sounds horrible.I was expecting quality of sound close to Music on Vinyl or may be recent DSD re-issues , especially looking forward to the sound of Bonamassa 's guitars and Hughes 's bass and voice.Nothing like this happened.Flat , colorless mixing reminded me of some bad monaural recordings from early 60 's .

The package is very well done , does n't feel cheap at all . Everything fits nicely together and the vinyl is in a separate side of the box set to the CD 's , DVD 's and booklets , as it should be . So ... where does it go wrong ? From the first notes of the first LP or CD you 're in for a big disappointment . Another release gets ruined with overzealous dynamic range compression.Now I was n't too concerned about how the CD 's were going to turn out , I got this first and foremost for the vinyl and secondly for the DVD of the videos . Due to low sales numbers and the methodology in which vinyl records are created , vinyl editions of recent albums have seen better mastering than their CD counterparts . Do n't get all defensive and launch into a CD vs. vinyl debate , because this is n't about that . What I 'm saying is , the vinyl releases of new albums from Alice in Chains , Dave Matthews Band and others have received less dynamic range compression and less tools that result in dimished dynamics of the master that is to be used to create the vinyl , resulting in a more dynamic performance , one closer to what the producer was hearing in the studio one would hope.This is n't the case with Telephantasm , the vinyl is as poorly mastered as the CD is , perhaps even worse . The sibilance does not hold up well in Cornell 's high notes and Cameron 's cymbals and hi-hat , it sizzles into obscurity . There is little in the way of dynamics , everything sounds like your typical 2010 CD . This is very disappointing given that there are supposed to only be 5,000 copies of this . The loudness war sucks wholeheartedly , but with top bands usually only moving between 12,000~25,000 copies of their records per year the vinyl usually escapes as the idiots in A & R ; at the labels and those musicians who do n't know any better usually do n't care about the vinyl , it 's not getting into enough people 's hands , therefore the mastering engineer can master with dynamics intact like most of them want to.I compared Outshined and Rusty Cage from SIDE THREE of the coloured vinyl with my 2003 German ( EU ) pressing of Badmotorfinger , man what a MASSIVE difference , the sonics and dynamics of the recording are wonderful on the 2003 edition , which can still be found on the Amazon Germany website , ASIN B000057UWZ.If you want to order one of the two copies left , just follow through the buttons , you do n't need to read German to navigate , it 's all the same set-up as Amazon Canada or US . I highly recommend this pressing at 24 Euros , even though you 'll have to pony up 14 Euros for shipping to North America it 's still worth it to get the best sounding version of Badmotorfinger I 've ever heard , although if you do n't spin vinyl be content with the original CD , it 's also very good.I was hoping with Bob Ludwig 's name attached that the CD 's might be okay , but should have know the label and project team probably said `` no , we need this to be loud like other bands albums are these days , or kids wo n't like it '' - which is TOTAL BLOODY NONSENSE . You can see a comparison between the Badmotorfinger CD and the Telephantasm CD in a post I made at the Steve Hoffman forums by googling `` Soundgarden outshined telephantasm vs badmotorfinger dynamic comparison '' and click on the first link that says `` New release sounds like crap '' and check out post # 20.The 2010 tracks are clearly boosted , well outside the scope of CD 's limits resulting in brickwalling and/or limiting to prevent a massive amount of clipping . Dynamics are suffering , what a shame . It 's nowhere near as bad as Death Magnetic , but it 's still poor.I will say that the CD actually sounds better than the vinyl to my ears , or maybe it 's just that the vinyl sounds so poor compared to the 2003 EU pressing of Badmotorfinger that I do n't even remember how bad the CD sounds.Now maybe there is one saving grace for this package ... the DVD . Nope , it suffers too . The audio is n't as bad as the CD and vinyl from a dynamic perspective , but the bitrate afforded the DVD 's audio track is poor . They 've gone with 2.0 Dolby Digital only at a bitrate of a little over 200 Kbps . No effort was made to visit the studio and create a 5.1 mix , they did n't even add a 2.0 PCM uncompressed stereo mix which would have been much more palatable . I 'd love it if they 'd included a Blu-ray of all the videos , but really the source material is probably video in most cases and the Blu-ray would only allow for less compression ... but a high resolution 24-bit audio track would n't have gone amiss . Anyway , that 's neither here nor there , it 's nice to see some of these videos and remember watching the Buzz Bin on MTV in 1991 seeing Outshined ... but the lack of fidelity in choosing only a Dolby 2.0 mix takes away from it . Had they used the full 448 Kbps allowed on DVD for Dolby it would have been a much more enjoyable sonic experience.Overall I can only give this collection 2 stars . It 's well put together and definitely great for collectors , but the sonic misadventures that afflict the DVD , the 3LP 's and the 2CD 's are just not welcome in my house , I 'm probably returning mine to Amazon ."}, "22620": {"id": "22619", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Very disappointed .

Going into the studio has become like a hobby for Neil and now you have those Neil heads that will go out and buy any CD he puts out . They all sell around 200,000 copies , the better albums slightly more . The same was true when Todd Rundgren was cranking out albums in the 80 's like crazy and Todd heads would buy 100,000 ( almost every album ) . Neil 's new album is not one of the better ones . His last several have not been the better ones . Le Noise is very short , only 9 songs just under 40 minutes . This was not the case with Prairie Wind or Chrome Dreams II which are his only two decent releases from the last decade . Unlike everyone saying here all his CDs are 40 minutes . The BAD recent albums have been yes , because he has very little to put out ( like I said it 's become a hobby of his ) . Oh sorry I forgot to mention Greendale which was almost 80 minutes and a GREAT CD by the way . See what I mean when Neil has good stuff , it 's substantial to the release . Le Noise is not well recorded either , the guitar is too loud and drowns out the rest of the music . Many of the songs are not very well written musically , just little experimental pieces . Neil has MUCH MUCH better albums than these , unless your a Neil head , pass on this one !"}, "22641": {"id": "22640", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I 've been a Dream Theater fan for around 20 years and I absolutely LOVE James ' voice , so I ordered this CD without even listening to the samples first .

Last spring rising hip hop artist B.O.B . had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B. , Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire . On the heels of a possible jail sentence , we now have Bruno Mars debut album . Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot.1 .

Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999 . * out of ****.5 . The Lazy Song - Listening to this track , I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc . Just as the title implies this is a lazy song . ** out of ****.6 . Marry You - I 'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence . *** out of ****7 . Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time . I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one.8 . Liquor Store Blues ( Feat . Damian Marley ) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it . *** out of ****.9 . Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be . If he does n't go to jail and with a great band backing him , this song will sound great live . ****10 . The Other Side ( Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o.B ) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it 's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing . *** out of ****Overall this is n't a horrible debut album , it is a mediocre album . I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R & B ; album with top notch production , instead he 's given us a Jason Marz sounding album . Bruno has a naturally smooth falsetto voice and while he could n't handle to other falsetto 's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant , the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps . Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he did n't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he 'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg 's ."}, "22645": {"id": "22644", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Only a few of his hits songs on this cd .

Arrangement wise , production wise , musically and lyrically , they are just a group of talented , intellegent songwriters who look at faith with a mixture of doubt and belief that is terribly interesting , and usually terribly creative.Now I am not going to say that their latest project , `` The Shelter '' , is terrible , because it 's not . The basic idea of the record , that of a worship record with an underlying theme of community , is not a bad one . And to go one even further they colloborated with a great list of people from the christian music world , such as former dc Talk man Toby Mac , Brandon Heath , Leigh Nash ( who also appeared on the excellent `` Mirrors and Smoke '' from Jars of Clay 's excellent `` Good Monsters '' record ) , and assorted others . On paper it looks like Jars of Clay would once again succede with a smart record that tweaked the conventions just enough to make it interesting.Well , sadly this time the group fails.As I have said previously , I am not of the religious sort , but a good song is a good song . Sadly most of these just are n't good songs . They lack compelling melodies , interesting production or affecting lyrics . The songs are mostly leaden , with the lyrics following a pretty easy , repetitive quality that might lead to good sing alongs in church , but outside of that community will probably not warrent more than a few passing listens.The one song that rises against the trent is the title track , where a comforting message , beautiful harmonies and a vaguely Peter Gabriel-ian vocal melody from Toby Mac ( which is interesting when you consider that his former bandmate Kevin Max has spent a large protion of his solo career miming the career of Gabriel , but whatever ) , add up to a truly memorable song , and easily one of their best songs.I give this record two stars because it 's not miserable , or terrible , but rather background noise . It exists , and will continue to do so , but I ca n't see many people going back to it more than a few times .

He had one small radio hit with `` O Lets Do It '' and I thought well that 's it . Then over the summer he came strong with `` Hard In The Paint '' . Still did n't know it was him . By time `` No Hands '' was everywhere on the radio , I did n't know if it was his single or Wale 's ( I hoped it was Wale 's track ) When I heard his album title was `` Flockaveli '' I thought `` Hell Nah '' . Who is this young cat with no lyrics using the great Tupac 's name to get more publicity ? So of course it made me even more skeptical.The first thing I noticed was how much the beats sound like Rick Ross 's B.M.F . Then I found out that this album was produced by young producer Lex Luger ( who also produced Ross 's B.M.F & MC Hammer ) . His work is very impressive . The hardcore , bass thumping beats on `` Bustin ' At ` Em '' & the summer street banger `` Hard In The Paint '' remind me of a young Lil ' Jon . His beats lay the perfect background , too bad Flame is a horrible lyricist . I have n't heard a rapper say his name so much in a song since Mike Jones . His rhymes are cartoonish . It does n't take a musical genius to rhyme `` Flame '' & `` Mane '' . ( You can see the huge lyrical gap between Flame and Wale on `` No Hands '' ) The song titles tell you everything you need to know about the song . `` G Check '' , `` Bang '' & `` Smoke , Drank '' , lets you know there is nothing intelligent being said in these songs.Not since Young Jeezy 's `` Thug Motivation 101 '' , has a true gangsta , hardcore rap album came out .

It 's back to the basics for Shakira : no Lil Wayne collaborations , no Timbaland-produced hip hop tracks and for the most part , no real breakout tracks to speak of . While I applaud Shakira for realizing that her quest to remain relevant in the U.S. was killing her music , I caution her for going to such an extreme as ` Sale El Sol ' feels . It 's a timid , safe , sleepy album . Missing from the album is that edgy , a times uninhibited and suggestive , fun Shakira that caught the world 's attention with `` Whatever , Whenever '' and she 's replaced with a rather sterilized version of that artist.The Good : What works best on 'Sale El Sol ' is that Shakira does n't seem to be concerned with making an album just for the U.S. as happened with 'She Wolf ' . Sure , she sings a few tracks in English but this album is really made for an international , non-English speaking world and that fact alone makes this musical effort a bit stronger than her last few outtings . 'Sale El Sol ' plays a lot with wordly sounds and genres of music - you have a lot of Spanish-influences , a little reggae-ton , a dash of hip-hop and a lot of rock . The tracks that work best are the ballads and down tempo tracks that are sung in complete Spanish . These are the tracks that feature Shakira at her best - sure , those who do n't speak or know Spanish may feel a bit loss in the lyrics but you are able to connect with her emotions and the sentiment that she exudes through her delivery of the lyrics . Those tracks include `` Antes de las Seis '' , `` Rabiosa '' , and `` Devoci & oacute ; n '' and to me are among the best tracks she 's done in a long while . Again , what I liked about 'Sale El Sol ' is that its target audience is n't as limited to the U.S. as 'She Wolf ' was and it has an encompassing feeling with its lyrics , genres of music and overall vibe.The Bad : There are things I really like about this album but a lot more that I 'm just not crazy about . I 'm actually glad Shakira attempted to ditch her efforts to break into , or stay relevant , in the United States . That being said , 'Sale El Sol ' feels somewhat timid and reserved . It feels like she 's responding to her declining successes in the U.S. with an album meant to remind the world of her better days but in doing so some of her edge , spontaneity , creativity and that sexual prowess that she tends to exude in her music was lost as well . A lot of the music on this album feels watered down , weak and forgettable . Usually there 's at least one or two tracks that stands out as being potential big hits but I really do n't see any of the tracks on this release doing much for her career . The album being mostly in Spanish , while a good creative choice , feels a bit alienating to those who do n't speak Spanish . I found myself mostly bored with a lot of the tracks and feeling as if many of the songs had a similar sound to them . However , I 've heard from others who do know Spanish that they feel this is probably her best effort yet and that the lyrics are the sharpest they 've been in a while and passionately written . So , depending on your knowledge of Spanish , I think you 'll either really enjoy this release or it 'll feel somewhat off-putting . It did n't help that as usual a few of the tracks are actually the same track , simply done in another language . To me , she should have done either an all Spanish album or done more English . The Spanish/English tracks for the most part were the weakest tracks but those that were all Spanish with no `` translation '' track were stronger , more compelling and better produced.In all , Eh . Personally , I really expected a lot based on `` Loca '' but found the album to just feel too reserved and safe for Shakira 's usual standards . I did n't hear any real stand-out , billboard 100-worthy tracks on 'Sale El Sol ' and that 's not necessarily bad . She seems to have taken a bold decision in making an album that 's a bit understated and takes her back to her roots . Still , I was hoping for something compelling and interesting but after a few listens ca n't bring myself to replay many of these tracks.Listen to These : `` Antes de las Seis '' , `` Rabiosa '' , `` Devoci & oacute ; n '' ."}, "22657": {"id": "22656", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Major disappointment again from the world 's greatest voice , I have to say that a couple of songs are not extremely bad ( Sale el sol is tolerable ) , but the album overall is a pain to listen to , what a departure from `` Pies Descalzos '' , where are you , the Shakira of 1996 ? ! ? !"}, "22658": {"id": "22657", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I bought this cd on a spur of the moment .

How did they happen ? What do they mean ? Pass the peace pipe , kids , and I 'll tell you a story that may make you -- - depending on your age -- - nostalgic or jealous.We start with Alex Ebert , lead singer of a band called Ima Robot . He is cynical and negative , drunk on a daily basis . Desperate to be someone else , he breaks up the band , leaves his girlfriend for a small apartment with a blow-up mattress and joins Alcoholics Anonymous . A year later , Ebert has written many pages about Edward Sharpe , who was `` sent down to Earth to heal and save mankind -- - but he kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love . `` Then , in downtown Los Angeles , he meets Jade Castrinos . They `` hit it off and made a run for freedom . '' They start writing songs . They acquire a school bus and a band.Want yet another reason to mourn Heath Ledger ? He gives the band seed money to record a CD . Which they do -- - using a 24-track tape machine from 1979 and bargain-basement reels of 2-inch tape . '' In July of 2009 , the launch party for `` Up from Below '' was , unsurprisingly a benefit , with the money going to help the Gulu Widows Group of Uganda start a farm to sustain their community . And then they went on the road ... .The young ` uns and the folks who missed it first time around know hippies only as caricatures . Ebert 's much closer to the real deal : `` If we go to your town , I can imagine a time when we 're rolling up to a parking lot and parking the bus and setting up the stage and the bleed from the audience to us , it 's just not even there . It 's like a river , you know ? `` Audiences do know . And they jump in . Ebert : `` The night I went into the crowd [ at the Echo ] and everybody was singing , you could almost feel their hearts . `` That 's pretty much any night for this band . Because what it offers is not being sold anywhere else -- - a reversion to childhood . He 's a child and she 's a child , and they have a childish belief that their love will last forever , and the band feels the same way . That 's a lot of permission on one stage.Enduring love , a family of friends , a place that felt like home -- - when I stumbled out of college into the Real World , I craved nothing more . Escapism ? Maybe . But also a recognition that the Real World is n't the only one , that there 's a door over here , and all you have to do is open it to feel the freedom you had as a kid.See Edward Sharp , if you can .

And quite frankly , I really have n't found anybody who has appeared on that show to be grilled by the caustic Simon Cowell , the `` dawgish '' Randy Jackson , or the seemingly under-the-influence Paula Abdul that really makes me believe in its supposed good points ... at least not until now.Brooke White , who , although she did n't win , did manage to finish inside the Top 5 during `` Idol '' 's 2008 season , did , in fact , stand out from practically everyone else that ever appeared on the show . With the seeming obsession amongst the `` hip '' judges towards overwrought vocal showboating , be it R & B ; , country ( yes , I do mean you , Carrie ! ) , or Top 40 pop ( Kelly Clarkson ) , Brooke caught everyone 's attention with a very credible version of Carly Simon 's classic 1972-73 # 1 smash `` You 're So Vain '' , and revealed a 1970s California singer/songwriter sensibility . And with HIGH HOPES & HEARTBREAK , her second album overall ( after the pre-Idol SONGS FROM THE ATTIC ) , she channels that influence into her own style , based in the past but with a refreshingly contemporary sound.Randy Jackson , getting away from the `` dawg '' days of `` Idol '' , serves as executive producer of this album ; and with the exception of `` Use Somebody '' , a Kings of Leon cover , everything on HIGH HOPES & HEARTBREAK was co-written by Brooke . If her voice does n't have quite the heft of those she emulated during `` Idol '' ( Carly ; Joni Mitchell ; Carole King ; Linda Ronstadt ) , it 's nevertheless much better than average , with no extreme vocal gymnastics , arrangements redolent of Southern California 's glorious past , and a solid songwriting intelligence ( `` Radio Radio '' ; `` Hold Up My Heart '' ; `` California Song '' ; `` Phoenix '' [ an ode to her home town ] ) that you really do n't get a whole lot of anymore on the radio.For those contemporary radio listeners who just want something different , this should really be essential .

There are hints of country in the piano and guitars , but White relies in large part on the Carole King style she brought to her performances on AI . Unfortunately such a nakedly retro album would have little chance in the modern radio market , and so her producers have dressed things up with orchestrations that , despite the drippy George Harrison-styled guitars , tend to generic modern.The album opens promisingly with the retro styling and starry eyes of `` Radio Radio , '' a tune whose quivery emotion and chorus hook would fit perfectly between top-40 hits by Carly Simon and Gilbert O'Sullivan . White 's heartfelt emotion threads through other tracks , but occasionally finds itself competing with the orchestrations . Particularly egregious is the dance beat and disco style of the title track . Still , she uses her upper range to add terrific emotional trills on `` Out of the Ashes , '' and sings with a directness that is enchanting . Similarly , her lower range on `` Phoenix '' is tremendously warm and inviting . White co-wrote eleven of the twelve songs , offering up mid-tempo numbers and piano-based ballads , and adds a cover of Kings of Leon 's `` Use Somebody . `` Having taken the indie route , rather than releasing her album through the AI machine , one might have hoped she 'd stay true to her unique musical assets .

With their fourth release , The Ruminant Band , Johnson & Co. continue to live up to their reputation as musical blacksmiths and the title itself . A ruminant is a mammal with four stomachs , giving it the ability to digest and re-digest food to extract the maximum amount of nutrients from a single bite , and with The Ruminant Band , the Fruit Bats have again created a record of many disparate angles , Johnson 's viewpoint on the past forty years of music chewed and re-chewed into a distinctly Fruit Bats release.Johnson has always been a hard talent to pin down , but his penchant for combining many different styles into a seamless whole remains intact . It 's been four years since the Fruit Bats ' last , but those four years ( four stomachs , anyone ? ) , which have had Johnson become a member of the Shins and the Fruit Bats fall by the wayside , seem to have only ignited Johnson 's creativity further . The Ruminant Band runs the gamut from classic rock ` n roll in the Neil Young vein to light summer pop reminiscent of Elephant 6 groups , and while nothing here is mind-blowingly original or particularly revolutionary , it is a fresh , solid collection of intimate alternative.Opener `` Primitive Band '' stomps along a ` 70s rock groove and a completely unfettered solo , while guitars ring and twang like the Allman Brothers on the titular track and the country-fried , fuzzed-out `` My Unusual Friend . '' Johnson 's vocals , which call to mind a nasally mix between the Minus 5 's Scott McCaughey and Kevin Barnes with a more country bent , stay in a higher register for most of the time here . His rather twee , always emotive pipes make a hokey chorus like `` I 'll never snow on your parade / I 'll never bring a cloudy day '' on the excellent `` Tegucigalpa '' an earnest promise rather than a corny sentiment , and stand in perfect contrast to the rugged , full-bodied instrumentation on display throughout.The album peaks in the middle , beginning with the wistful acoustic strummer `` Beautiful Morning Light , '' which would have sounded perfectly at home on Fleet Foxes ' debut . `` The Hobo Girl '' and `` Being On Your Own '' are the record 's highlight , the first rollicking along a honky-tonk piano melody and a campfire sing-a-long chorus , while the latter is a jaunty pedal-steel exercise with a syncopated barroom piano backbeat.The Ruminant Band is a collection that could be looked at closely , noting the intricate licks and gospel shading of `` Feather Bed , '' the soft carnival synthesizers on closer shuffling closer `` Flamingo , '' or the way Johnson 's vocals occasionally bend towards the darker in lyrics like those on `` Singing Joy To The World . '' But it 's best looked at as a summer album , one that rides along an open , instinctively American highway into a future uncertain , but one defiantly promising and undoubtedly optimistic . In its celebration of music past and present , from the rangy guitars and pounding , Fleetwood Mac-esque piano riffs to Johnson 's undeniable modern pop sensibilities and jangly , sun-soaked melodicism , The Ruminant Band is a record that without a doubt recycles , but makes sure to waste nothing in doing so ."}, "22688": {"id": "22687", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Not quite as ethereal as the transcendent `` Tripper '' and cheerier than the countrified `` echolocation , '' `` The Ruminant Band '' contains sweet , highly infectious , acoustic-based songs that are among the Fruit Bats ' best .

That title belongs toDaydream ( 1995 ) . But every track has something to add to the collection and flows very easily into the next . The lyrics on the album are OK to occasionally great ( see `` H.A.T.E.U . '' and `` Angels Cry '' ) . For modern Mariah nothing is bad , nor should you be surprised by any of the content.My favorite track here by far is `` Angels Cry '' which is towards the end of the disc . The song is a piano-woven ballad with a backbeat and vulnerable lyrics like we 're used to from Mariah . I could see this being on a future greatest hits collection for sure . The surprising `` Betcha Gon Know ( The Prologue ) '' shows the darkest side I 've probably seen in Mariah . It provides an excellent , descriptive opener but is n't completely what this mainly love-themed album is about . Other standouts include the highly anticipated `` H.A.T.E.U . '' which is one of the few ballads on the album ( and is one of the best ) , the stomping `` Standing O '' , the lush `` Languishing ( Interlude ) '' and the bouncy single `` Up Out My Face '' .The only problem I have with this disc is that it is almost pure mid-tempos . Mariah goes fast on a few tracks and there are like 4 or 5 ballads . The rest of the tracks are neither slow or fast really , they are at a medium tempo and start to blend after a while . Not that they sound exactly the same but I think that 's an issue.I 'm a huge fan of Mariah and expected a lot of this album . I anticipated it for months and months and months after the slight disappointment ofE=MC2 . The vocals here are n't bad at all and to be fair they are less whispery than they were on Charmbracelet .

This album is reminiscent of Butterfly . It 's something different , something new , and yet it 's still classic Mariah Carey.Mariah usually does n't break the formula and always has her debut single as the first track on the album and then releases a ballad as the second , but this time around she has opted to have it be track number two . The album gets off to a great start with one of my favorite tracks `` Betcha Gon Know '' and then gets right into the fast paced energy of `` Obsessed . '' The album is pretty mellow and most of the tracks are semi-ballads , or mid-range up tempo R & B ; tracks . Obsessed is probably the only track on the album that is very upbeat , so to speak . Almost every track on her I can listen to without skipping , so that speaks volumes in itself . Betcha Gon Know , Obsessed , H.A.T.E.U. , Up Out of My Face , are ridiculous R & B ; tracks that are saturated with strong drug like hooks that just reels you in from the get go . I think Mariah has really channeled her creative energy into creating a splendid album that teeters on borderline masterpiece.I loved E=MC2 more then i did Mimi and feel a lot of the tracks were radio friendly . However , she did work with many different producers which lead that album to have a feeling of `` Being all over the place . '' Also , the fact that Cruise Control or Migrate was not the second single was also a big reason as to why the album did n't go ten times platinum . But on her latest release you do not get a sense of an album was all over the place . She works with two of the same producers on the entire album , so there is n't a feeling of a compiled mess on MOIA.Mariah has stated herself that she is giving BUTTERFLY on this album and in some respect , yes and then some , no ! The album definitely runs more fluid then her last album , but she does n't work with former longtime collaborator , Walter Atansieff . There is also no production by longtime friend Jermaine Dupri . I wish there were a few JD tracks on here because MC & JD always have great chemistry & always churn out the hits !

Plus , you also get the music video for Obsessed . For ten bucks with all these extra - I am a happy camper . As stated before , Mariah really is an artist who lives and breathes music . You can tell this by the simple fact that she releases a new album practically every two years . Unlike Whitney Houston who seems to release an album once a decade . But I am a fan of both . But Mariah definitely blows `` I Look Too You '' out of the water with her new release . U GO MARIAH ! Give Whitney a run 4 her MONEY !

Nope , not just Mariah , but her usual good music . I was so disappointed with E=MC2 because each song did n't really have any originality and most sounds alike in some way . The only good thing about that album was that Mariah sounded like she had fun . However , let 's move on to `` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel . '' This new studio album seems so personal to Mariah . The lyrics are so easily understood and indulged into . And also this time , the music is more original than the music she produced in the past . `` Emancipation of Mimi '' have been my favorite `` new Mariah '' era but I have to say that `` Memoirs '' is better than `` Emancipation . '' The album was very enjoyable from top to bottom . Songs that really stood out in the album were `` Standing O , '' `` Obsessed , '' `` Angel 's Cry , '' and the rest of the songs are equally as great as three.I am so proud of Mariah and will continue to support her !

Highly recommend this new album ."}, "22699": {"id": "22698", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Mariah Carey really did her thing with this album !

This album is HIGHLY recommended for Mariah fans..HIGHLY !"}, "22700": {"id": "22699", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "On Monday the 21st of September I happened to receive an advanced copy of this marvelous release from the greatest vocal talent of our generation ; Mariah Carey ( a quick note to all you sticklers who think I 'm robbing the artist of her due by getting an ` advanced ' copy , I pre-ordered this from Amazon as well , so she got paid ) . After listening to this non-stop for a week ( and by non-stop I mean NON-STOP ) I can honestly say that I have not been this excited about Mariah since I first heard ` Butterfly ' ( which still remains the greatest R & B ; record of all time ) . This is by far her most consistent and cohesive album since ` Butterfly ' and is certainly going to win her quite a few Grammy 's this year ; guarantied.For anyone who was a little put-off by her last effort , ` E=MC2 ' ( an album I raved yet after repeated listens have found to be a solid yet less than truly impressive offering ) , have no worries , for ` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ' strips away the ` rap ' influences and delivers a solid R & B ; album that is reminiscent of late-90 's Mariah . Think ` Daydream ' with the modern touches of ` Butterfly ' . While ` The Emancipation of Mimi ' was truly Mariah 's comeback ; ` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ' is a superior album that will prove to be a career highlight for the diva above all other divas.The two singles off the album ( the Eminem directed ` Obsessed ' and the Foreigner cover ` I Want to Know What Love Is ' ) really help establish for the listener just what this album is all about . It has the layers of cheeky fun we expect from the same artist who dropped ` Honey ' on us all those years ago , but it also possessed the polished classiness that comes from years of refining your skills.Starting the album off fiercely , ` Betcha Gon Know ' is just that ; fierce . The track recounts Mariah 's dismay as she uncovers her lover involved in a tryst right there in her own bedroom . With pulsating beats that compliment Mariah 's delicate vocal delivery , this is a priceless way to open the album . What is wonderful about this album is that it really takes full advantage of what it has under its sleeve . By opening and closing that album with two of the best tracks on the album ( not the best , but two ` of the best ' ) it gets us hooked immediately and keeps us intrigued even when it 's nearly over , making us yearn to listen to it all over again ( which is what I 've been doing for a week now ) . ` H.A.T.E.U . ' is my personal favorite track on the album ; simply devastatingly perfect . Mariah has such a stunning control over her vocal 's here , going from soft whispers to deep and commanding sincerity and then escalating up to her dynamic powerful range without ever once ` overdoing ' it . The track is also a beautifully composed look at the death of love and the desire to make the one who 's hurt you feel even just a sliver of what they have put you through , with rich lyrical content that is moving and believable. ` Candy Bling ' has a coolness about it that carries the track from the stereo to your eardrums , resting easy in this syrupy sweet vibe that is easy to fall into . The snaps that help make up the musical melody are reminiscent of the feeling in your soul as you fall into Mariah 's trance and become engulfed in her manufactured mood . Tracks like ` Ribbon ' , ` Inseparable ' and ` More Than Just Friends ' take that classical Mariah sound and give it a modern update that makes it as relevant as anything accessible on the radio today , yet it remains slightly refined by Mariah 's otherworldly talents . ` It 's a Wrap ' has a laid back feel to it that suits Mariah 's vocals nicely ; even if I find this to be my least favorite track on the album . It is very ` Daydream ' Mariah ; for it possesses a familiarity about it that makes it almost slip beneath the rest of the album , which possesses a ` pop ' that this song does n't have. ` Up Out My Face ' is a fun , bouncy and energetic club ready romp that reminds me much of something off ` The Emancipation of Mimi ' or even ` E=MC2 ' ; like a combination of ` Shake it Off ' and ` Cruise Control ' . It is one of the most memorable tracks on the album , and it further proves that Mariah does n't need a think ballad to expose her marvelous vocal talents.BTW , that whole spill at the end about being Lego 's and having that Harvard graduating class of 2010 unable to put them back together is , in a word , brilliant.Next to the sublime ` H.A.T.E.U . ' stands ` Standing O ' , one of the most engaging and emotionally stirring tracks on the album . Mariah here again fluctuates with her vocal abilities , much like on ` H.A.T.E.U . ' except with a more upbeat musical arrangement which results in a very different yet equally satisfying sound . Just the way she hits `` I gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it '' is so reaching and affecting.Chills.What Mariah Carey album would be complete without a few heartfelt and moving ballads ? Well , leave it to Mariah to come through , giving us two beautifully composed ballads ( that 's not counting ` I Want to Know What Love Is ' ) . The first is ` The Impossible ' , which makes good use of its silky vibe and Mariah 's piercing whispers to deliver some of the albums most childish lines that work amazingly here , capturing the childlike purity of love ( lines like `` I love you like a milkshake '' may seem corny , but they are shockingly accurate when you consider the way true love makes one feel ; and that line about `` laying in the bed bumping Jodeci '' is flawless ) . Even better is the soaring ` Angels Cry ' which I 've even claimed to be the best song off of ` Butterfly ' , it 's that reminiscent of her most beloved work.So , my final verdict is this ; ` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ' is classic Mariah with all the right tweaks and twists to make it one of her most impressive and memorable efforts . Mariah has had her fair share of # 1 hits and high record sales , but this is certainly up there with ` Daydream ' and ` Butterfly ' as one of her best offerings to date . It flows effortlessly from track to track , as if each track was specifically written and placed for optimum listening experience creating a magical collection of superb R & B ; hits that will seduce and comfort you.Mariah Carey deserves nothing less than a standing ovation ."}, "22701": {"id": "22700", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "yo this cd is madd tight , and my boo is sexy as hell and deff a good singer not one bad song off this joint ... ..excellent ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"}, "22702": {"id": "22701", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Mariah Carey 's 12th studio album `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' is different from her most recent musical releases . Upon first listening to this release , I did n't like it . It lacked the upbeat , celebratory , playful Mariah that `` The Emancipation of Mimi '' ushered in ; the album did n't have as many radio friendly songs as `` E=MC2 '' had . `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' features a very mature-sounding artist . The pop/hip-hop sound that is heavy on her most recent releases , including the lead single 'Obsessed ' , is n't really present on this release . If I had to describe this to album to a Mariah fanatic , I would say this release is a hybrid of the ballad/slow jams from `` Butterfly '' , with a vibe of the `` Rainbow '' album . Vocally , it 's on level with `` Rainbow '' , `` Emancipation of Mimi '' , `` E=MC2 '' -- Yes , she still sings , and yes 'the voice ' is still there and very present but she stays in a mid-range/throaty vocal range with the high-notes being woven into the background rather than being up-front and on display . This may be a turn-off for some fans who want the Mariah Carey from the early 1990s back ; but I can say after a few listens , I think `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' has more of a backbone than `` E=MC2 '' and has a much stronger theme and concept that bring all the songs together , a strength that I felt was missing from `` Emancipation of Mimi . `` The Good : I like that this is Carey 's first real attempt at tackling a theme album . Each song deals with love or a relationship and in many ways , the album goes from heartache/breakup and pessimism toward finding love and a perfect lover to ending on a high note with , strangely enough , classic Mariah back on display with high notes , wide range and feeling more open and expressive . To me , the theme and the fact that every song deals with another aspect of love or a relationship made this album far more coherent and stronger than some of her more recent albums . In many ways , this is an album of ballads ; many that sound as if they 've been crafted over the course of the past few albums she 's done but are just now being released . I also enjoyed that finally Carey ventured into new musical territory . While `` Mimi '' and `` E=MC2 '' were good , they felt very safe and far too generic . The music featured on `` Memoirs '' is truly different ; you notice she 's taken a new musical direction from the very dark/moody 'Betcha Gon ' Know ' and on the gospel-tinged `` I Want To Know What Love Is '' and `` Angels Cry '' . There were only a few songs that felt boring . Unlike on `` E=MC2 '' , though you can tell Carey 's fascination of love and relationships is inspired by her personal life , the songs are n't all sappy and loving ; there 's the good love , the breakup , the anger , the hurt and optimism that comes with trying to find love and falling for someone all on display . Mariah 's song writing skills are also on display ; yes , some of the lyrics are simple and uncomplicated and a little child-like ( the many references and comparisons of love to that of food , for example ) but I found the music , lyrically and instrumental-wise , far more fresh and polished than on the past two or three albums.The Bad : One of my complaints is that while many of the songs are good , they feel as if they are building to something only to be clipped off or ended abruptly . 'More Than Just Friends ' is a fun , upbeat songs ( one of the few on the album ) and just as Mariah is getting into the song and letting her voice go , the song fades out and just ends and the next song starts up and leaves the last thought/song unfinished . It gives the album a big of a choppy feel . I 'd have liked it if the songs would have more easily segued into one another as 'Languishing ' fades into 'I Want To Know What Love Is ' . The sequencing of the album is okay but some songs felt a bit out of place in the line-up . To go from the moody/stirring 'Betcha Gon ' Know ' to the stark , hip-hop 'Obsessed ' when 'H.A.T.E.U . ' or 'It 's a Wrap ' better finishes the theme/thought introduced in 'Betcha Gon ' Know ' sort of perplexed me . Or , the album version of 'I Want To Know With ' edits out the sparkling , classic Mariah vocals and high notes in the closing section that 's present in the raido edit . Why ? Packaging wise , I was n't crazy about the cover or the fact that there 's a mini advertisement for ELLE magazine included with a feature about Mariah 's relationship with Nick Cannon and pushing some other products . I liked that this was 2-cds but I 'd have been more interested in either having more songs , or different takes , interpretations , remixes of various tracks than to basically be given the 'Obsessed ' maxi single . To me , it gives `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' a cheap , manufactured pure commercial product feel when that is n't the vibe of the album at all.In all , I highly recommend this album . It has a few 'imperfections ' but when you get down to it , I feel the music itself is some of Mariah Carey 's best work of the 2000s and showed how she 's maturing and starting to take a few more chances with her music . `` Memoirs '' feels like a bold statement and move for her ; there 's no carbon copies of the sound or music that made `` ... Mimi '' a big hit ; it 's less commercial than the radio-friendly `` E=MC2 '' . This may be what will make `` Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel '' either one of the best albums ( thus far ) of her career or the most underrated . Either way , do n't fall victim to the lack of promotion or bad press ; this album is not a flop , it is not bad , it is worth purchasing and listening to . Check it out.Listen To These Tracks : 'H.A.T.E.U .

Coming less than 18 months after E=MC2 , which was considered rather similar to the 2005 's acclaimed comeback `` The Emancipation of Mimi '' , even myself was not decided to give it a try . Apparently , I was not alone . Even with postponed release dates , `` Memoirs '' had a lesser commercial success than any of its two predecessors - and produced no No.1 single - something that the singer sometimes had too much emphasized in her career.This all aside , I was more than happy when I got a chance to listen to the album - Mariah cast all pretense aside ( the cover may be misleading , as there is no visible sign of breaking from the sexy uniformity of previous covers ) and made a classic r & b ; album , helmed by just one major producer duo , The Dream and Tricky Stewart . After a few listens it is really clear : Those who assert that this is the best Mariah since `` Butterfly '' ( 1997 ) are right ! The singer-songwriter 's knack for melodies is intact , as witnessed in the tracks like `` H.A.T.E.U . '' or `` Ribbon '' . The Dream and Tricky 's contribution is clearly audible as well , particularly on tracks like `` Standing O '' , which reminds of them-wheeled Rihanna 's super smash `` Umbrella '' . Less robotic than that 2007 hit , however , Carey 's album overflows with warmth , soulful grooves and is free of melismatic singing that used to put off many casual listeners.The lead single `` Obsessed '' is as catchy as the 2008 No.1 hit `` Touch My Body '' . Similar melodic and lyric motives show up every now and then , giving the album a satisfying sense of fulfilment . Finishing with `` I Want to Know What Love Is '' ( where the gospel choir is sounding strangely tame , as if going half-steam ) , the album is a testimony to Mariah 's often-underrated artistry and although it is probably not good enough to win new fans , it 's a cohesive bag which probably shows the singer in her real state , giving fans a chance to live things with her .

She does not lay back and let other people write her songs for her . She writes 90 % of her material and has from day one . There is a reason that not many people cover any of Mariah 's songs . No one can do them justice the way she can . Yes there are other singers with range like hers and maybe they can even go as high in octaves as she can , but there really is no one JUST like her . From stepping on the scene when she was nearly 18 years old and to be still going this strong at nearly 40 says something . She has always played an active part in the creative process . The songs are truly HERS . While not possessing a 'perfect ' discography ( ahem , glitter ? charmbracelet ? ) there 's still no denying that Mariah 's talent is immense and she 's not going anywhere anytime soon . 'Memoirs ' is like a throwback to really great , classic r & b ; records of back in the day . I ca n't really compare it to any of Mariah 's other albums because its something different . Mariah 's voice has gotten this almost smoky quality to it that surely can only come from age . This is n't a bad thing at all though . It gives the songs this extra sultry , alluring layer ... I almost like it even more now than back when it was the ultra pristine Voice singing Vision of Love and Someday and Butterfly even . She has really come into her own on this new album.Do yourself a favor and listen to it from start to finish , as its meant to be . Mariah herself has said that this album is more `` story-like '' than any of her others -- she 's also said that it is her most personal and honest album to date.Before listening to this , I scanned the track list names and was kind of skeptical ... the actual song titles being kind of silly/cheesy at times . I looked at them and was almost expecting the worst , y'know like some obnoxious rap-collaboration that totally does n't showcase Mariah 's voice and songwriting . I was very pleasantly surprised when this did n't happen . So do n't let the titles discourage you.If I had to just use key words to sum this release up , I would say this : Smoothe , sultry , clever , original , catchy.I absolutely love this new album , and I hope it gets the appreciation it deserves . Mariah 's `` in love for the first time '' as she has said , and it shows . A happy Mariah equals sublime music.Highlights : Betcha Gon Know- Mariah witnesses the ultimate betrayal and plots her revenge -- '' Betcha gon know how it feels/When I get you back / Betcha gon know how it feels/When your heart 's been cracked/Betcha gon know how it feels/When we Fade to Black/ ... And you see your whole world collapse ... /I 'm a La-la-la-la-laugh '' , H.A.T.E.U , which stands for `` Having a Typical Emotional Upset '' , is a slow and sultry ballad that 's extremely addictive and trance like . The music/beats are reminiscent of Ciara 's hit `` Promise '' , but the lyrics and sentiment are completely different . `` I ca n't wait to hate you/Make you pain like I do '' . Obsessed has funny lyrics and a ridiculously catchy chorus -- `` Got you All fired up with your Napolean complex/See right through you like your bathin ' in Windex '' , `` I 'm a press conference/You a conversation/You a Mom & Pop ; /I 'm a corporation '' . In Standing O , Mariah mocks a shady ex `` You played the one that loved you the most/So here 's your Standing O '' . There are several others I could quote but you get the idea . All in all I would give it a B+ . ( Note : Die hard Mariah fans will definitely want to buy the physical copy and not just iTune this cd . The album packaging itself is beautiful and has a really cute `` mini magazine '' in place of actual liner notes . There 's lots of little personal Mariah tidbits sprinkled on the pages , and on the actual inside casing there are pictures of Mariah 'back in the day ' side by side current 'Memoirs 2009 ' photos ... she recreated 3 of her most famous photos , and it 's really cool to see as a big MC fan . )"}, "22707": {"id": "22706", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel , is Mariah Carey ' 12th studio album and her best since 1997 's Butterfly .

And while I typically do n't read many professional reviews when it comes to Mariah , I did come across a snippett of a review that I felt really says something.Allmusic states `` any Mariah Carey album carries a lot of weight -- fan dreams , commercial expectations , the prospect of genuine pop thrill , the star 's outsized persona -- and 2009 's Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel is no different . `` Such a true and objective statement when it comes to Mariah . Memoirs is being touted as the modern Butterfly . Having listened to it first on her myspace page , I got the sense of where this may be true . Primarily because of the interludes and some of the club mixes . I really felt , as did a few others , that it was a cross between Butterfly and Daydream because that is when we got to see Mariah integrate pure R & B ; tracks on a predominantly pop cd.Make no mistake , Memoirs is pure R & B . ; The only thing pop about it from my perspective was the last track `` I want to know what love is '' . Memoirs is different in that she collaborated with the same producers throughout making the cd more cohesive than anything she 's done recently.Vocally , Memoirs showcases every moment in her career and I find that she easily weaves between different singing styles effortlessly , making this one of the most colorful vocal offerings that I 've seen . It is ever more clear to me how vocally talented Mariah really is.Lyrically , Memoirs is more hip , but I personally do n't feel that the hipness that she exudes is overdone or out of place . It is very current in this respect . Some , however , will not be pleased with Mariah no matter what she does unless she goes back to singing like she did in 1990 both lyrically and vocally . The interlude `` Languishing '' clearly shows that Mariah can sing songs like she did in 1990 , and while I enjoy those type of songs , I could n't help but feel that it could have been on any of Mariah 's earlier work . So I think I understand why Mariah does n't sing those type of songs anymore.Again , agreeing with Allmusic , a lot of expectations come from a Mariah cd . When it boils down , you will either love it or hate it . Personally , I love it . I too feel that it is better than E=MC2 . It is pure R & B ; and not as contemporary as Emancipation.Standout tracks : H.A.T.E.UBetcha Gon ' KnowAngels CryRibbonCandy Bling"}, "22716": {"id": "22715", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "As a Mariah Carey fan , I always get excited when I hear rumblings about getting new music from her . I was slightly disappointed with her last release E=MC2 but after hearing the lead single , OBSESSED ( which grew on me each time I saw the darkly comedic video ) , I hoped that I 'd enjoy the whole album as much as the single . I received my copy this past Saturday and have listened to the entire album a few times and wanted to add my two cents.First the superficial - the packaging . I 'm somewhat of a `` girly girl '' at heart so I loved the digi-packaging and the mini-Elle magazine included . I will always be obsessed with Mariah 's closet so any chance I get to see pix of it , it 's a treat ! Also the re-creations of her previous album covers was a fun touch - she looks so easy , breezy & happy in the new pix.On to the music - this album has and is growing on me the same way that CHARMBRACELET did and like with TEOM , I seem to have a new favorite track every hour ! On the first listen there were definitely songs that stood out to me in a positive way while others took a few listens for me to warm up to but overall this collection has been quite enjoyable to listen to . I 've said this about other `` veterans '' of this music biz but I applaud Mariah for still having enough `` fire in her guts '' to continue to put music out there for people to enjoy.Songs on repeat and ripped to my mp3 : CANDY BLING - despite the indulgent title , this is a really pretty trackANGELS CRY - this track reminds me of WE BELONG TOGETHER/DO N'T FORGET ABOUT US somewhat but I love everything about it both the musical & vocal production ( it also got me imagining a video treatment so I hope it gets a chance as a single ) LANGUISHING - this is a truly beautiful song , the lyrics & production are fantastic and my only regret is that it 's an interlude & not a full trackOBSESSED - this song definitely grew on me over the summer , it 's catchy and the beats do n't overpower Mariah 's vocalsRIBBON - once the digitized male voice stops and the song gets rolling I loved itINSEPARABLE - another song that is reminiscent of a Bryan Michael Cox track featuring a really pretty piano accompaniment but the booming beats used make it stand out differentlyUP OUT MY FACE - loved the way that the harder beats gave what could 've been just another pretty sounding track an edgeBETCHA GON KNOW - dark moody openerI WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS - solid re-interpretation of a classic tune but just as I was really diggin ' it , it fades outSongs that are growing on me but s-l-o-w-l-y : H.AT.E.U . - I like the vocal arrangement of the chorus but just do n't like it as much as a couple of the other balladsMORE THAN JUST FRIENDS - interesting arrangementTHE IMPOSSIBLE - personal lyrics"}, "22717": {"id": "22716", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Now do n't get me wrong . This can never be called her best work , but it is still a huge improvement over E=MC2 ( or anything that she 's made in the 2000s , for that matter ) , and perhaps admitting that she is in fact imperfect may be an important first step towards regaining some of the credibility that seemed to be so lost during the last few years . To start with , she seems to have finally come to the realization that her music sounds more enjoyable without guest rappers , and though her voice is still mostly gone , she actually does try hard to show that there 's still something left of it on the tracks `` It 's A Wrap '' and `` Angels Cry . '' She also makes a surprisingly good ( though not superior ) cover of the Foreigner classic `` I Want To Know What Love Is , '' and in general , this album is more mature and less hip-hoppish than some of her more recent efforts . Unfortunately , there are still some imperfect aspects of the album .

I do n't like how she skipped one full verse and that she turned a classic rock song to an r'n'b/soul song that could very well be listed into some D-list movie soundtrack . In my opinion , she would have been better off singing a cover of MJ 's song `` You Are Not Alone '' since it would be more fitting for this album and since he had died recently . 4/5Average rating : 4.0"}, "22722": {"id": "22721", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "For longtime followers of Mariah Carey 's music , `` Butterfly '' from 1997 remains her most enduring work - a gorgeous collection of tracks that worked as a 'concept album ' , and also individually - and some of the lesser known works from the album - `` Fourth of July '' , `` The Roof '' , and of course , the seminal `` Breakdown '' , remain some of the greatest songs ever recorded in R & B ; history.Which is why `` Memoirs '' is interesting on so many levels . Not only has Carey decided to revisit her R & B ; roots , she also pays homage to certain key musical forces along the way , most noticeably Marvin Gaye , and Sade . Those influences permeate this recording , and while it can loosely be called a 'concept album ' , it is sequenced in breathtaking fashion , with every song in the right place , not a note wrong ; and Carey 's infamous whistle register arrives at just the right places.The great thing about Mariah Carey 's music is that despite the glossy and overproduced elements of her early 1990s work , she has learnt to go with the times and make music that is current , yet always with a hint of throwback . Sadly , her last two records , while being eminently memorable , were n't quite in keeping with her usually solid output ( I also consider 'Charmbracelet ' to be a winning CD ; though highly underrated ) . `` Memoirs '' corrects that , because it seems to reject radio-friendly pop , and rather immerse itself in the very root of R & B ; - some songs sound like love-children of Maxwell , India Arie and Erykah Badu , and this can only be a good thing.The Erykah Badu comparisons are also very valid on certain key tracks on this record . Shades of Mary J. Blige ( especially on a key track entitled 'Hate U ' ) are all over the place , and Carey indulges the more bizarre sides of her ( an entire two minute track is composed of a high school brass band repeating the same line ad nauseum ) , and her lyrics often veer into strange , almost transcendent madness . Consider this : `` Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this when I break ; If we were two Lego blocks , even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 could n't put us back together again '' . Granted , things are n't always this far out . On most tracks , Carey sings about what she knows - love and relationships ; but it wears thin after a certain point.However , the music often makes up for the dubious lyrical content . Lead single 'Obsessed ' is the worst thing here , and sadly , some of the interludes could have worked as full-fledged songs themselves . Prime amongst these is `` Languising '' , easily Mariah 's greatest ballad since the incomparable `` Close My Eyes '' from `` Butterfly '' . The songwriting here is stellar , and only serves to reiterate that when Carey does it right , she really nails it . This one track is easily mightier than the entire output of `` E=MC2 '' , and marginally better than most anything on `` Emancipation '' ( save for 'We Belong Together ' ) .Also surprising are song choices that open and close the album . The Foreigner Cover at the end does n't sound quite appealing in the beginning , but a repeat listen convinces you of its ' greatness , at least for the first verse and chorus . This is n't a terrific song to close any album with , but it sounds comfortable and inspired enough to hold everything that came before it . And the gems here are many - `` Angels Cry '' has a killer chorus that would do great as a commercial single , and `` Standing O '' is something that grows on you , much like the latter half of her previous album.Whats especially convincing about `` Memoirs '' is that Mariah is n't trying very hard to 'sell out ' or garner any more No . 1 singles ( whether or not that happens is of no consequence anymore ) . What she HAS done is create an album that rivals 1997s ' `` Butterfly '' in terms of novelty and creativity . The unfortunately titled `` Candy Bling '' is actually a stunning tune and lyric that acts as a befitting sequel to `` Underneath the Stars '' , and almost every song here some sort of reference point on `` Butterfly '' . For that alone , I can award this five stars.An artist in her element . Listened to purely as an auditory experience and not as a commercial product , this ranks very highly amongst Carey 's vast back-catalog . Five Stars ."}, "22723": {"id": "22722", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Arguably stronger than 2005 's Grammy-winningThe Emancipation of Mimi - Platinum Edition , if slightly less fun than 2008 's underratedE=MC2 , 2009'sMemoirs of an Imperfect Angelmarks several departures and several new directions for the pop/R & B ; singer/songwriter . 'Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel 's ' title alone insinuated this would be a completely different Mariah Carey album than she 's done in the recent past . If 'The Emancipation of Mimi ' was her 'comeback ' after the incredulousGlitterand the forgettableCharmbracelet , and 2008 's E=MC2 sought to follow up that album with an album that had more 'hit records ' , 2009 's 'Memoirs ' recalls a personal Mariah Carey using her voice to greater heights . Without any guests and absent of Jermaine Dupri ( positive ) , 'Memoirs ' concedes the commercial appeal of Carey 's two past albums , save for 'Obsessed ' ( which failed to reach # 1 as the less enjoyable 'Touch My Body ' did ) in favor of a more coherent , personal outing this time . The numbers hurt ( # 3 bow , c. 168,000 copies vs. the # 1 , c. 463,000 opening of E=MC2 ) , but the results are more coherent.The album opens with an enjoyable , if slightly odd track entitled `` Betcha Gon ' Know ( The Prelude ) '' , which finds Mariah approaching this song in a 'narrative ' style , quite different from the club-leaning openers `` It 's Like That '' or `` Migrate '' . Here , the production by Tricky/The-Dream is exceptional , and a welcome departure from her Jermaine Dupri saturated previous albums ( though Tricky/The-Dream did produce `` Touch My Body '' ) . While `` Betcha Gon ' Know '' is enjoyable , it does n't scream 'commercial hit ' , particularly with its 'nutso ' punchlines ( Oprah , Stedman , Barbra Walters ? ) . `` Obsessed '' should have easily been another # 1 hit for Mariah Carey , particularly given the fact that the Black-Eyed Peas annoying `` I Got ta Feeling '' stayed # 1 shamefully for 14 weeks . However , `` Obsessed '' never quite clicked , despite the fact it is arguably one of Carey 's best and most interesting listens . Carey sounds great , and the production work by Tricky/The-Dream is fantastic . I honestly prefer it miles over `` Touch My Body '' . `` H.A.T.E . U '' , which follows , is equally alluring . `` H.A.T.E . U '' finds Carey singing softly and sensitively , with the end of the refrain allowing her to 'coo ' in her upper register like a 'songbird ' . Beautiful , passionate , this song where Mariah claims so resolutely , `` I Ca n't wait to hate u ... '' again does n't necessarily lend itself to the commercial appeal of say `` We Belong Together '' or `` Do n't Forget About Us '' . `` Candy Bling '' proves to be another fantastic listen which finds Carey in strong voice . `` Ribbon '' borrows production cues from The-Dream 's great 'Love v. Money ' album , penning a sensitive sounding diva against harder drums . The effect is spectacular , and again makes you wonder , why such a downgrade in numbers ? `` Inseparable '' , another production standpoint ( even if it sounds somewhat samey compared to other tracks ) , finds Mariah again sounding top-rate and the material 'sells ' itself easily . The main problem the listener may find is that as good and consistent as the material is , some of it slightly begins to blend together . Though arguably , one could say the same for the two previous Carey releases . `` Standing O '' instantaneously shows the influence of Terius `` The-Dream '' Nash with the pervading `` oh 's '' and sound-effects that have come to characterize his style . `` Standing O '' is n't the most distinctive track of 'Memoirs ' , but as far as consistency , it is as consistent as everything else . `` It 's A Wrap '' ' proves to be a better , more enthralling listen , placing Mariah against a 'new-school ' soulful 6/8 beat . `` It 's A Wrap '' is one of Carey 's best vocal moments on this album , finding the diva 'belting it out ' as opposed to her sometimes restrained vocal performances . `` Up Out My Face '' , similarly , is an interesting listening . It 's subsequent reprise , remixed with marching band instrumentation ( `` Up Out My Face ( The Reprise ) '' ) is enjoyable and again plays on this 'comical ' Mariah Carey , most likely a product of The-Dream . `` More Than Just Friends '' is solid and as enjoyable as everything else , while `` The Impossible '' begins to exhibit the slight leanings of 'sameness ' . Solid , nonetheless . A reprise of `` The Impossible '' could 've been cut and would n't have been missed here . Similarly , `` Angel ( The Prelude ) '' is more filler than genuinely adding depth to the album . `` Angels Cry '' finds a sensitive Carey hearkening back to her adult contemporary laden roots . While `` Angels Cry '' does n't quite have the same vitality or depth as a classic such as `` Without You '' , it does 'recall ' and remind us of the original Mariah Carey . `` Languishing ( The Interlude ) '' could 've been extended to have made one fantastic song ; Carey is in great voice here . Finally , an exceptional cover of Foreigner 's classic `` I Want To Know What Love Is '' provides the cherry on top of this exceptional , if underrated Carey album.Essentially , Mariah Carey is more mature sounding on this album , especially compared to E=MC2 . Some will love it , some wo n't get it , and others will treat it much like Usher 's 2008 'Here I Stand ' - it makes Carey boring . While it is n't as exciting has her albums made of 'hit records ' , it is a better album because it finds Carey rediscovering her roots in big ballads and with songs that have lyrics with 'personal conviction ' . 4 stars ."}, "22724": {"id": "22723", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 'm not the biggest fan of Mariah Carey but a fan indeed .

Rather than chasing after the style of the latest flavor of the week , she chose to risk album sales and try something new . Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel is a slow burner meaning that it takes time to fully understand and enjoy it 's awesomeness . Yeah I stole part of that definition from Urban Dictionary , but you know what I mean.Making an album like that is a big risk for someone like Mariah . Especially coming off the comeback smash The Emancipation of Mimi . The follow-up E=Mc2 was n't a bad album , but it could 've used some work here and there . All is forgiven on Memoirs . For the most part anyway . The theme of this record is love and the ups and downs one can run into when falling in , out , and away from it . You 'd think an entire record about love would get redundant after awhile , but that 's not so here.Mimi is seeing red on the moody intro Betcha Gon ' Know . After catching her man cheating , she vows revenge . She 'll make sure he knows how it feels to be in pain `` when I get you back '' by putting him on blast to Oprah , Barbara Walters , and 60 Minutes . `` Betcha gon ' know how this feels/Even it is the last thing I ever do/To be continued ... '' I like Obsessed , but I do n't think it fits well on the album . Despite that , it 's a funny kiss off to Eminem who 's been going after Mariah ever since she denied having a relationship with him in 2002 . Just like her first Em brush off on Charmbracelet 's Clown , Mariah never addresses him by name , but makes it clear who she 's singing about . `` Why you so obsessed with me ? /Boy I wan na know/Lyin ' that you 're sexin ' me/when everybody knows/It 's clear that you 're upset with me/Oh , finally found a girl that you could n't impress/Last man on the earth still could n't get this '' she coyly teases.The ethereal glaze of H.A.T.E.U . gets the album back on the love track . Rather than continuing to miss and pine after her lover , Mariah wants to hate him for hurting her . `` I ca n't wait to hate you/Make you pain like I do/Still ca n't shake you off/I ca n't wait to break through these emotional changes/Seems like such a lose cause/I ca n't wait to face you/Break you down so low there 's no place left to go ! '' I love that her lower register gets to shine along with her higher . She rarely shows it off.Candy Bling is just as delicious as the title suggests . Backed by light finger snaps and music that reminds me of an ice cream truck , Mariah thinks back to her first romance and wishes she could relive it . `` Back in the day we were in love/We 're not in love anymore/But some days I sit and wish we were in love again/Irresponsible things we would do/Like fall asleep on the phone and skipping school/Now I 'm back to the future missing you . `` I 'm usually not a fan of the chopped and screwed genre , but it works on Ribbon . Probably because it 's an anonymous man 's voice in the background rather than Mariah 's . Who has n't been in a relationship where you 're so in love with that person they 've got you `` Wrapped up/Packed up/Ribbon with a bow on it '' ? Now here 's another question . Who has n't broken up with someone , but then realize it was a big mistake . Mariah certainly does on the piano groove Inseparable . She wants to call him up and makes things right , but her pride gets in the way . `` One of us just got ta pick the phone up/Cuz I know we 're still inseparable . '' Now we 're hitting a snag . The plot of Standing O is interesting about sarcastically applauding an ex lover for breaking her heart , but I do n't care for the music or Mariah 's repeated O 's . Sounds like something Rihanna would do.The doo wop of It 's A Wrap get 's things going again . Mariah told her guy if he messed up their relationship one more time she 'd drop him , but he did it anyway . `` Yet another early morning/And you walk in like it 's nothing/Hold up , hold up , hold tight/Ai n't no donuts/Ai n't no coffee/See I know you seen me calling and calling/I should crack you right in your forehead ! '' The lyrics are witty and silly like threatening to call Maury Povich because of his constant cheating . Only Mimi.She gets even wittier on the marching band led Up Out My Face . She 's so over her man that she 's packed her bags and is on her way out of his life for good . `` I 'm on the plane now/And do n't keep calling from your mama house/When I break , I break , boy '' and `` If we were two lego blocks/Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010/Could n't put us back together again . '' Mariah is routinely criticized for creating songs like this , but the joke is on the critics . Mimi 's just having fun . The reprise is fun to sing along to as well.More Than Just Friends is yet another `` I 'm in love with my best friend '' song , but Mariah 's off the wall lyrics make it anything but mediocre . `` Steady feenin ' for you like them fries at McDonalds/I want to be all on your lips like gelato/Permanently paint me in your picture like Picasso/Love me down 'til I hit the top of my soprano . '' You 've got ta love it ! Who knew Mimi could make such a seductive `` crawl under the sheets '' slow jam ? Do n't get me wrong , she 's sung plenty of sultry songs in the past , but I 've never heard her step into Janet territory . Minus the creepy , over the top sex , of course . Sampling Jodeci 's Forever My Lady , Mariah praises her hubby Nick Cannon for doing The Impossible and showing her that true love is real . She loves him like everything from a freeze pop and a Duncan Hines yellow cake to `` layin ' in the bed bumpin ' Jodeci . '' The lyrics are sweet and get their point across without being mushy . Speaking of Janet , the reprise sounds exactly like Any Time , Any Place.After a short interlude featuring a chorus of dreamy whistle notes , Mariah mourns the ending of a relationship on Angels Cry . Apparently the two were meant to be , but fighting and a case of the blame game caused them to break away from each other . `` True love 's a gift/But we let it drift/In a storm/Every night/I feel the angels cry . '' Languishing is reminiscent of another interlude that should 've been a full length song , Rainbow . Over a misty piano , Mariah admits that they 've both caused each other pain in the past , but wonders `` would you reach for me ? /If you saw that I was languishing/I was wondering/Would you cry for me ? /If I told you that I could n't breathe/If I was drowning/Suffocating/If I told you that I could n't breathe ? `` We reach the end of the road on the Foreigner hit I Want To Know What Love Is . I like that Mariah managed to make it her own and it 's stunning , but it 's too short . Just as the choir kicks in and the song is nearing it 's peak , it fades out . What 's up with that ? It could 've been epic , but alas . Something I could do without is the extra disc featuring a few remixes of Obsessed . They 're pretty good , but why add a handful of remixes of the same song ? That 's what a maxi single is made for.In closing , the cd is n't perfect , but it 's pretty close . To the people who listen to it a few times and deem it a flop , pay closer attention . This is the kind of music you have to let grow on you . You 'll be glad when it does ."}, "22727": {"id": "22726", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Mariah Carey is perhaps the only artist with a strong presence on Top 40 radio who has ( earned ) the leverage to write and record whatever she wants , how she wants . Because of this her 12th studio album `` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel '' is the product of a double-edged sword - Carey gets disarmingly personal , delightfully lowbrow and places between by sticking to her artistic inclinations , but at the same time she may disenfranchise casual fans who expect her sound to skew the way of previous hits.There are a handful of roaring , boom box busting tracks such as the increasingly catchy Top 10 hit single `` Obsessed '' ( when she unleashes her voice at the climax she 's singing `` he 's all up in my George Foreman ! '' ) and the cheeky , intentionally humorous break-up ode `` Up Out My Face '' ( `` If we were two Lego blocks even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010 could n't put us back together again '' ) . `` Ribbon '' is also a melodious marvel , with Carey gamely wrapping her throat around its jagged , luscious arrangement.The great bulk of `` Memoirs ... , '' however , skews toward steamy , sauna-warm slow jams with only occasional outbursts of that full-on chest voice of `` Hero '' and `` We Belong Together . '' The best cut in this vein is the wistful , bittersweet , positively glorious `` Candy Bling , '' which concludes with dazzling , fist-pumping , absolutely heartbreaking high notes . Also radio-bound is the downbeat , vacillating `` H.A.T.E.U. , '' which finds Carey immersed in the stifling ambiguities of post-relationship battle scars . Her aching , genuine vocal performance is the stuff of Grammy nominations.With deeper tracks like `` Standing O , '' where her vocals swirl and swell amid anxious underpinnings , or the lyrically curious `` It 's a Wrap , '' with old school vocal coos and handclaps , it is evident that Carey is not following any formula when she approaches recording albums - `` Memoirs ... '' contrasts greatly with the straightforward R & B ; and burning hip-hop of last year 's `` E=MC2 '' or 70s soul ballads of 2005 's `` The Emancipation of Mimi . '' However , this means there is room for missteps such as the adventurous but overloud `` More Than Just Friends '' and the cotton candy-like `` The Impossible , '' which floats like whipped cream as she tries to craft a slice of genuinely romantic quiet storm to mixed results . `` Angels Cry '' reinvigorates the album with its stark arrangement , Carey 's voice hanging unadorned in the mix for a wrenching call for a former love to return . It 's not single material , but it will satisfy those looking to hear her bust out a powerhouse vocal . So too will her plaintive , soul-searching take on Foreigner 's classic `` I Want to Know What Love Is . '' She sculpts the time-tested song into her own creation without compromising the integrity of the original , ending the album on an ambiguous note . `` Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel '' finds Carey closing out the 2000s in self-assured , take charge fashion . As time goes by one can sense , to an increasing degree , that she is crafting albums first and foremost to please herself . It does n't satisfy listeners who long for a return to her people-pleasing days of the early 90s , but it certainly makes her a more interesting artist ."}, "22728": {"id": "22727", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Mariah keeps doin her thing with another incredible album .

Why write a song about an aging tweaker bipolar balding ghetto white boy ? Obsessed Clown ( was n't the song Clown about him too ? ) Mariah gives him 2 much credit , but the song is kool.3 . Hate U : 4/5 another bitchy song with deep lyrics . `` I ca n't wait 2 hate u '' . I get it , the lyrics are about when ur finally OVER some1.4 . Candy Bling : 4/5 a cute song about romance , with lyrics borrowed from that Ahmad song from the 90 's `` Back In Tha Day '' .5 . Ribbon : 5/5 my fave song . It immediately made an impression on me . I luv Mariah 's vocals , they have that 80 's and 90 's r and b sound , intense ! 6 . Inseperable : 5/5 this song grew on me , more intense vocals .

Up Out M ' Face : 4/5 another bitchy song ! luv and hate , we go back n forth on this album . Mariah calls this guy `` Boy '' . uh oh no u did n't Mariah ! 10 . More Than Jus Friends : 5/5 m ' other fave track . I luv the vocals and the lyrics ! 11 . The Impossible : ur standard Mariah ballad remeniscent of her more recent ballads . This song is about her cookie luv affair with Nick . The reprise resmebles the instrumentation of `` Anytime , Anyplace '' by Janet Jackson . I like the reprise better than the actual song ! sorry ! 12 . Angels Cry : 4/5 every1 seems 2 luv this song . The lyrics are sentimental and deep . maybe it will grow on me more.13 . Languishing : 4/5 this `` interlude '' almost lost me but there is some good vocals.14 . I Want 2 Know What Love Is : 5/5 Mariah does yet another cover of an 80 's power ballad . She does an amazing and unique version , changing up one of the lyrics `` In case I 'm needed when I 'm COLDER '' . In the Foreigner version it says `` In Case I 'm needed when I 'm OLDER '' .

Brown 's ` The Attic EP ' . I had heard of The Noisettes , but I 'd never really given them much attention . After devouring their latest album , ` Wild Young Hearts ' , I 'm ready to pounce all over ` What 's the Time Mr. Wolf'.Once I do , I 'll be sure to weigh in.Grabbing at influences that range from funk to pop to R & B ; and hip-hop , to jazz and punk and even flares of country ( Sometimes ) ; The Noisettes have a deep pool to choose from , and while their influences may crop up here and there in subtle flourishes , they are recognizable and admirable , for they add layers of uniqueness to this album . I 'm intrigued to get my hands on their debut album , for I have a feeling it may be even more diverse than this album ( correct me if I 'm wrong ) , and so I have this aching feeling I may even like that album more than I like this one.But serious , I am dying to hear their stoned out take on ` Hit Me Baby ( One More Time ) ' ! The album opens strong , with ` Wild Young Hearts ' setting the tone and pace of the album ( the funk throwback feel is the strongest influence on this album ) . I love the playfulness of the track . It lets you know right up front that this is a happy album . The band even made mention in interviews that this was an album about being young , no matter what you age , by the way you act ; enjoying your life and having fun . ` Wild Young Hearts ' is a beautiful way to introduce that morale . ` Do n't Upset The Rhythm ( Go Baby Go ) ' comes next , screaming 60 's and proving even more exciting and engaging than ` Wild Young Hearts'.Pure disco brilliance.The best track on the album , without any hesitation whatsoever , is ` Never Forget You ' . The sensual jazz undertones are brilliantly matched by lead singer Shingai Shoniwa 's flawless vocals . The way she slinks into the verses is just impeccably entrancing . The song is on constant replay in my i-pod and I do n't foresee a time when I 'll grow tired of it.I love the disco flare brought to ` Saturday Night ' , even if I find the way she actually says `` Saturday Night '' to be rather annoying . It 's still a great song with great character . Probably my second favorite track on the album is ` Atticus ' . It has a much softer and gentler flow to it , reminiscent of soft rock . Shingai 's vocals are just flawless here . I love the lyrics here , so deep and meaningful and provocative.Both ` Every Now and Then ' and '24 Hours ' are great examples of two shade of the band . ` Every Now and Then ' is a much more mellow track , feeling aged yet modernly refreshing . '24 Hours ' is much bouncier and evokes a more uplifting and happy atmosphere . They way they layer their approaches to musical genres is stunning to listen to . Both tracks obvious borrow from similar pools of influence , yet they allow each track to speak for itself.I absolutely ADORE ` Beat of My Heart ' . The song is just , well , STUNNING.I 'm less impressed with the albums closing tracks . I admire the bluesy take on ` Sometimes ' , which evokes a southern rock , country feel to it . It was a risky and commendable attempt , but for me it just does n't stand out as well as it could have . I love that these guys are not afraid to try new things and incorporate many genres in their own style ( although the funk/R & B ; tone is predominantly their forte ) . For me , the closing track ` Cheap Kicks ' is the worst song here . It 's not because it 's ` bad ' but because it 's uninspiring . It just does n't bring anything new or exciting to the album and does n't scream ` LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AGAIN ' . Vocally , amazing , but aside from that it 's forgettable.Overall I 'm very happy with this album . I 'd totally recommend it , and I thank Sealinewuman for giving me the heads up !"}, "22730": {"id": "22729", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "'Wild Young Hearts ' for me was definitely one of those surprising albums of the year - the type that come out of nowhere from a group that you really have n't heard of that turns out to be ten times better than anything that gets a tone of publicity and attention . If you are looking for an album that has some elements of rock and old school doo-wop , 'Wild Young Hearts ' is definitely for you . It 's hard to describe the group 's genre or vibe simply because by listening to the album , you can tell the music has been inspired by various artists and musical movements . The end product is an album that can get you moving and dancing , as with `` Do n't Upset the Rhythm '' , and music that is very moving and reflective and packed with emotion and sentiment , as with `` Cheap Kicks '' .The Good : The vocals performed by Shingai Shoniwa is definitely what gives 'Wild Young Hearts ' it 's flair and attitude . Her voice , unlike so many artists these days , is natural and not computerized or auto-tuned . The Noisettes exude uniqueness and individuality with their music relying on vocals left untouched and natural backed with actual instrumentals that give each song a very indie rock vibe as if you 're listening to this group in concert or in an intimate setting like a small club venue . I can tell that the group put time into actually developing the music and the lyrics . Basically , when you 're listening to 'Wild Young Hearts ' you feel the music is authentic and personal and that the Noisettes really put themselves into the music . The music itself reminded me a lot of doo-wop infused with pop and rock . If I had to compare them to anyone it would be Blondie ; the music has a very early 1980s punk rock vibe ; happy , whimsical , lyrics and a voice that 's unique and really pulls you in . There 's really no 'bad ' song on the release . The songs that work best for me are the dancefloor-inspired `` Do n't Upset the Rhythm '' and the reflective/moody tracks `` Atticus '' , `` Every Now and Then '' and `` Cheap Kicks '' .The Bad : 'Wild Young Hearts ' has been released overseas for a while now . With this U.S. release , the record company for whatever reason not only played with the sequencing of the tracks but removed a few from the import version of 'Wild Young Hearts ' . This version did include all of the tracks on the import version except for one , `` So Complicated '' , a track that really deserved to be on this version . Yes , it 's one track but it 's a great track and there 's really nothing like it or comparable to it on the release . It 's an upbeat , fast-paced track with lots of guitar and drum that is something like an upbeat ballad . The sequencing of the U.S. version is okay but makes me wonder who decided the original track line-up did n't work and why songs were flipped around . It 's a minor critique that makes me wonder if the record company was trying to compensate for the missing track that really moved things along on the first release.In all , the critiques are n't enough to keep this release from being something worth purchasing . 'Wild Young Hearts ' is a great release that is packed with emotion and good music . Yes , at times , the tracks suffer from sounding similar to one another but I believe it is because of the rare quality of having music that is n't all computer enhanced and is actually based on vocals and people playing real instruments , so it is forgivable .

Unlike Noisettes ' earlier releases , which emphasized the punk side of a punk-soul mix , Wild Young Hearts beats a path straight to Motown 's door , stopping to pick up a Blondie wig along the way . A little bit schizophrenic , but jumping with unbridled joy , Wild Young Hearts beats a disco rhythm one minute ( `` Do n't Upset the Rhythm '' ) and Bristol-like stomp ( `` Never Forget You '' ) the next .

The title track is another favourite of mine , but it is hard to highlight one track over another to be honest . The lead vocalist Shingai Shoniwa has a wonderful voice and lends the album a real jazzy feel without becoming clich & eacute ; d or cheesy and the songs on offer alternate between punchy upbeat numbers to more sultry , smouldering affairs .

I was so intrigued by what I was hearing because it hit so hard and came instantly as the freshest and most mesmerizing music that I 've heard in a long time . After I made a few phone calls , I was sent my very own copy and had it almost the next day . I 've been listening to this almost constantly . And be warned it 's so catchy , that you might think it a bit too catchy . I found myself hearing several songs in my head long after I had gone to bed . Unexplainably good.What 's probably the most obvious thing to say about this band / this record is that with the incredible amount of garbage floating around in the musical void they stand out so far that it 's almost embarrassing how good they are , and all while doing it in a simple and natural manner . It 's the first time I ever thought I 'd ever hear a perfect blend ofDiana RossandThe Sex Pistols . The sexual frustration on every track is almost palpable , too . So it 's no mistake Shingai sings : `` Damn this Wild Young Heart '' and it 's being fronted as the cover track.My favourite cuts on the album are just about all of them . You can listen to this from start to finish and never think of hitting the forward or back buttons . You may find yourself obsessing on anyone of the songs though , without doubt . ` Cheap Kicks ' and '24 Hours ' are my absolute favourites , even though the radio hits are brilliant all by themselves . I often have to censor my thoughts when I 'm listening to ` Do n't Upset The Rhythm ' as Shingai is honestly doing her best to seduce the listener.The best album I 've heard in a very long time and what 's even better is the fact that they 're incredible live - which is becoming more and more rare with some of these ` musical ' offerings as of late.And like Paul McCartney ... she plays bass ... ..."}, "22734": {"id": "22733", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It 's only fitting that Ledisi 's 2009 release contains four songs with the word `` change '' in the title . Because that 's exactly what this album represents . Having really made a splash in the music world with herLost & Founda couple years earlier it was clear the Oakland native was more than aware of not only the rich musical heritage of the bay area but her stronger sense of the groove . While it 's true she had no problem dealing with funk on her last album it was done in a jazzier , slinkier fashion . By bringing in the likes of Jam/Lewis and Rahpael Saadiq as producers/co-composers on this album it allowed her to explore the more gospel/soul elements of her sound . And , in this case that 's represented in many ways by funk.Ledisi herself opts for more of a tough , growling style of singing on this album . At the same time the jazzy level of control is still of primary importance . This album contains a heavy chuck of hardcore , rocking funk on `` Runnin '' , '' Knockin '' and a cover of Buddy Miles classic `` Them Changes '' . These take a similar approach to funk that Rufus did-somewhat from a rock n roll standpoint , with more of a crunch to the rhythm section . A good deal of the songs fit into the category of funky soul such as `` Love Never Changes '' , the title song , '' Trippin '' and `` The Answer Is Why '' . The most potent of these is `` Please Stay '' , which to some degree brings to mind the early 70 's Sly Stone style of wah-wah charged poppy funk . `` I Need Love '' with it 's heavy programmed orchestral synth sounds could 've been very generic . But with Ledisi 's gospel soul shouting and the cosmic melody it 's the perfect marriage of musical styling with modern instrumentation.Between that and more retro gospel/soul inspired `` Alone '' , '' Love Never Changes '' and `` Goin ' Through Changes '' this album really does a great job at show casing the tougher side of her musical virtues . All the same the kind of elegance she 'd always had on display beforehand . That kind of mixture of gospel intensity and jazzy elegance are part of the basis of funk to begin with . So the hard driving funky soul Ledisi goes for on this album really brings out the power of her voice and compositions as well . It 's pretty difficult for someone with her type of creative bent and outlook to be much of a sellout . And this album continued the pattern of success of the previous release . All the same the theme of change was an excellent way to anchor the music . Because Ledisi is one of those people who has little to no intention of being bound by any musical boundaries , either creative or commercial that might stand in her way . So there 's a lot to admire about this album and the way she handles her groove ."}, "22735": {"id": "22734", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This CD contains a diverse amount of music that a lot of more established artists could n't pull off or would even want to .

The cd is much more raw than her previous effort , while exploring Funk , Blues , Rock , Hip Hop , and R & B ... all with great results . Songs such as `` Everything Changes '' , `` Turn Me Loose '' , Them Changes '' , `` The Answer to Why '' , and `` Please Stay '' , all reflect the complexity and realness of the porject .

Ledisi is not a fly-by-night , one dimensional , half-baked talent . She is an artist who has put in time to learn her craft , comes from a place musically that allows her to explore various genres , and is a true live performer who ignites a stage just with the music alone ( no props needed ) .

They bring `` it '' ( their creative force ) to further enhance the musicianship of Ledisi . This project demonstrates that Ledisi is not just a Gospel , Jazz , R & B ; or Pop artist . In truth , she is a singer/song writer who encompasses all genres.Rather than singling out a particular favorite track of mine on this grade `` A '' CD , I will just close in saying I love the whole thing from its ' slamming start to its ' engaging finish ."}, "22738": {"id": "22737", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Ledisi was practically an unknown artist until her 2007 albumLost & Foundwas nominated for two Grammy awards ( Best New Artist , Best R & B ; Album ) . While she failed to win , the exposure certainly heightened her profile as an R & B ; singer . Calling Ledisi 's second 'high profile ' album 'anticipated ' might be a bit of an overstatement , particularly given this stagnant economy in the music business , but it is certainly big for the previously unknown singer . LOST & FOUND was a fine album by all means , though it was `` quieter '' than the funkierTurn Me Loose , which shows a more ignited , even more vocally viable Ledisi . With this electrifying combination , TURN ME LOOSE is easily one of the best R & B ; albums of 2009 , right up there with the likes Maxwell'sBLACKsummers'nightand most likely Whitney Houston 's forthcomingI Look to You.The album opens up with the brief , but funky `` Runnin ' '' in which Ledisi instantly shows off her pipes . The songwriting is solid as is the production - and instant difference and departure from LOST & FOUND . `` Everything Changes '' keeps up the pace , adding funky horns to the mix . The production is still funkier than anything appearing on LOST & FOUND , marking a departure and experimentation on Ledisi 's part . As always , the starlet sings rings around a number of her contemporaries . `` Turn Me Loose '' , the title track is one of the funkiest of the album , hearkening old school 1960s/70s soul , though not sounding like an anachronism ( aka an outdated throwback ) . Sure , `` Turn Me Loose '' would only do well on Adult R & B ; /Adult Contemporary radio as opposed to pop stations , but that certainly does n't downgrade the freshness or the grand quality of this track.As for `` Higher Than This '' , it is n't only adult R & B ; at its finest , it also lays well for the hip-hop circuit with slightly fresher , more contemporary production than say `` Turn Me Loose '' . No , it is n't the overt `` hip-hop '' that has pervaded radio ( I mean that respectfully of course ) , but it does sound more directed toward a slightly younger audience - particularly in comparison to say `` Alright '' from Lost & Found . Ledisi sings exceptionally here , giving one of her most poignant , strong performances of TURN ME LOOSE . `` Higher Than This '' is just a well written , R & B ; song . `` Alone '' proves to be as well written as everything else showcasing Ledisi 's prodigious pipes and more sound production work . `` Love Never Changes '' features a chord-progression the likes of an Al Green southern-styled soul tune . Again , it is another solid listen and nowhere near being filler.Despite the solidity of tunes like `` Alone '' or `` Love Never Changes '' and the soulful `` Stay '' that would 've been perfect on Solange'sSol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams , it is a track like the should-of-been-first-single `` Knockin ' '' that truly steals the show . I have never heard Ledisi quite as energized or as contemporary on this R & B-rocker . ; I think to myself as a music enthusiast , 'why would you choose the good , but `` been-there-done-that '' 'Goin ' Thru Changes ' over such a kick-butt track as `` Knockin ' ? The production is the best of the entire album , the background vocals during the refrain are an exceptional touch , and Ledisi sounds awesome . 5 star track , ladies and gentlemen . `` Say No '' may not be equal to the greatness of `` Knockin ' '' , but it lays as well as everything does for the most part on TURN ME LOOSE . `` Goin ' Thru Changes '' is good ( not diminishing it ) , though I think adult R & B ; fans have heard this type of song more than once , which takes away from it slightly . It was a good choice for a first single , but it is n't necessarily better than `` Alright '' or `` Think of You '' from LOST & FOUND . Furthermore , as mentioned earlier , I believe `` Knockin ' '' easily 'beasts ' a track like `` Goin ' Thru Changes '' . `` I Need Love '' finds Ledisi again over a more contemporary backdrop with swirling synths and `` big drums '' . Wisely , the drums do n't grow as big as say a Ryan Tedder production ( known for 'big ' drums ) where it might have sounded a bit ill-fitting with Ledisi . `` I Need Love '' is n't the best of TURN ME LOOSE , but it also is n't filler . `` Trippin ' '' similarly is n't the best of TURN ME LOOSE , but it is certainly interesting if nothing else . The production is placed somewhere between the contemporary and a throwback to classic soul . `` The Answer To Why '' returns Ledisi back to more adult-contemporary helmed R & B ; , supported by acoustic guitar and strings . Again , I do n't connect with `` The Answer To Why '' as much as the very best of the album , but I do think Ledisi sounds great . The album closes `` funkily '' with the fantastic `` Them Changes '' , which proves to be worth the wait . A track like `` Them Changes '' could have easily appeared on a Prince , Chaka Khan , or Aretha Franklin album.Overall , TURN ME LOOSE is a great album . There is very little to criticize . The biggest thing is that Ledisi is better when she is funky and allowed to show off her prodigious vocals . 4 stars ; I hope that Ledisi receives a Grammy nomination once again ."}, "22739": {"id": "22738", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Ledisi .

Ledisi separates herself from every other artist somehow because she 's original , but she 's so spectacular in her originality .

'' I loved that album and downloaded most of it onto my iPod and every time one of her tracks come on , I turn it up and vibe . Ledisi 's vocals always jump out at you , whether she 's singing a ballad or an up-tempo track . The clarity and pitch of her soprano are amazing . `` Turn Me Loose '' is another fine work by Ledisi . She was influenced by the genre of rock and roll as well as jazz and R & B . ; What I love about this album is the live instruments , the great lyrics and the intertwining of music genres . Most of the tracks are mid-tempo or up-tempo , but what 's a Ledisi album without the ballads ? Yes , there are a few . The title track is mid-tempo and she does a whole lot with her voice on this song . You can hear the vocal gymnastic from miles away . This song is saying , if you are n't in this relationship for the long run , just `` turn me loose '' now and stop wasting my precious time . `` I Need Love '' is another mid-tempo ; the title of the song tells you what the song is about in a nutshell . It 's a good moment on the album . `` Everything Changes '' and `` Goin ' Thru Changes '' are two of my favorite songs because of the profound lyrics , song arrangement and delivery.This is a great album .

Rex Rideout ( he did the lion 's share of `` Lost And Found '' ) ... yeah , this was going to be real mellow . Man , was I in for a surprise ! ! ! On her new album `` Turn Me Loose '' , I think it 's safe to say that she showed out on this one . She came in with the premise to funk . It 's like she went from Anita Baker to Chaka Khan in a split second . On the first track , she presents the song `` Runnin ' '' produced by Chief Xcel from Blackalicious- and it only gets better from there . Throughout the album , she ventures into that 70 's soul sound from the South- namely Memphis soul , the Muscle Shoals sound and the Al Green era with Willie Mitchell ( she 's from New Orleans , after all ) .

I actually put off buying this album for a couple of years because Secret Society left such a bad taste in my mouth , but I 'm glad I finally gave it a try , because it certainly seems like Europe is back on the right track here.I suppose the first thing to clear up is that Europe did not go back to their ` 80s `` hair metal '' roots here . Those days are long gone , and the band does n't seem interested in trying to recapture that sound , which is probably for the best . They 're not trying for a modern rock sound either . Maybe they got that out of their system on Secret Society . No , Last Look at Eden puts the band back on the path they started withStart From the Dark- smart , steady melodic rock with real heart and an obvious appreciation for bands like Rainbow and Thin Lizzy . And the songs are really good too . They 're not as overtly catchy as the old ` 80s and early ` 90s material , but they are very melodic and have a way of sinking in after a spin or two . `` New Love in Town , '' `` No Stone Unturned '' and the title track are great examples . John Norum 's guitar work is more sublime than showy here , and Joey Tempest has a strong , steady delivery that gives the songs some added heart and soul.As long as you do n't go into this album expecting anotherThe Final Countdown , Last Look at Eden is unlikely to disappoint serious Europe fans . It 's a very solid modern melodic rock album , and just what I had hoped to hear from the band after Secret Society.Edition Notes : Last Look at Eden comes in a fairly sturdy digipack and features a pair of live songs - `` Yesterday 's News '' and `` Wakeup Call '' - as bonus tracks ."}, "22748": {"id": "22747", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Indeed , there is little doubt IMHO that this is the best , the most complete and sumptuous slab of wattage Europe have unleashed since they reconvened . Start From the Dark had it 's moments but the rusty interplay was a bit obvious in that John Norums riffs and Joey Tempests vox seemed utterly disconnected on many numbers . Secret Society was a good album , no doubt about it . But this is a touch better . It hangs together much like Secret Society did but it has a certain X factor and I can understand why some people are giving this the full five star treatment.On this album Europe does a range of things right . The prelude sets the tone for the whole album , a nifty little intro number of the sort you may more normally expect from a power metal band . The title track itself is a sturdy hard rocker where all things gel nicely . Elsewhere we get some interesting keys/riff/vox interplay on tunes such as No Stone Unturned which at times seems like a song with some form of multiple personality disorder as the chorus swoops on a Tempest vocal hook while Norum warbles away in the background and Mic Micheali comes over all 70 's prog tinged during the lulls . Other noteworthy numbers are the funky U Devil U which personally I find a bit twee though it 's hard to argue with the amount of roll it gives you with your serving of rock.The production is n't as warm and traditional sounding as Secret Society but that 's not to say it 's not as good , just things seem more ... .. shiny here . The booklet comes with full lyrics and I was lucky enough to score the version with a couple of bonus tracks .

Aside from the pianos in `` Fire and the Thud '' and the organ sound in `` Pretty Visitors , '' they still sound like the same band.However , the recording style went through major changes . With help from co-producer Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age , the new album is drenched with dreamy echos and loud bass riffs from Nick O'Malley . Turner 's high-pitched voice was also toned down for a more down-to-earth tone.The resulting sound is an irresistable mix between the hazy echos from Marvin Gaye 's `` What 's Going On '' album and the aggressive punchiness of the indie punk group , Kasabian.Even though it does n't sound like it should work , the Monkeys make it work miraculously , in true artistic splendor . Matt Helders ' drums are more subdued in this album , but his staccato-heavy 4/4 rhythm transforms the rules for punk rock bands . Rather than rely on the typical Green Day-style speed punk rhythm , Helders litters his rhythm with drum rolls , tom tom thumping and cymbal smashing , making for a beat that sounds more or less like hip-hop beats on steroids.The band 's new , bass-oriented sound is even more infectious . Songs such as the hit single `` Crying Lightning '' sound like a dark '70s noir song , rich with probably the coolest bass riff of the year from O'Malley . Other songs , such as `` Dangerous Animals , '' are adrenaline-pumping tracks with a wicked bass line in the chorus.Most of all , Alex Turner 's poetic lyrics are unforgettable . There 's nothing cooler than hearing Turner sing `` Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste/You 'll have to slip away I am unhappy to say , behold is the crook in the hammock plays . '' It 's an infectious song that turns the slums into a bizarre world , featuring a tramp with a trampoline under his arm and barking alarm which `` waits , coiled 'till the corner is turned . `` Despite the heavy criticism of the band from other reviewers , this is definitely the Arctic Monkeys ' best album yet .

The band quickly released a follow-up album , 2007 's `` Favourite Worst Nightmare '' , which I thought was absolutely fantastic ( I had it in my Top 3 of the year ) , even though it was less commercially successful than the first album , both in the UK and here in the US . ( The closing track `` 505 '' will give you an idea of the new album , incidentally . ) The band toured relentlessly and then took its merry time to come back with new material .

The album stumbles out of the blocks with a tentative `` My Propeller '' , the weakest track on here , and I generally skip it to be honest .

The middle section of the album brings mostly slower , subdued songs . The band really finds its groove on this album towards the latter part , starting with `` Dance Little Liar '' , setting off a tense and great ending of the album . `` Pretty Visitors '' is one of the best tracks on here , and the 5+ min . closer `` The Jeweller 's Hands '' caps off the album nicely.If you are looking for a repeat of the first 2 albums , you will be sorely disappointed . This album is dense but it started to win me over after repeated listening . Arctic Monkeys have moved on , period . Deal with it . I find the comparison with Kings of Leon very telling . After KoL 's first two `` Southern Strokes '' albums , that band came back with an equally darker 3rd album `` Because of the Times '' , telling us the band was going different places ( and we now know to what that has lead , with their `` Only By the Night '' mega-smash album ) .

The bands both started out as hyper-adolescent punkier outfits , with their lyrical sights set on teen girls and gear ( Mars Bars to Nikes ) , and both sounded like a group that could have only formed in a British DiY environment . While their fans might have wanted the Monkeys to do songs like `` I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor '' forever , band leader Alex Turner appears to be tired of the form . So he minor-keys it , slows the pace down ( allowing drummer Matt Helders room to show off ) and allows his voice to flow like an instrument.That makes songs like `` Propeller '' sound almost menacing .

Backed by the smartly named campaign `` Do n't believe the hype '' they soared steadily and even though their follow-up was not as rotund in its offer as their debut their popularity did not dwindled a bit.For their third record they have enlisted QOTSA frontman Josh Homme and Last Shadow Puppets ' producer James Ford , both of who do not stain the Arctic Monkeys perspective but rather make it grow .

Ford 's touch shows in the detailed arrangements that had been previewed in his work with the Puppets.Singer Alex Turner sounds more mature , and that is a term that will stick in one 's head throughout this album as the band is obviously taking baby steps into new horizons , cautiously but with determination . Growing up is a reality they have decided to embrace musically and the results have sprung a surprising detour on their ascension road.Potion approaching and Cornerstone , two of the finest moments , are perfect examples of the new territories they explore : they are thinking sonically without abandoning the candid approach to lyrics .

After a series of studio experiments and endless writing sessions , they finally got around to producing the record themselves and thus `` The Resistance '' has arrived . Sprawling , beautiful and most importantly - musical - the album aims to be yet another classic , with the band accomplishing such lofty goals almost effortlessly.Like those before it , Muse 's fifth is swamped with heartfelt vocals , synthesizers , breath-taking piano playing and distorted base , all the elements that have come to be associated with the band by now . `` The Resistance , '' is n't much of a creative departure for the band , but is most certainly a more focused and sharper affair than 2006'sBlack Holes and Revelationswas . The album is highlighted by songs ranging from the epic `` United States of Eurasia '' to the arena-rock of `` Guiding Light , '' a stunning ballad that is sure to send shivers up your spine each and every time . On songs such as these , the guitar-work of Matthew Bellamy comes to the forefront and blazes a trail for the rest to follow . Each song packs a punch of over-whelming emotion and power . Think U2 , but without any pretentions or limitations.The coup de grce , however , comes in the album 's three-part `` Exogenesis Symphony , '' which closes out the album , marking perhaps Muse 's finest musical achievement to date . Employing over 40 musicians ( which is a staggering ratio to the three men that normally make up the band ) this weighty piece of music is both epic and ambitious , much like the eight songs that precede it . This piece may take up a good chunk of space , but it also goes a long way in capping off a breath-taking and boundary pushing album . Success and the growing expectations from the band 's audience have done little to spoil the band 's creativity , and in turn , Muse has yielded yet another rich and robust affair . `` The Resistance '' is , without a doubt , destined to become a modern classic ."}, "22783": {"id": "22782", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "You just ca n't please some `` fans '' .

Sure , when I listen to this I hear Radiohead , Queen , Porcupine Tree or some combination there of , but I still can recognize it as MUSE .

And the complete absence of Autotune from a single song on this CD was the most beautiful thing I 'd heard in quite some time . Because come on people , seriously . Do we want to sing or sound like Daleks ? Back on topic though , I love every song on this CD , but my favorites are the three openers , Uprising , The Resistance and Undisclosed Desires ."}, "22785": {"id": "22784", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Muse just barely disappointed me with Black Holes and Revelations , an album critically acclaimed to be their crowning achievement that I found slightly uneven . I 've never thought twice about naming Absolution as my favorite album by the band , and as a follow-up , Black Holes just seemed to be lacking the same focus and drive . This left room for The Resistance to come in and reclaim what I felt they had lost . In a way , it does . Resistance takes the best moments from each album and tries to put its own unique spin on them . The result is far more hit and miss than Black Holes could have ever dreamt of being , yet still a somewhat rewarding experience for any Muse fan.What Muse does exceedingly well on The Resistance is the same thing they 've always done ; craft loud , smart , beautigul rock music . `` Uprising '' feels like a Muse take on a Marilyn Manson song - at least initially . By the time the third chorus rolls around , you 'll most likely be rocking out to the harmonies and Muse-peggios that you 've grown accustomed to over the years . As far as pure , unadulterated rock goes though , you 'd be hard-pressed to find anything on this album more satisfying than `` United States of Eurasia . '' The song is so pretty , yet so raw and real that you 'll think you were listening to Queen . When Matt screams out , `` United States ! United States ! '' I get goosebumps at the sheer awesomeness of it all . This is classic Muse ; something that any long-time fan can instantly fall in love with.But as I said , The Resistance is a highly uneven listen , and where songs like `` Eurasia '' will rock your junk clean off , others like `` Guiding Light '' fall absolutely flat . It 's this album 's `` Invincible '' - really good until you start to see all the flaws in it . `` Undisclosed Desires '' is Muse 's completely misguided attempt at making a Britney Spears song , which may pander to the `` Twilight '' crowd ( I ca n't even begin to tell you how much it annoys me when people describe `` Supermassive Black Hole '' as `` that song from Twilight ) , but it has absolutely no place on this album ! In all fairness , it seems like they 're trying to recreate that same song right down to the lyrical content . But where `` Supermassive '' had an irresistible rock groove to it , this one is simply boring . As far as the poppier Muse is concerned , I 'll be just fine with `` I Belong to You , '' easily one of the album 's finest tracks . It 's got a danceable beat and an infectious feel . The French interlude is strikingly beautiful , and when everything comes back together again , well , it 's just magic ! A review of The Resistance would n't be complete without mentioning the 3-part `` symphony '' that closes out the album . `` Exogenesis '' is straight from the Absolution-era of Muse , and for that reason , I ca n't help but love it ! `` Overture '' sounds like a roided-out version of `` Ruled by Secrecy , '' the eerie closer to the band 's 2003 masterpiece , `` Cross-Pollination '' is straight out of `` Butterflies and Hurricanes , '' while `` Redemption '' sort of just stands on its own merits . As great as these songs are though , they feel entirely tacked-on to the album , which takes away from their greatness a bit.The biggest flaw of The Resistance in my opinion is the lyrical content . Matt Bellamy has seemed compelled to write socio-political songs as of late , so seeing it appear all over the album is no big surprise . But Muse 's music alone has always made me want to go take on the whole world . Writing a song about how we need to rebel against the powers that be and `` watch our flag ascend '' just seems like a dumbing-down of the music . Popular music has always been an outlet for speaking out against governments and `` fat cats , '' but Dylan did it much better in the 60s . Bellamy 's lyrics come off as a Saturday-morning cartoons version of the same thing.Still , there 's a lot to like about The Resistance . There are some fantastic songs on this album , and if you can get over the 3 or 4 dud tracks and the sometimes-silly lyrical content ( `` Love is our resistance ? '' Dear god , really ? ! ? ) , you 'll find that it is an entirely worthy album to add to your collection . Yes , Muse is officially an `` arena '' band , but they 're endlessly more talented than any of the other bands occupying the sub-genre . Take solace in that , and in knowing that in the last 10 years they have yet to let any of us down entirely.Key Tracks:1 . `` Uprising '' 2 . `` Resistance '' 3 . `` United States of Eurasia '' 4 . `` I Belong to You '' 5 . `` Exogenesis : Symphony Pt . 1 : Overture '' 7 out of 10 Stars"}, "22786": {"id": "22785", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Okay where to begin , it has been three years since we got a taste of Muse and there brilliantly artsy and layered tunes . Since their last release `` Black Holes and Revelations '' Muse have really bloomed into a group capable of much more then a mere Radiohead clone . They 've also procured their rights into the mainstream of rock and alternative , being plastered on award ceremonies , tracks hitting the ` Guitar Hero ' and ` Rockband ' series , just overall awareness seems to have spiked.Muse have stated time and time again `` The Resistance '' ( though at the time untitled ) would be more of an experimental/electronic effort . Rest assure they did n't pull a Radiohead `` Kid A '' minimalist approach ( again avoiding similarities between the two groups ) , but instead putting fourth all the right efforts to make for an epic . 11 tracks , about 55 minutes of music , and a three part conceptual movement , Muse are back ! Album openers deceptive tracks leading us to believe it is X when it is really A , `` Uprising '' is our opening to `` The Resistance '' . For a single it 's a tad bit long and maybe a bit too repetitive , but it hits clearly with electronic beats capable of raising a New Order fan back from the club . Reminds me a bit beat wise of a song from Battles with out the math rock complexity of course , . Now the actual title track `` Resistance '' ( in this case track 2 ) is of the opposite polarity to that of `` The Resistance '' . Both on the same playing field as they both are electronic , but this ones less charged and more passive especially the ambience of the intro . Then the familiarity of a U2 track you may know of as `` New Years Eve '' is drawn , the pianos watery reverberation and path along the keys may make you think twice on the bands influences . The third track is less then 4 minutes and is tied as the shortest song on the album along side with part two of the concept tied tracks . `` Undisclosed Desires '' plays out to be a tightly chopped tune that sounds as though it 'll be a sleeper single . It 's not bad , nor am I saying it is a single , it is one of those tracks that have the right hooks to make it accessible , but lack the oomph to be the first single . `` United States of Eurasia '' is a track Muse just do n't seem to let die , each album they have a soft crooning piano tune and keep making a song that could be its counterpart ... ` USoE ' is that one . To keep things a little more interesting they throw in a Queen like surge into the mix and weave it with a foreign group of scales . Speaking of reinventions `` Guiding Light '' ( track 5 ) sounds very similar to `` Invincible '' one of Black holes cheerier moments ( as it was pretty bleak ) . Minus the slivering guitar of `` Invincible '' add a loudness boost to the drums equals `` Guiding Light '' in a nutshell . `` Unnatural Selection '' track 6 is a shape shifter at that . Goes from an organ intro to a Deep Purple meets Queens of the Stone Age big muff tune . It is also the longest track on the album docking in at nearly 7 minutes ! `` MK Ultra '' ( not Radioheads MK1 & 2 ) is though the synthesized strings were rolled in sugar . It is poppy , pounces , and has quick game like change ups ( one part reminded me of something from the older Legend of Zelda video game series ) . `` I Belong To You '' did n't get the memo , a song like this already exists on the album elsewhere and at an earlier point ! This track would be `` Undisclosed Desires '' , they both have that one-two combo in the beginning this track has a bit more dynamics and is less buzzed out . The existence of this track is probably for the vocal chord dance in around the half way point deterring it from `` Undisclosed Desires '' to make it its own entity . The brassy connection around the 4:40 mark is of interest too.Now onto the three part mini epic sweeps , being strung on a line or playing around with the continuity of the album wont really hurt these three tracks . I feel they are all interchangeable and can give some power back to certain songs after coming off the high of such profound delicacy . The reason I say not to worry so much about the continuity here of all places is , although they are all similarly named ( `` Exogenesis '' ) ... The three tracks tie in together by a quick fading out . grabbing a hold that fade and phasing it into the intro of the next track . They are all orchestral though , especially the second part `` Cross-Pollination '' . It has a breakout moment and then shoots back down to a low volume resonating bow . The first Exogenesis `` Overture '' is just that , movie like , finds a stair climbing pace and walks with it indefinitely . The third and final Exogenesis is one of a supposed catharsis entitled `` Redemption '' . Intro wise it sounds a bit mournful but seems to find the swinging light overhead , and ends on a brighter note piano slowing down , notes ringing a little bit longer growing a bit more sleepy and there you have reached the end.So what did we get here with the long awaited new Muse album ? You be the judge of that , I 'll tell you what I got out of it . A band that has succeeded with another hit album yearning for a more complex passive side , while still submissively pleasing the crowds near flawlessly . It achieves what is was suppose to an eclectic electronic album , its short comings are simple and literally short at that . Maybe a expenditure to the total duration by shaving down minutes off a few other songs , keep the intensity of the first track , and that 's really about it . It 's not a step above there four previous albums and they are n't leaps above this . This one wont be a sleeper hit due to there fame at this point , but maybe when looked back at Muse 's catalog one might spot this one with some of weakest moments . If not that maybe the best word is least desirable.So do we get our moneys worth ? Simple answer yes , the budget price is quite the deal and the deluxe edition is about that of standard CDs anyways . Those not familiar with Muse and would to get into them will also find it helpful that the band has had there work all reissued on vinyl ! Final question probably looming from above is ... Was it worth the wait ? Yes , be glad Muse are back , be glad no hiatus came our way ."}, "22787": {"id": "22786", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 'd like to weigh in on this before overexposure utterly ruins this fine CD for me . It should come as no surprise that as muse grows in popularity their music becomes more mainstream . That is a hard and fast truth that has repeatedly been proven correct throughout the history of popular music . The pop radio sheen has been polished brightly for this record . THE RESISTANCE is not like SHOWBIZ or SYMETRY , two earlier recordings that typified their youth and exuberance whereby the song 's inherent energy trumped production . But even then they appeared to possess a grander vision of where they 're headed . Their penchant for a larger-than-life sound , and anthemic showstopper mentality was apparent as young up-and-comers . Given the breakthrough of ABSOLUTION and the overwhelming success of BLACK HOLES it 's only natural that this album would continue in that path toward US stardom . Consequently , it 's at this point in the progression that I usually lose interest in a given artist . But I could n't resist . What works for this band since the beginning is a combination platter of loud , razor-sharp guitars , obtuse lyrics , rich , layered vocal harmonies and classically-infused ( nocturne-like ) piano passages . The latter are also the components that many detractors obsess upon . Is n't it curious that those who routinely resort to tired old cliches like self-indulgent , bombastic and pretentious when criticizing progressive and art rock are themselves guilty of self-indulgence , pretension and verbosity in their own writing and ( more insidiously ) in their thought process ? They know better than the unwashed , uncultured masses.This is simply another superbly artful endeavor by muse . Matthew Bellamy 's ambiguous writing and showy playing is at the core of this band . He has endured the unjustifiable accustations of being a Thom Yorke ripoff , which have finally been silenced . Now it 's Freddie Mercury and Brian May that he 's beholden to . Well , he 's certainly not the first artist to dare reveal his influences . It 's that melting pot of experience , talent and influences that yield the most meaningful , enduring and controversial art.I fully realize that this is the record that launches muse to new heights but since I do n't listen to radio for music purposes I pray that I am at least partially insulated from the unfettered hype that is sure to ensue ."}, "22788": {"id": "22787", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Listening to `` The Resistance '' is exploring a world on the brink -- war , controlling governments , and a brewing revolution thinking about rising up . Those dark and conflictive sentiments boil slowly through Muse 's fifth full-length album , which is equal parts brilliant and awkward . While many of the songs are exquisite and expansive , the whole synthy Depeche Mode vibe just does n't work . `` The paranoia is in bloom/the PR , the transmissions will resume/They 'll try to push drugs to keep us all dumbed down/And hope that we will never see the truth around , '' Matthew Bellamy sings over a stabbing bass melody and colorful swathes of electronica.That more or less sets the mood for the songs that follow , although they tend to be a bit more restrained -- the slow piano-and-drums build of `` Resistance '' blooms into a hard-rock explosion . Then there 's some dancy synth-riddled melodies ( I smell MTV ) , slow-burning stretches of bass-blazing prog , and hundred-mile-an-hour avalanches of volcanic hard-rock ( `` I 'm hungry for some unrest/I wan na push it beyond the peaceful protest ! '' ) . Not to mention the truly brilliant , multifaceted expanse of `` United States of Eurasia . `` The last third is basically one big climactic build-up , followed by a spectacular musical finale -- it 's like sitting through a good-but-not-great movie , and then being blown away by the final act . After the symphonic piano-rock of `` I Belong To You ( + Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix ) , '' Muse begins a spectacular three-part `` Exogenesis : Symphony '' that harkens back to their older work , with string instrumentation blending seamlessly with the exquisitely painful , rich Britrock.I 've adored everything that Muse has ever produced , even the albums that did n't quite rise to their full potential , but `` The Resistance '' strays too far from their signature sound to be truly engaging . It still has some rich rock songs that blaze with internal fire on their own , but do n't really stick together into a cohesive album.The first few songs of `` The Resistance '' are rather awkward , with lots of fuzzy hard-rock , buzzing bass and a glitzy synth sound -- and some like `` Undisclosed Desires '' is the stuff of art-rock nightmares . You keep expecting Britney Spears ' robotic voice to chime in.But gradually the classical and hard-rock influences start to blend more seamlessly , and you end up being swept away by the lush expansiveness of `` United States of Eurasia '' or the aching `` Unnatural Selection . `` There 's also a hefty dose of buzzing bass guitar and multicolored synth , mingled in over the epic stretches of guitar , symphonic strings , and some piano buildups that add a melancholy edge to all the angular rock'n'roll stuff.And Bellamy sticks to the tried-and-true messages in his songwriting -- the world is in turmoil ( `` And these wars ; they can never be won/does anyone know or care how they 've begun ? `` ) , governments are rotten and the world is a mess , so get off your butt and act . Much of the time , he sounds like he 's standing on a cliff raging against a storm.As much as it pains me to say it , `` The Resistance '' failed to grasp my mind and heart like the previous Muse albums .

Classic `` political , media & social brainwash '' -bashing rock music . Despite having a `` theme '' , the songs are very diverse , ranging from high energy power rock , to quiet , delicate and precise piano passages .

There is a lot of discussion how The Resistance is a different sound for Muse but after a half dozen listens , I find it as more of an evolution or maturation of a sound that started with Black Holes and Revelations . The Resistance feels like it could feel the same mold , but lyrically it is well advanced beyond that.The album find Muse taking a more serious approach to their music with political themes that can be seen as targeting the current world state of affairs . Yet , as a Muse album , one can still see the side that throws fun , over-the-top music and style into its songs . This is probably best illustrated by the song `` The United States of Eurasia '' . There is an underlying political message that is masked by the fun of the sound that is strangely similar to Queen in Bohemian Rhapsody.In fact , you find a similar condition in each song on the album , and it really makes this album stand apart rather than amongst or behind others that tackle serious themes . Too often , albums blatantly state the criticism of politics or current events like a war , but the best music does n't need to state the obvious . In fact , an enduring piece of music will leave it just a bit vague as that is the type of music that will be relevant in years to come when similar wars or political situations develop . A subtle message is wonderful , and it is what really makes this Muse album grand.The only knock I give on this album is that the sound has n't really evolved enough from Black Holes and Revelations to really make this album stand apart from its predecessor . Lyrically , it does , and there are some great elements to the music such as the 3 part symphony at the end and the piano interludes Matthew Belamy throws in here and there , but there were similar elements in the previous album . However , I do find that the unity of the album as a whole and the layers of sound keep growing on me , and in a few weeks time , I may actually think this is Muse 's masterpiece.In the end , I think that if you are a fan of Black Holes and Revelations , you 'll love the Resistance . If you are a fan of albums previous to that , you still might enjoy it . Lyrically the Resistance is a step up and in a similar vein with Absolution , but if you are a fan of those earlier albums , you just might not find it reaching that level in your ear . Then again , if you are a listener that likes a challenge , you 'll probably find it a joy to listen to after a few tries whether or not you think it is Muse 's masterpiece ."}, "22791": {"id": "22790", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "With sounds akin to Radiohead , Queen and Fredric Chopin ; this album is a sublime masterpiece . Undeniably brilliant and aurally arresting . The Exogenisis symphony is elegant and worth the whole price of admission ."}, "22792": {"id": "22791", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "In my high school days -- when I was into bands like Creed and Good Charlotte -- I would automatically write off bands like Muse because they reminded me too much of Radiohead , who I hated.Nowadays , thank goodness , my ways and tastes have changed.Muse is a perfect example of a modern rock band that consistently cranks out solid albums and even more solid live shows . I 've had the privilege of seeing them live twice now and both times rank right up there some of the best concerts I 've ever seen -- and , all bragging truly aside , I 've been to many a concert in my day.This most recent tour is in support of their latest album , 2009 's `` The Resistance '' ( more on that later ) .While this album does n't represent the band 's pinnacle ( 2003 's `` Absolution '' holds that spot for me ) , it is a uniquely engaging and entertaining album and it definitely made my list of the best of 2009 . `` The Resistance '' is Muse 's fifth studio album and while all of their previous albums were self-produced along with help from other production collaborators , this album is their first with sole control . And rightly so , for such an epic and ambitious undertaking as this album has proven to be , it could only have come from the minds and interpretations of the band members themselves ( mostly lead singer/guitarist/primary songwriter Matthew Bellamy ) .I love to see bands evolve over time . Even if they evolve in what the majority of people agree to be the `` wrong direction '' , at least it shows that they 're willing to try something different . Even though I do n't consider `` The Resistance '' to be Muse 's best album I have to give them credit for still exhibiting elements of that stadium rock sound we all know and love ( see the Queen-esque `` United States of Eurasia '' ) but at the same time exhibiting a new and exciting evolution.As far as this idea of evolution goes , it really shows through in that this album explores the electronic and classical genres a great deal more than any of Muse 's previous releases.A perfect example of the electronic side of things would be the song `` Undisclosed Desires '' . Even though it 's mostly electronic in terms of drum beats and bass lines , it also has symphonic elements sort of soaring over the top of everything else that 's going on in the song.In terms of classical elements , the best example of this would be the albums three part closer , `` The Exogenesis Symphony '' . I 'm a huge sucker for things like this . I love multi-part songs/titles that are epic , tell a great story , and last for minutes on end ( this creation clocks in at 12:51 total ) . It is presented in three movements , `` Overture '' , `` Cross Pollination '' , and `` Redemption '' . All of the string arrangements and compositions were done by Bellamy himself and the work explores the theme of the end of humanity ( `` Overture '' ) , our attempts at survival ( `` Cross Pollination '' ) , and our realization that unless we drastically change something about the way we live , everything that has happened will only happen over and over again ( `` Redemption '' ) .Each of the three members of this band ( the aforementioned Bellamy , bassist Christopher Wolstenholme , and drummer Dominic Howard ) have always brought the heat in terms of stylistically identifiable parts on their various instruments ( most notably Wolstenholme 's bass part for the song `` Hysteria '' from the `` Absolution '' release ) and all of those elements are definitely present on this album . That fact , coupled with the fact that this studio effort really explores new territory makes `` The Resistance '' a truly enjoyable experience that , if nothing else , begs to have some sort of science fiction movie made that is based solely on its music -- or at the very least , `` The Exogenesis Symphony '' .One of my determining factors for how good I think an album is would be how well the songs seem like they would translate in a live setting . In this situation I was lucky enough to have been able to see firsthand whether or not this was the case . To put it quite simply , and I know this sounds clich & eacute ; ; words really ca n't describe it . Basically , if you ever get the chance to see Muse live , do yourself a favor and spend the money . It 's a guaranteed non-disappointment.Even though the songs compiling this album only earn it a four star review , the way they translate live coupled with older classics easily bump the concert experience to a full five stars . A conspiracy theorist might even think that it 's all a ploy to get people to the live shows since that 's where the real money seems to lie in the music industry these days ... The tour in support of `` The Resistance '' was Muse 's biggest yet . The stage setup alone cost over $ 2 million ( check out a picture here [ ... ] . The stage was centered around three mock skyscrapers which at the beginning of the show dropped down to reveal each of the three band members on his own riser probably around fifteen feet in the air . Of course , there was a rotating drum kit -- something with which ( as a drummer myself ) you can never go wrong . Their laser show was superb and at one point giant confetti-filled balloons that looked like eyeballs were unleashed on the crowd . Some concerts are emotional , some are even disturbing , but Muse puts on a show that is intense and just plain fun.The experience , like any , is one that can easily turn magical , especially if you have a loved one who has a mutual appreciation who can share it with you . I was blessed enough to have this so it made the night that much more enjoyable . One of the most beautiful things about music in general is that every time you buy an album , if it turns out to be one that you really enjoy there 's an excitement and anticipation that , `` Maybe someday I 'll get the chance to hear these songs in person . `` My hope for music lovers is that no matter which artists or bands you love that you 'll get a chance to see them in person at some point because it has the potential to cement them into the hall of fame of the things you truly loved most about this life ."}, "22793": {"id": "22792", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I had to jump on here and give `` The Resistance '' a 5 star review .

Muse 's fourth album , Black Holes and Revelations , was their first attempt at breaking the molds created by bands like Radiohead and Queen that they are so frequently compared to . Now , three years later , instead of moving onward in their own musical direction and establishing their own unique sound among the arena rock greats , they awkwardly climb back on the shoulders of their idols for support.There is no greater example of Muse 's static connection to the styles of other acts than in the song `` United States of Eurasia . '' The song starts out beautifully with the lyrics `` you and me are the same '' accompanied by piano . Perhaps these lyrics are a foreshadowing of things to come because at approximately one minute and eighteen seconds in , a vocal harmonization enters that is so similar to Queen that even Vanilla Ice would question its origin.Another area where Muse seems to have taken a step back is in the flow between songs on the album . Unlike many artists that release an album more as a collection of singles , Muse albums tend to have an excellent balance between songs giving the listener the sense that each song is a movement within a greater body of work . Unlike Black Holes and Revelations , which played like a symphony , the tempo changes and mood swings between songs on The Resistance are distracting at times . I ca n't imagine how confused a crowd would be if Muse ever tried to play The Resistance straight through in a live setting ; jumping around from the start with `` Uprising '' and then suddenly forced into a lull with the beginning of the appropriately named title track , `` The Resistance . `` Criticisms aside , The Resistance is still an enjoyable record and a must own for any fan of Muse 's previous efforts . The three part `` Exogenesis Symphony '' found at the end of the album is a beautiful bridge between the classical and electronic synthesis worlds . In the first movement , the strings even simulate the work of an arpeggiator , a tool frequently used by Muse in the past . As a true fan of their music from the beginning , I would have liked to have seen Muse really explore their own unique sound with their fifth trip to the studio , but Matthew Bellamy and company have still produced a final product that will undoubtedly solidify their reputation as one of the world 's greatest bands to see live .

I ca n't think of any groups that have the mix of synth elements , driving bass , and falsetto vocals that make up their identity , but it does n't quite sound new anymore . Also , Matthew Bellamy 's guitar playing is totally restrained here , which is not a good thing at all . `` Uprising '' , `` Resistance '' , and `` MK Ultra '' sound like normal singles for the band ; catchy , epic , and occasionally a bit silly . A couple tracks incorporate excerpts from classical music and operas , which is a bit pretentious , but does n't really hurt them . `` Guiding Light '' is the epitome of sounding like they 've done this all before .

In the year before , I had bought all four studio albums and HAARP ; I had high expectations and had become a die-hard fan . As an album , The Resistance is very coherent , but a lot less heavier than some of their other work ( i.e. , Origin of Symmetry , or Absolution ) .Track by track : Uprising- great opener but why the heck is this the single ? Do n't get me wrong , this is a great song but there are others that would do much better as singles.Resistance- Beautiful . This is one of the two songs that should have been a single . The the last couple seconds remind me of Star Wars : the phantom menace , although I do n't know why . The parts with the piano sound a little bit like ( VERY little , just the echo in the background ) X & Y ; era Coldplay . Drummers may want to hear this one.Undisclosed Desires- My opinion fluctuates here . The only thing that is definite is that anyone learning to play slap bass should download this , or have a liking for dance music . It is extremely electronic , and has no guitar or piano.United States of Eurasia- One of the greatest songs ever written by Muse . This is the other song that should have been a single . I think that it is very misplaced being in the middle here . Collateral Damage , is actually an excerpt from Frederic Chopin 's Nocturne in E-flat major . If you listen to this , you will hear some parts that sound like we are the champions . You can not go wrong if you download this song . It is amazing , beautiful , and very anthem like.Guiding Light- OK song . Not meant to follow Eurasia . If you are a fan of heavy distortion however , try this out.Unnatural Selection- Heavy , but definitely worth your time . When I first heard it , I thought it sounded it familiar but I did not realize that the main riff sounds a lot like Newborn , from origin of symmetry . Just as epic . That being said , it is another one of the albums highlights . It is varied , even though it may sound like heavy riffing at first , however there are dynamics and tempo changes . It is long.MK Ultra- Reminds me a little bit of Take A Bow , and Stockholm Syndrome . This would be more appreciated maybe if it followed Uprising . If Unnatural Selection is too long for you , then give this one a try . They 're in the same vein , only this does n't have as noticeably drastic tempo changes , however it makes up for that with having a much darker , dire sound . But what the heck is with the title ? I Belong To You ( +Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix ) - Interesting . It sounds a little like Muse attempted to mix classical , Jazz , and light rock . First off , a decent portion of this song is from the opera `` Samson and Delilah , '' which provides some nice contrast . Based on the part written by Muse , it sort of sounds like an angry love song , with a clarinet solo . The excerpt sounds like it is classical mixed with Jazz influences . Provides a lot of contrast , and is a good prelude to Exogenesis . The other half of the title is in French , and means `` My Heart Opens to Your Voice '' . For those who want something different from Muse.ExogenesisOverture- Brilliant . Although technically speaking , this is not an overture . An overture samples all of the songs in piece . This is more like the first movement of a classical piece . Now as a piece , it is absolutely GLORIOUS . Do n't expect heavy bass or drums . This is all about the vocals , and the strings . It sounds like a prelude to a fight scene , or a dark journey.Absolutely majestic.Cross-Pollination- The first thing I thought as it started , was Pink Floyd 's Ummagumma ; specifically , sysyphus . This is the part of Exogenesis that sounds the least like a symphony . Not as good as the overture , but decent.Redemption- This being a `` symphony , '' here is the final movement . An excellent way to close the album , only rivaled by Eurasia . The beginning could make someone cry , and it is quite literally , the piece one might hear during the final scene of a movie . Worth the downloadThat being said , Exogenesis is absolutely amazing as a whole . And if you get the CD you can read the lyrics , which are very much like a musical conversation.Also , if you consider getting the DVD Bonus version , it is literally showing what they did . There are no interviews , you are just watching fragments of recording sessions .

The production is solid , the songwriting exceptional , and frontman 's Matthew Bellamy 's vocal performance is spot-on .

It showcases the versatility of the group and their finesse . `` United States Of Eurasia/Collateral Damage '' reminisces one of something that Queen might have done in the 1970s . Progressive , beautiful , and epic , `` United States of Eurasia ...

Exceptional by all means , `` United States of Eurasia/Collateral Damage '' is a stand-out ( not to mention the use of classical composer/pianist Chopin at the end ! ! ! ) . `` Guiding Light '' begins energetically with a driving groove , that erupts into an epic , high energy cut . Inspirational , gargantuan , and chilling all in one , `` Guiding Light '' keeps up the momentum . `` Unnatural Selection '' opens with chilling pipe organ ( who does that on a rock album ? ) , leading into another 'sick ' performance . May I just say again , Grammy ? `` Unnatural Selection '' proves to be 7 minutes of unrequited greatness .

Undisclosed Desires is brilliant , a way different Muse song , and deifinitely a great different track for the British art rock trio . Guiding Light is a very Queen-esque song that I LOVE ! It definitely has a very `` A Night at the Opera '' sound to it . Unnatural Selection is one helluva catchy song , one that is definitely a must-play-over-and-over type track . I Belong To You is a very catchy , White Albumesque track that may take a little getting used to , but I love it . The last three tracks , however , are the best : The Symphony tracks are one epic experience when listened to together.Anyways , the special edition of the album comes with a DVD that has a 45 minute documentary on the making of the album . It 's quite fun to watch , as it has a lot of moments of the band goofing off . And it 's done in chronological order , so therefore it 's in the order of the songs . That said , the only thing I do n't like is the menu seriously thinks it 's a video game.Anyways , this is a great album , do NOT side with the negative reviewers before listening to it . Just listen to it yourself and judge . I ca n't wait to see them live on this tour now !"}, "22811": {"id": "22810", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Only a few tracks in and it 's clear that British rockers Muse had a lot invested in `` The Resistance . `` The tremulous yet genuinely seductive `` Undisclosed Desires '' gives off a smooth , meditative vibe that smolders and lingers . So too does the awesome title track until the killer chorus kicks in with a refreshing torrent of electric guitars and soulful , push-all-the-buttons vocals from lead singer Matthew Bellamy . The raw , angst-ridden lead single `` Uprising '' is a solid track in spite of some trite , undercooked lyrics.Because high-quality playing is standard throughout the album , sometimes shadowing the melodies and Bellamy 's expressive , longing vocals , some of the songs toward the center of the disc initially fade together . Increased , closer listens reveal the tracks ' individual assets , however . The hard-rocking , soul-searching bravado of `` MK Ultra '' is a major highlight , as is `` Guiding Light , '' which finds Bellamy in cloying but endearing voice . The latter could be a major radio hit with its juicy , evocative melody and room-to-breathe arrangement and downright awesome guitar solo.The mostly instrumental three-song suite that closes the album invites accusations of self-indulgence , but Muse score major points with each , particularly the third , which brings the album to a graceful , ambient , achingly beautiful close before one final outburst of thundering drums and powerhouse vocals . `` The Resistance '' is a hell of a recording from a hell of a band . It goes for the throat a little too earnestly and tries to impress a little too much , but with a set of musicians with what is clearly above-average talent the results inevitably remain a pleasure ."}, "22812": {"id": "22811", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This was my favorite Muse CD for a long time . It might be more suited for pop listeners ( I was pretty mainstream until i discovered Muse and followed them into the realm of alternative rock ) .

For example , `` Uprising '' makes you think of the importance of why it is better for people to be more united when it comes to standing up to their government . The video to the song really gives it more dimension . It is really weird but creative at the same time because of the teddy bears utilized in the video that are making some angry faces . I was intrigued to watch the video to understand the song some more , and also because `` Uprising '' is my husband 's favorite song . My favorite part of the `` Uprising '' song is where the Muse Frontman Matt Bellamy sings `` If You Could Flick a Switch , and Open Your Third Eye , You 'd See that We Should Never Be Afraid to Die '' . The reason why I enjoy that part of the song is because it symbolizes to me the importance of seizing opportunities in life even if you intend to joyfully live a long life . I believe the song `` Resistance '' is about how what is wrong or right in love is shaped by whoever is perceiving it ( depending on the person ) . My personal favorite song of this album is `` Undisclosed Desires '' song . It has a very original beat , and very romantic lyrics . `` Undisclosed Desires '' is a song that many are going to enjoy regardless of one 's romantic level . `` Undisclosed Desires '' is a beautiful message about someone that wants to have a passionate affair with someone regardless of what may have transpired in that individual 's past . It is suprising to me that the `` Undisclosed Desires '' has yet to see radio airplay where I live because it is very enjoyable . Overall , this collection is going to appeal to many who enjoy pop and/or rock music ."}, "22814": {"id": "22813", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Muse is a band that I have really grown to enjoy and just the fact that a band like this has become so popular gives me faith that at least some people out there still appreciate quality music . Muse fuses progressive rock with electronica , pop , and Queen like bombast to create a wall of sound approach that could easily be overblown and pompous , but in their capable hands becomes modern rock at it 's absolute best . The band have become a bit more commercial with each release , but it is a natural progression that is not as distracting as it often is with bands reaching this level of success . The album begins with two instantly catchy singles `` Uprising '' and `` The Resistance '' both of which deserve the massive airplay that they have received . Other highlights include the Queen influenced `` United States Of Eurasia '' and especially the final closing suite `` Exogenesis Symphony Parts 1 - 3 '' which features Muse at their progressive best . There are a few clunkers on the album which keep me from rating it a 5 star . `` Guiding Light '' , `` MK Ultra '' and `` I Belong To You '' sound like deliberate attempts at commerciality and do n't do a lot for me . From a progressive rock standpoint Muse are not nearly as complicated as many of their lesser known contemporary peers , but they do what they do really well . I hope with the success of this album it will inspire people to explore more progressive minded artists . `` The Resistance '' is definitely a good jumping off point ."}, "22815": {"id": "22814", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It has it 's moments . The songs are a little more pop than what we would ever expect from Muse and a few of the lyrics are uncomfortably sappy . `` Love is our resistance '' ? ? ? ? ( cringe ) But this is album is definitely worth owning if only for Exogenesis . It really is something special . Gorgeous ."}, "22816": {"id": "22815", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It happens to every band ; it 's practically a clich & eacute ; . At some point in an artist 's career , he or she will want to spread their wings and try something a bit ( or sometimes drastically ) different than their fans are used to . Before The Resistance came out , I went back on a Muse binge and listened to their albums . What I discovered when I finally started listening to The Resistance was that this album was inevitable . And the reviews here and elsewhere on professional sites/magazines are also inevitable : some proclaiming it Muse 's masterpiece , others that its a bad album . As you can probably tell , I 'm in the former category.The Resistance kicks off with `` Uprising , '' a track that seems to partake of the Dr. Who Theme Song and has a guitar flourish that first reminded me of the chorus to Blondie 's `` Call Me . '' This song has an electro , pulsating beat that continues the kind of electro-trend from `` Supermassive Black Hole . '' It took me a bit to feel its groove and now I 'm in love . The third track -- easily the album 's most `` controversial '' song -- is funky in an R & B ; way , mixing some hip-hop sounds with electronica and some nice thumping rock thrown in . It 's an amalgamation of so many different sounds that it 's probably Muse 's most adventurous.Of course there 's `` United States of Eurasia , '' which people have already decried as a ripoff of Queen . While it definitely does have a Queen influence , it 's not unique in Muse 's catalogue . You could see this direction in `` Knights of Cydonia '' which I found to be more Queen-like than `` Eurasia . '' Also I was a bit surprised to see it end with a twist of Nocturne In E-Flat Major , Op.9 No.2 by Fr & eacute ; d & eacute ; ric Chopin . You could tell that Matt Bellamy and company had a thing for classical music in some of their earlier music , but this is where it really hones in . Following this track is another classical-styled song , this time courtesy of the opera Samson and Delilah , entitled `` I Belong to You ( +Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix ) . '' Finally , as if to hammer this thought home , we have a three part symphonic monster of a song that incorporates a full orchestra and Matt on piano . This song is epic and moving , bringing in influences not only from Chopin but also Franz Liszt . Each movement blends well into the next ; the flowing arpeggios in `` Overture '' lead into the tinkling keys of `` Cross-Polination '' which climaxes with a rock section before ending with `` Redemption , '' a nice outro that ends the CD . It 's fantastic and a perfect closer for The Resistance.Thematically , The Resistance covers all the same topics fans come to expect , including love , standing up for what you believe in and a variety of political and conspiracy theories . `` United States of Eurasia '' references the book The Grand Chessboard concerning a political theory that the United States should control the Eurasian landmass for oil reasons . Other songs follow suit , with proclamations of `` I want the truth ! '' ( `` Unnatural Selection '' ) and `` Rise up and take the power back , it 's time that / The fat cats had a heart attack '' ( `` Uprising '' ) . Nothing really new here , but done with the typical Muse flair.And here we come back to the beginning . The Resistance is n't for everyone and I can definitely empathize with those turned off . It wears its classical leaning on its sleeve for all to see and indulges in enough modern pop and hip-hop styles that will make people who raised their eyebrows at `` Supermassive Black Hole '' really wonder what they 're listening to . But it 's been an inevitable journey , taking their latest albums as inspiration . It 's definitely not for everyone and your mileage may vary . For me , though , The Resistance is almost pitch perfect and a modern classic that will stay in my CD Player for quite a long while ."}, "22817": {"id": "22816", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "`` Fight The Power '' is the theme to the new Muse album , the set that should finally make the superstars in the USA . Matt Bellamy and crew have delivered on the promise of their deliriously coolBlack Holes and Revelations , opting to strike with the old fashioned concept album.Our hero of `` The Resistance '' starts off the album shouting `` They will not control us ! We will be victorious '' to a veryWe Will Rock You Theatricalbeat during `` Uprising . '' He rages against the machine and wonders if it 's all worth it without love ( the title track ) before giving in to love ( `` I want to reconcile the violence in your heart , '' he coos ) on `` Undisclosed Desires . '' You likely know where all this is headed , but you 'll still be surprised . There 's plenty of defiant cries like `` I want the truth ! '' or `` I 've traveled half the world to say I love you . '' sprinkled throughout `` The Resistance , '' yet Muse makes it all sound fresh and fun again.But then there 's the coup d'grace . The three part mini-symphony `` Exogenesis '' would do proud by bothYesorQueenor evenEmerson , Lake & Palmer . Rich on the Mozart and the prog , this just pushes Muse into a whole new world . Bellamy , bassist and backing vocalist Christopher Wolstenholme and drummer Dominic Howard can now soar as high as they 'd like . `` The Resistance '' is the mark of a band that refuses to set limits ; Muse are capably now blending rock , funk , progressive , alternative and classical in the scope of one CD .

Fortunately this has not affected their sense of identity and that once loathed alien/apocalyptic/surreal vision of the world has led them straight to the top of the charts and to the iPods of more people than we care to admit.What is the appeal they have over their listeners ? First , they CAN write great tunes but they add a twist and make them ridiculously fun . Second , they do n't take themselves seriously and unlike most of their contemporaries they are able sail from political denounces to comedic spurts without problem . Third , they take in all the comparisons and make them part of who they are.This is the most obvious point in their fifth studio recording . Having blown open the contrived label that capsuled `` prog-rock '' with Absolution and take it a notch further with Black holes and revelations , The resistance shows a Muse refusing to mature completely and using all their cards under the sleeve to reinvent a nearly extinct genre . This time the results might be less colored and more grey than in previous opportunities , but never dull.As if the banner had been raised from the start first single United States Of Eurasia is an open homage to Queen , not only in length but in composition . Give or take some nods at Chopin and even the presence of an Exocet launch at the end . The rest of the album will see Matt Bellamy , Christopher Wolstenholme and Dominique Howard indulging in their conspiracy theories , orchestral fascination and spacial aesthetics.They move from ballads ( I belong to you ) to straightforward rock ( Unnatural selection ) to a symphony in three movements ( Exogenesis ) that will not only give you an inside out cerebral trip but also leave you craving for nothing else when the odyssey is over . Uprising is a radio friendly cut that most reminisces what they 've done in the past ( like a breeding between the jolly Supermassive black hole and the sinister Time is running out ) , while the title track gives cue to the plot behind the record 's concept : resistance against general corporatocracy and the idea that love can cross boundaries between different political views and religious beliefs.One thing is impossible to deny : they have managed to deliver yet another amusing and tightly arranged album . The composition along with Bellamy 's incredible vocals are exquisite in execution , and we can only imagine how this record will sound live . As Chris conferred on a recent interview , their sound does not necessarily becomes bigger but different . Whether they have achieved that with The Resistance is something each listener will have to deduce ; if you asked me I would tell you I am eagerly expecting their new material ."}, "22820": {"id": "22819", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Love this album .

Alas , this effort falls just short of amazing , as I think `` Everybody '' suffers from a feeling of same-ness on many of the tracks . And although in this case it is a good thing , in that she performs nop-notch songs , a bit more diversity would be much welcome on this , which causes me to rate this at just 4 stars . But it is still a very good album , and I highly recommend ."}, "22823": {"id": "22822", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "After a few days of listening toEverybodyon continuous rotation , I have come to really enjoy this release as a whole . Most of these songs will end up on one playlist or another of mine , and that 's a testament to the range and variety of this album . While this album may not be best appreciated played in one sitting from start to finish , it includes a lot of songs that sound great when played individually or mixed in with other artists.In certain ways , this album is a natural extension of Ingrid Michaelson 's previous albums . Tracks like `` Everybody '' and `` Men Of Snow '' have the deceptively simple structure of some of her most successful songs . `` So Long '' has lovely vocals with simple and mellow guitar accompaniment . These kind of tracks are what many would expect an IM album to sound like.Yet tracks like `` Soldier '' and `` Mountain And The Sea '' remind me more of the rock ballads like `` Possession '' from Sara McLaughlin'sFumbling Towards Ecstasy . On those songs , the harmonies and driving instrumentation add an energy that I really like . And `` Locked Up '' continues that trend with a piano rock song that blends the hand clapping and simple structures of other songs.Songs like `` Sort Of '' seem to have more in common with the longing and softness of records like Tracey Chapman'sNew Beginning . The ground that she covers here gives you a sense of Ingrid Michaelson 's versatility as a song-writer and performer.I can appreciate the depth of more carefully written lyrics from prior albums , but I also respect that Ingrid is trying to expand her range as an artist . Some of these simpler songs may be more accessible and , thus , may win her new fans . There is always the risk that they may alienate long standing fans , but there is enough of her signature sound here . `` Once was Love '' is a good example of how this album is both a step forward and a step back from previous ones . On the one hand , we have a rich instrumentation that includes violins and layers of percussion . On the other , we have repetitious lyrics that recycle certain concepts . There is validity to the criticism that certain words , like that four letter word `` love , '' are over-used on these songs.And yet , I give her a pass on that for one reason . When I listen to each song individually , most of them are still very good on their own . As I said , they may not be well designed for playing in the same playlist , but most of them will end up in one playlist or another . I 'm not crazy about the repetition on songs like `` Once Was Love '' and `` Everybody . '' But judging by the fact that the title track is already successful as a single , it 's clear that most people disagree with me on that.My personal favorites are `` Soldier , '' `` Sort Of , '' `` Mountain And The Sea '' and `` Locked Up , '' though all of the other tracks add something . I think I like these tracks most because they show me a different side of Ingrid Michaelson that I did n't get to see as much of in prior albums.CONCLUSIONThis is an interesting new direction for Ingrid . The pop sensibility of this album is significantly increased , which may alienate some and appeal to others . But those willing to give this album a chance are likely to find more than a few songs that they like.Enjoy . **************************************NOTE : The first disk I received had a problem playing the last track , # 12 , `` Maybe .

Love the instrumental.Love the lyrics.Will go on ipod.Will probably be played as opposed to skipped frequently.12.Maybe-A really good ending track.It leaves the listener feeling really happy/good ( well at least me ) .Its very upbeat.I like it.I like how she chose to end the album on a positive track.Its like the feeling you get when you finish a really good book.I know I said I would talk about some of her other stuff ... but first I wan na say how I really enjoyed the packaging . It was really easy to maneuver.Not so much like a DVD case as other CDs.Where you have to yank and yank and turn and hope to not break it.Other songs : Somewhere over the rainbow-Watched her singing it with the Sandy Hook kids online.Bawled my eyes out.Just had to say that.Most played on Human Again : Fire , Do It Now , Blood Brothers ( Studio Version ) , Black and Blue , In the Sea , End of the world ( Studio recording is played more ... but i love how she introduces it in the live track ) , Live it with LoveWinter Song : I figured someone might ask.I mean I did say I 'm kinda here because of Sara Bareilles.I 'm not crazy about this song.Its two great music artists.But the song itself does n't really show off the best of either of them in my opinion.Hope this extremely long review helps someone ."}, "22825": {"id": "22824", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "So far 2009 has seen a number of `` sophomore '' releases from artists , and Everybody from Ingrid Michaelson is one of them ( I 'm not counting the EP Be OK but limiting to major releases ) . Fans looking for Girls and Boys Part II will not find what they are looking for in Everybody . However deviating from Girls and Boys is not necessarily a bad thing . I found Everybody to be a much more focused work . It is also much more mainstream ; however , some will not look on this favorably . You could almost makeInstrumentally , Everybody has more depth and variety . I loved the violin and cello on `` Soldier '' and `` Incredible Love '' . Michaelson also introduces Ukulele on songs such as `` Everybody '' and `` Mountain And The Sea '' . It has a feel similar to Israel Kamakawiwo ` Ole 's rendition of `` Somewhere Over The Rainbow '' from 50 First Dates . I also really enjoyed the subtly stated use of trumpet on `` So Long '' . Perhaps as a way of at least loosely connecting with her past work , `` Everybody '' and `` Mountain And The Sea '' also feature the folksy hand clapping that Michaelson used on Girls and Boys.Vocally , Everybody features more of Michaelson 's lower register . This comes right out of the gate on `` Soldier '' , and it continues on other tracks such as `` Sort Of '' , `` Maybe '' , and `` Incredible Love '' . That is not to say that Michaelson has switched exclusively to a dusky alto . Songs such as `` Are We There Yet '' , `` Men Of Snow '' , and `` The Chain '' have plenty of her upper register and falsetto . `` The Chain '' is the studio version of a song that we first heard on Be OK . It has the same vocal round at the end as the live version did , and it just does n't seem to fit with the rest of Everybody . As a final note , Everybody has good vocal harmony . I really liked the way this came through on the chorus of `` Mountain And The Sea '' and `` Maybe '' .Lyrically , Michaelson plays things much more straight up than she did on Girls and Boys . Love and relationships dominate Everybody as seen on `` Soldier '' - `` And so it goes . The soldier knows./The battle with the heart is n't easily won . '' and `` Maybe '' - `` Maybe in the future/you 're gon na come back/you 're gon na come back around '' . It is obvious from the title alone on `` Incredible Love '' and `` Once Was Love '' . The one song that would fit with the more unique style of Girls and Boys is `` Men Of Snow '' where Michaelson tells of building a snowman that she tells her troubles to only to find him melted the next day . Even this still seems friendlier to a wider audience than most of Girls and Boys.All in all , Everybody is a major step forward for Ingrid Michaelson . While I enjoyed Girls and Boys , it almost seems esoteric compared to Everybody . Michaelson has created a sound that while featuring greater breadth in vocal range and instrumentation is at the same time more focused .

As a result , prior to listening to their music , I was expecting a sound with far more prominent keyboards and synthesizers . But , in fact , their sound is more balanced with the guitars . Resemblances to The Shins are quite evident , and the band mentions The Shins as a group that they like . Singer K Ishibashi 's light-spirited vocals sound , to me , like a cross between the 80s groups Dexy 's Midnight Runners and Howard Jones . In fact , frequently while listening to the ninth track , `` Come On '' , I find myself mentally inserting `` ...

The 11 songs from founding members K Ishibashi ( vocals , guitars , violin ) and Zac Colwell ( vocals , guitars , keyboards ) and Mocha ( vocals , keyboards , violin ) , Panda Dougherty ( bass ) and David Heilmann ( drums ) pull from a variety of artistic canvases for a satisfying sound from the indie rock universe.The clean pop production of the single , Flaming Arrow , highlights a snappy bassline from Dougherty , though the sounds of U2 on Come On make it the best track . The witty Volcano is akin to the brief `` Drama '' era of Yes , while a double play of Made in a Day and Anna are driving pop , with the latter featuring layered vocals reminiscent of the Climax Blues Band.Heilmann keeps the pace quick on Lights Go Out and there is a pop wickedness in Find Me a Place . Simple Stones has a cool summertime groove , but the nice mix goes nowhere fast in High Plains Drifter Finds the Oracle at Delphi . The hop in Strange Teacher is nearly over before it gets rolling and the acoustic closer - People in the Mountain , People of the Ocean - has the pop sensibilities of Ray Davies.Produced by Chris Ribando ( whose engineering credits include Michael Jackson - The Ultimate Collection and Mary J. Blige - No More Drama ) and the band , the album is a foxy trail to a picturesque rainbow after a pelting storm of the typical fare spurting out of the radio ."}, "22837": {"id": "22836", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is one of the catchier pop albums I 've heard this year , and it comes out of the chute with a couple of really good uptempo tunes , `` Volcano '' and `` Lights Go Out '' . My first impression is a sound not unlike the currently-hot French band Phoenix . Unlike that more techno-oriented band , though , Jupiter One strives for a richer sound , complete with close harmonies and hints of orchestral arrangement . I hear influences of The Beach Boys , Paul McCartney , The Shins , and even Nate Ruess ' defunct band The Format . When they 're bopping along with edgy energy , they 're really enjoyable ( `` Come On '' , `` Made in a Day '' ) . It 's the midtempo tunes that tend to drag the album down a bit . `` High Plains Drifter Finds the Oracle at Delphi '' , for instance , is not nearly as interesting as it sounds . The album closes , however , with a short , folky , lovely number called `` People in the Mountain , People of the Ocean '' , which could have segued right out of McCartney 's `` Blackbird '' .

'' But when I heard that `` Jupiter One '' is a reference to the 1960 's science fiction television series , `` Lost in Space '' ( the spaceship on the program is named , `` Jupiter One '' ) , I immediately thought of this memorable phrase and important part of pop culture history , uttered by the robot in nearly every episode , `` Warning , Warning . Danger , Will Robinson ! `` , whenever some sort of alien was hiding behind the next ( fake looking , 60s plastic ) rock.OK , anyway , on to the music . Which I liked very much ! This one is going on my I-pod where I only put my favorite music . In the category of music dubbed `` Indie '' because the bands are creating and presenting their music in a non-mainstream way and do n't yet draw huge crowds , I think `` Jupiter One '' has alot of talent , including a strong base player , great vocals , and excellent rhythm ( in guitar , base , and drums ) .Who do they remind me of ? I 'll agree with other reviewers who have noted the tributes paid to other artists from decades before , and from a variety of genres . Except for a similarity at times to `` The Shins , '' I ca n't really compare them directly to any other performers . `` Jupiter One '' has a nice balance of originality and tradition . I particularly enjoy the upbeat melodies and rhythm of `` Lights Go Out , '' `` Flaming Arrow , '' `` Anna , '' and `` Simple Stones '' ( the first half of the CD ) .I 've kept the CD in my car , and with everything else to do there including paying attention to the road , making cell phone calls , broadcasting my I-pod on the radio , or listening to XM comedy ... . , for the last several days , `` Jupiter One '' and `` Sunshower '' have won out.Most people , and certainly the subset who review music , tend to possess lemming like qualities for following the crowd . I think `` Jupiter One '' is just one `` Soundtrack From A Good Movie or Hot Television Show About The Angst of Being 20ish '' away from hitting it big . For example , as did nearly everyone did who was lucky enough to have been on the marvelous `` Garden State '' soundtrack.This band is too talented , too respectful of their music heritage , and too creative to be overlooked .

This group , however , is a lot more pleasant sounding than the White Stripes , which for me is not necessarily a good thing . If the group had the vocal power of Adam Levine of Maroon 5 , then I would add another star . It does not . If it had the instrumental power of the White Stripes or Dead Weather , I would add another star . It does not . This album has a very pop-rock orientation instead of a blues-rock one . If you like pop-rock , this may be the group for you . I enjoy the tune ANNA quite a bit but it is a very pop oriented tune . There is nothing raw or wailing about it .

Jupiter One , named after the space ship from 'Lost In Space ' is a quasi-indie/alt rock band that 's music may be a little frazzled at times , has very distingwishable vocals , and last year they suprised me with their song `` Countdown . '' It was n't the best song of the year by any means , but it was a solid song nevertheless , and it had a nice feel to it . And while I did not listen to all of their debut , I would feel safe in venturing to say that this album presents something of a musical shift , with lots of 70s musical influences , and less of a radio-friendly sound . The result , is somewhat mixed.Highlights Include : VolcanoLights Go OutAnnaCome OnSound-wise , the album takes a lot of its cues from the late 70s , including tracks that sound vaguely disco-inspired , Eagles-esque , or just songs that fit in the general musical mood of the era . So , your opinion of the album may depend on your tolerance for a group like the Eagles . It does venture into pop rock and alt rock territory though , and this is where the album shines . It 's often frazzled , but Jupiter One does a great job with songs like `` Lights Go Out '' and `` Come On . '' I did n't find a distinguishable hit as in `` Countdown , '' but there 's quite a few solid tracks neverthelessHowever , the album has a major stumbling block , and that 's memorability . In reviewing this album I took a couple days off to meditate about it , but then found myself forgetting about it rather quickly . And while you tend to remember the highlights fairly quickly , and as the album grows on you over time , it just gets lost in the shuffle of its sound , then to the dark cravasses of your mind , never to be heard from again until you hear it the next time.Overall , Sunshower is a solid , earthy effort with more than a few songs to please Alt Rock , indie , and pop rock lovers with its 70s influence . There 's some very strong songs here , but the album is almost crushed under the weight of its longevity .

In 2009 , one wonders if anyone can bank on the success on Jupiter One in the current musical climate . Most of the songs would have been extremely innovative back in the 70s , although there are odd curiosities like `` Come On '' that sound like late 90s Alternative Rock.It 's a great album , but it 's terribly confused and released about 35-40 years too late .

Sure , I review solo artists and bands I 've never personally before purchased , but never one I 've never heard of at all . Because of my interests in constantly broadening musical horizons , I found that Jupiter One'sSunshowerwould be an interesting listening considering I had no idea what to expect . An indie-rock release , Jupiter One proves to be trivial as many indie bands are , but the music and the songs themselves on 'Sunshower ' are quite accessible , and quite well put together . 'Sunshower ' is n't the second-coming of course , but it is a good representation of indie-rock . `` Volcano '' , my first slice of Jupiter One , proves impressive with its happy , major-key sound . Even more drawing is the harmonized background vocals on a neutral 'ah ' syllable . The vocals are soulful and poppy here , making for a great combination . `` Volcano 's '' refrain specifically is catchy and grows addictive ; sure it 's not as addictive as Top 40 Radio , but addictive enough to stick in one 's head . `` Lights Go Out '' features interesting production work and jagged rhythmic guitar . While the track is n't quite as enthralling as `` Volcano '' , it still showcases good songwriting with an enjoyable indie-pop sound . The hook is definitely catchy . `` Flaming Arrow '' would 've sounded completely fresh in the late 1960s - early 70s folk-pop/rock era . Despite the vintage sound , this track falls short of sounding like an anachronism . Instead , it sounds cool and catches the ear . The chord progression , namely during the refrain is rather neatly put together . `` Made in a Day '' benefits from a big bass line and an accelerated tempo . While it does n't sink in as a 'classic ' or supersede the greatness of either `` Volcano '' or `` Flaming Arrow '' , it is still solid . Best of all , it is brief in duration . `` Anna '' proves to be much more enjoyable than `` Made in a Day '' , invoking an anthemic pop sound . The sound is still somewhat subdued ( like much of indie-pop/garage-rock/pop ) , but there is something more potent here , much like `` Volcano '' . The vocal harmonies are beautiful and vocally , the performance has more a more vibrant , shimmering quality . `` Simple Stones '' , like `` Anna '' features nothing less than stunning production work , this time evoking a soulful , disco-laden quality , much like the early 1970s . `` Simple Stones '' would 've suited the Rolling Stones well , ala their ubiquitous hit `` Miss You '' . Enjoyable by all means , `` Simple Stones '' lays extremely well here both vocally and musically . `` High Plains Drifter Finds the Oracle at Delphi '' is obviously conceptual by the title . Less accessible than some previous tracks , it is nonetheless interesting and exciting . The music maybe most captivating , though the vocal performance is both soulful and affecting as well . `` Find Me A Place '' opens with a funky , soul-laden introduction , again embarking on a production treasure trove . The refrain proves poppy , making this soulful track easily enjoyable to the everyday listener . `` Come On '' cranks up the tempo with driving , rock-driven guitars . A thin , but constant driving bass line underlies the rest of the production . `` Come On '' does n't sound completely unlike a Sting & The Police song in sound . While the refrain is catchy , the song lacks the substance and draw of the best on 'Sunshower ' . `` Strange Teacher '' evokes an old-school folk-rock quality , making it similar to `` Flaming Arrow '' , and equally alluring . Closing track `` People in the Mountain , People of the Ocean '' is typical indie-rock ( think the Shins ) , but it is n't as fun or as exciting as the best ( `` Volcano '' , `` Flaming Arrow '' , `` Anna '' , etc . ) Overall , 'Sunshower ' is a good album that shifts styles enough and maybe even too much at times . Well-rounded , there are weaker numbers , though the production and the overall sound sell the album throughout .

Some of the synth work DEFINATELY refers to the New Wave period of rock , but the beats are far too `` organic '' sounding , for this music to sound like drum machine / Yamaha DX-7 new wave dance era .

There are other strong tracks that are good old-fashion alternative country and I have mad respect for namely : the LIVE version of Temazcal ( ancient sweatlodge ? ) , The Sandman the Breakman and Me , Magic Marker , Map of the World , and Slow Down Jo , all of which feature beautifully inventive guitar work .

Ward ( of She and Him ) , and Conor Oberst and Mike Mogist ( of Bright Eyes ) . Wow , when you see a collaberative of that stature , your expectations ca n't helped but be high . So how did this actually turn out ? `` Monsters Of Folk '' ( 15 tracks ; 55 min . ) is equally ( almost too politically correct , in a way ) divided in 5 songs for each of Jim James , M. Ward and Conor , in which each of them has lead vocals . But besides that , the band does have a complete mixing up as to who plays what . Each of the members takes turns at one point or another playing the drums , bass , lead guitars , keyboards , and whatever other instruments , just impressive . As to the songs , however , they are all quite subdued , yet gentle ( there is only one 'rocking ' tune on here , `` Losin To Head '' ) . It all flows by very beautifully , but to me ithe overall album did n't resonate all that much unfortunately . Sure , there are several outstading tracks , such as `` Say Please '' , `` Man Named Truth '' and the beautiful closer `` His Master 's Voice '' , but considering all the talent that is behind this collection , I could n't help but feel a bit let down . Is this a bad album ? Of course not . But it 's not the `` home run out of the park '' that it could 've been either.That said , I can only imagine how amazing it will be to see this band live in concert .

The Future of Rock and Roll ) , the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country ."}, "22861": {"id": "22860", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The announcement of Monster of Folk 's debut album this year instinctively drew a knee-jerk reaction of dread from me , despite its pristine indie pedigree . After Tinted Windows defined the term `` novelty supergroup '' yet again for the year 2009 , I was just a little worried that ego and the sense of `` fun '' that routinely leads artists to ill-advised collaborations would cause the sum of talent here to be considerably less than its individual parts . Luckily for me and fans of the people on display here , Monsters of Folk works more like a well-oiled , cohesive `` best-of '' collection of each , rather than a clash of styles or a neutered effort of bland , wankish jam sessions . Made up of Conor Oberst ( Bright Eyes , Mystic Valley Band ) , M. Ward ( She & Him ) , Jim James ( My Morning Jacket ) , and Mike Mogis ( producer extraordinaire ) , Monsters of Folk 's terrible title belies its eminently accessible nature.Unlike , say , James Iha and Taylor Hanson , Monsters of Folk 's previous bodies of work definitely share a sort of kinship . From Oberst 's post-Cassadaga work , to James ' obviously country-ish bent , to Ward 's folksy , ` 60s-pop-worshipping solo releases , it seems almost preordained that this foursome would eventually find each other , with Mogis ' instrumental wizardry and understated production serving as the glue of the album . Best of all , despite its 15-song length and influences-on-their-sleeves style , Monsters of Folk never comes off as a gimmick , or , worse , a mere compilation . Oberst never dominates one track and then disappears on the next ; James ' does n't make one song his personal My Morning Jacket clone and then let someone else take the spotlight on the next . Rather , Monsters of Folk melds them all into what consistently feels like a natural record , one where new listeners might be surprised to learn of the members ' disparate backgrounds . `` Dear God ( sincerely M.O.F . ) '' does start things off pretty shaky , and you 'd be forgiven for thinking it was an Evil Urges outtake , and a terrible one at that . But the bad taste is quickly wiped away with the irresistible , fuzzy energy of `` Say Please , '' where the gorgeous but clearly distinct harmonies gives the song a true group feel , a ` la Crosby Stills and Nash ( or , dare I say it , the Beatles ) . From there on it 's a veritable treasure trove of woodsy , vibrant music , a grab bag of styles notable not for their differences but by how well they mesh as one . Hear Ward and company burn it on up tempo alt-country rocker `` Whole Lotta Losin ; ' '' hear Oberst do his best Johnny Cash impression on the fingerpicked western-flavored `` Man Named Truth ; '' best of all , hear all three of them play off each other on the restless build-up of highlight `` Baby Boomer . `` It 's easy to distinguish between the three vocalists , from Ward 's smoky , soulful vocals to Oberst ' wobbling entreaties to James ' immediately identifiable falsetto , yet their effortless harmonies and vocal interplay is sharpened to a lovingly refined point . Musically the band 's closest touchstones are Ward 's last two solo efforts , as songs like the woodsy `` Goodway , '' `` Magic Marker '' and many more mimic the kind of ` 60s pop/Americana folk pastiche he 's strived for , although Oberst 's Mystic Valley influence is well represented here ( his inexplicable Mexico fascination continues on `` Temazcal '' ) . But far be it from them to discriminate - songs like acoustic shuffler `` Map of the World '' reflect Fleet Foxes ' multi-part harmonies and Appalachian character , while `` The Right Place '' sounds like vintage , It Still Moves-era My Morning Jacket . The record as a whole continues to build up its own identity as it goes on , thanks in large part to Mogis ' eclectic production and the refusal of the tracks to fall into a stylistic rut.Sure , it 's a little long , and the opening and closing tracks are two of the worst bookends for an album in recent memory , but perhaps that 's just merely a testament to the strength of the material in between . After hearing Monsters of Folk for the first time it 's easy to write it off as a success in its genre and a ( huge ) success for the supergroup ideal , but repeated listens show it as much more than that . Songs like `` Say Please '' or `` Baby Boomer '' practically sound like they were recorded in a live setting , the band 's energy a nearly palpable feeling throughout . Monsters of Folk is a great album , and it achieves this excellence not with fancy studio tricks , particularly amazing songwriting , or virtuoso musicianship , but with that which so many other supergroups have lacked : a refreshing passion for the material , the kind of passion that is impossible to ignore ."}, "22862": {"id": "22861", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "In one of the more unlikely combos sinceTinted Windowscame out this year , Jim James ( or as he has taken to calling himself Yim Yames ) ofMy Morning Jacket , blues/folkieM Wardand Dylanesque folk-mongerConor OberstofBright Eyeshave teamed up to mingle their overlapping tastes for this album . Add producer and Bright Eyes multi-instrumentalist Mike Mogis , and you get a thoroughly enjoyable folk album that draws on each members ' individual bests.I got to see the Monsters on tour at Philadelphia 's Academy of Music and was astonished at just how well these guys blended together . Oberst is probably the closest thing to an old-school folkie of the bunch , with Ward being more a blues singer and James adding a southern accent to MMJ 's psychedelic pop-rock . When they unleash a traditional folk song like `` Man Named Truth , '' they hit everything dead center . James brings in the Neil Young school of other-worldliness , used best on the closing `` His Master 's Voice '' or theThe Grateful Deadsound-alike `` The Right Place . '' Ward leads on `` Slow Down Jo '' and the others add harmonies that hold up theCrosby , Stills , Nash & Youngcomparisons that have been tossed at this album.That kind of hype is a bit unfair to the band , as the Monsters do n't seem to have an agenda like CSN did , and `` The Travelling Folkberries '' seems more apt . There 's plenty of great moments here , like `` Map Of The World , '' `` Say Please '' and the previously mentioned songs . But there 's also the occasional trip-up , like the pretentious opener , `` Dear God , '' or the tossed off sounding `` Goodway .

That night , I bought their first CD . I was impressed with nearly every track and I went out and bought a CD from Hansard 's other band , The Frames.Then a few months later , I saw that Hansard and Marketa were appearing in a film together called Once , which features a great deal of music from that Swell Season CD . I was overjoyed to see the band would then go on to win an Oscar.So is there a sophomore slump or hangover with Strict Joy , the duo 's second CD ? Not at all . It is excellent . Every track is great and I was impressed that most of the music is softer than what Hansard has done with The Frames . It 's a different side to him that should be explored more , I think , in future projects . As for Marketa , she is great but I prefer listening to his voice .

It was a bit of an underdog triumph when they won the `` Best Song '' Oscar last year for `` Falling Slowly '' , arguably the best romantic ballad of the decade . Now they follow up that success with a new album under their collective name , The Swell Season . It 's a more polished affair than either their debut album or the `` Once '' soundtrack , but it 's also much more cohesive . You wo n't hear Hansard 's raw , shouting vocals that punctuated the songs from `` Once '' , but that 's not a problem . This is definitely a mellower affair , and the songwriting is every bit as strong and more mature . It 's not as cathartic as some of the songs from `` Once '' , but it 's still quietly moving ."}, "22867": {"id": "22866", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Strict Joy is an achievement . It chronicles every feeling of falling out of love ; unexpected loneliness , second guessing yourself , blindly thinking you still have a chance , guilt , questioning life , wondering why it all had to happen , and at the end , acceptance , however bittersweet it may be . The music never condescends the listener with any sappy breakup songs that scream `` poor me '' . It 's more of an audio diary of the decline of the real relationship of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova , and if any musicians these days know about catharsis , it 's these guys . It also does n't hurt that they 're two of the best musicians working today , and they are a revelation when put together . As if they 're already great enough when they 're each on their own , there 's nothing better than hearing these two harmonize.The album begins with the sweeping , charming Low Rising , which I 've loved to death since they performed it on the Tonight Show however many months ago . I have to say I like most live versions of this better than this studio version ( partly because of the mix ) but that does n't change how good of a song it really is . Then the album has a two-song slump , which is the only low point of the whole album . No matter how many times I 've tried to like Feeling the Pull , I just can not . And In These Arms is better , but I really ca n't find anything to it ; it just feels standard to me . But after this slump comes one of the best parts of the record , tracks 4-6 . I ca n't explain how much I love all 3 of these songs . They of course all contribute to the scope of the full album , but if they were released on their own as an EP , it 'd be one of my favorite EPs released by any band . High Horses is n't necessarily one of the best on the record , but it 's a good song nontheless . After that , every track ( and I mean every track ) is golden , with the exhilirating The Verb being one of the very high points of the record ( which actually is n't saying much , because nearly every song here is a high point of the record ) . Back Broke closes the album in a desperate , sad , and very real fashion , and if someone told me this was exactly how the couple ended their relationship , I would n't doubt them.Buy Strict Joy . I might 've given you some of the best advice you 've heard in a while . This is worth your money , and much more . It 's one of the most satisfying listening experiences I 've had all year .

'' Of course I was swept away by that charming film , and since music was so integral to its appeal , buying the soundtrack was a no-brainer . Yet my love for the movie did not quite translate to the soundtrack which ( though not bad by any means ) has not earned anything close to heavy rotation at home or in the car.So it was only natural that the new album by The Swell Season ( Hansard and Irglova ) , `` Strict Joy , '' would end up in my hands too . And I have listened to this album almost nonstop since I first gave it a spin about a week ago . The difference , I think , is one of scale and scope . Although I love the music from `` Once , '' I have a somewhat limited appetite for spare , singer-songwriter music without any significant backing instrumentation . All of the music from the `` Once '' soundtrack was beautiful in and of the moment , but not addictive in the same way that a really great album can be . `` Strict Joy '' is that kind of great album . The cohesive feel of the songs is immediately apparent , yet the album is not repetitive or tedious in any way . It 's true that heartache is the subject matter throughout , yet the songs are so fresh and beautiful that I am never left feeling that I 've heard it all before.The first two songs could n't seem more different . `` Low Rising '' plods along languidly , perfect for a slow dance or a slow drink at the bar . The song is guided by a growling Hansard , and a mournful , bluesy electric guitar solo . `` Feeling the Pull , '' at the opposite end , is a jangly , twinkling folk song , full of wanderlust and melancholy.The remainder of `` Strict Joy '' charts the territory in between these polarities , such as the sweet darkness of `` In These Arms , '' `` Paper Cup , '' and `` Back Broke , '' and the innocent sadness of `` Fantasy Man '' and `` I Have Loved You Wrong . '' Yet the best songs may be `` The Rain , '' which starts off with just Hansard and an acoustic guitar , but escalates to a soaring , full-band sound with guitars , strings and a xylophone , and `` High Horses , '' a moody , fast-paced number reminiscent of Death Cab for Cutie at their best and REM 's `` Losing My Religion .

No , the sound heard on their second full-length , 2009 's `` War Is The Answer , '' actually falls somewhere between Lamb Of God , Shadows Fall , Exhorder , Anthrax , and Metallica . `` War '' certainly covers all of the usual thrash bases , as it ranges from thrashy beatings to soaring power ballads ( see `` Far From Home '' ) , and even goes so far as to include an entirely instrumental track , as well . ( `` Canto 34 '' is a four-minute long instrumental with crunchy , chunky , guitar and bass riffs that only stop cascading down upon the listener 's eardrums to drop in some exceptional , and fairly ripping solos . ) And the heck of it is , the highlights do n't stop there ! `` Bulletproof , '' with its Slayer-meets-Pantera buzzsaw riff and Yngwie Malmsteen-esque melodic shred soloing , is a possible highpoint ; although it does have some competition in a track like `` Hard To See , '' with its crunchy , syncopated , even at times borderline funky-sounding groove that evokes some latter-day Ministry material , and huge , soaring , stadium-sized chorus.Elsewhere , `` Dying Breed '' sounds very reminiscent of Slipknot 's `` Before I Forget '' in that it anchors lurching rhythms and serrated , crunching guitar and bass riffs with tight double bass thudding . The number , a powerful set opener , also tucks in a memorable melodic chorus and even a decent guitar solo , into the mix . `` Crossing Over , '' then , is a sweet , cleanly-sung ballad that falls somewhere between Staind 's `` It 's Been A While '' and Guns ` N ' Roses ' `` Sweet Ol ' Child Of Mine . `` But it is immediately followed-up by `` Burn It Down , '' which is backed by a hefty , thrashing chug and stomp , shredding solos , and really powerful and memorable lyrics and vocal patterns . Two other highlights include the steady , chugging hardcore-beating and breakdown-happy rhythms in `` No One Gets Left Behind '' ; and the Anthrax-meets-Hatebreed album closing title song.In the grand scheme of things , FFDP can not be said to have delivered a total knock-out , here , as `` War '' does not exactly make for a very life-changing or even absolutely essential listen .

This album really shows that these guys have definately done some serious growing and maturing since the first album , it 's simply incredible on every level with an excellent mix of balls to the wall songs including `` Dying Breed '' , `` Burn it Down '' , `` No One Gets Left Behind '' , `` Bulletproof '' , and `` War is the Answer '' , and more slower and melodic cuts such as `` Far From Home '' , `` Crossing Over '' , and `` Walk Away '' .

The second track and first single `` Hard to See '' is a very catchy and melodic driven song that really showcases Ivan 's amazing melodic vocal abilities especially in the chorus , and there 's also an excellent guitar solo at 2:08 , while track three `` Bulletproof '' is another fast and heavy track that boasts more machine gun riffs and double bass action and another good balance between screaming and singing . Up next , we got `` No One Gets Left Behind '' which is a heavy and angry war/political song , while `` Crossing Over '' is a nice ballad which features some heartfelt vocals and lyrics , and another fantastic solo is thrown in as well . My personal favorite song , that being track six `` Burn it Down '' is another catchy and heavy hitting song that is highlighted by heavy trudging-like riffs that hit like bricks and straight up angry screams especially in the chorus , and there 's another excellent guitar solo thrown in as well . I can just imagine myself lifting weights to this song . `` Far From Home '' is another masterful and excellent ballad type song that features another incredible vocal performance by Ivan . This song seriously is just absolutely incredible , believe me . `` Falling in Hate '' meanwhile , is another heavy and addicting cut that features more straight up screaming vocals and slow yet punishing and menacing riffs , while `` Canto 34 '' is an incredibly outstanding and impressive instrumental cut that has attitude written all over it , and features more of Jason 's excellent leadwork and powerful heart pounding and headbanging riffs , and a great drum beat to go with that . Next we have the band 's cover of Bad Company 's classic hit `` Bad Company '' . I was so surprised and impressed at how well they covered this song , and I love the solo around 2:51 , and Ivan of course delivers another strong and powerful melodic vocal performance , and last but not least , the final track `` War is the Answer '' is a heavy and crunchy album closer that boasts driving double bass pedal slamming , bone crunching riffs and a ripping solo , and all-out angry screaming vocals and lyrics . A ferocious album closer this one is.All in all , `` War is the Answer '' is an absolute incredible and outstanding sophmore effort from Five Finger Death Punch , and it 's definately a huge step forward for these guys as well . It really makes you wonder what the next album is going to sound like . This album definately shows that they 're not afraid to show every single emotion that they possess in their hearts and souls . Anyways , if you enjoyed 5FDP 's first album `` The Way of the Fist '' , then by all means , you 'll definately enjoy `` War is the Answer '' . Highly Recommended ! !"}, "22881": {"id": "22880", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is an album that will pave the way for heavier radio rock and possibly get heavier metal bands like Trivium onto the radio . While I would much rather prefer this be on radios everywhere over the modern pop we get , this album does a have it 's share of flaws . One being some repetition ( as in a few songs sound the same ) , lyrics ( a big drawback ) , and just too many tracks on the album . 13 is quite a number for a standard album . The vocalist is very good , very distinct , the guitars are much better than I ever would 've expected from a more mainstream rock/metal band , and the bass and drums are pure gold ! The music:1 . Dying Breed- This song stomps on your eardrums to kick this album off ! Ivan 's growls are very distinct ! I can tell it 's him and his clean vocals are great ! This song is a headbang fest ! This is the kind of thing you could wake up the Army with ! The drumming is extremely good on this , the bass is not only audible , but it drives the music ! ! ! And the guitar solo is extremely well done ! The soloist is competent enough to not just shred , but to make a story out of his solo ! Great work on the musicians ' part ! EXCELLENT SONG ! ! ! I LOVE IT ! ! ! ! 2 . Hard to See- This is the song I would expect to hear on the radio out of all the songs on this album ! It sounds like the modern hard rock style , but more metal ! There is double bass in the chorus and riffing between chorus and verse . The verses sound more like a groove/80 's heavy metal song , but the chorus sounds like a slower , melodic metal anthem . This song is another standout track ! I really like the intensity it has even though it is more reserved ! The guitar solo and instrumental sections are freakin ' amazing ! It 's the kind of stuff I 'd expect from a more complex band , but delivered in a similar style to Breaking Benjamin meets In Flames ! EXCELLENT SONG ! ! ! 3 . Bulletproof- This one is intense and has a thrash/groove feel to it ! Then the chorus is one of the most melodic of the album ! I love this chorus ! And the riff too ! Heck just the song ! Ivan 's voice is great here , the guitars are very in-your-face and the drumming is intense and aggressive ! The bass is n't as present as it was on Dying Breed , but it 's still produced and mixed very well ! The solo on this song is good , but it does n't come anywhere close to the previous two solos . The drum work on here though just makes me so happy ! If this song was on the radio , my day would be made ! This is the perfect balance of heavy and melody to be put on the radio ! Another amazing track ! 4 . No One Gets Left Behind- This one sees things heavy and reserved at the same time . It 's not as reserved as Hard to See , but it 's not as heavy as the other 2 previous tracks . The riffs on this one are more alternative/thrash/groove metal and the chorus is more of a radio rock band . The style comes off very well-done and it 's still heavy enough to warrant some head banging actions ! The drumming is great again and the guitar work is more atmospheric this time around . The middle section has just riffing without a solo . I feel that there could 've been something bigger there , but the song is fine without anything . Good song ! 5 . Crossing Over- I feel that this song is ok , but not ok enough to be on the album . As others have said , it sounds like Hard to See in the chorus . It is a more brooding ballad in the verses , but the chorus just kind of takes away from the song 's potential since it 's akin to a track we just heard 7 minutes ago . Ok song , not really good nor bad , just there.6 . Burn it Down- The opening riff sounds brutal and epic , but I feel that this song is just a bit too much testosterone . It 's got the heaviness I want , but this is one where the lyrics get in my way . Just too much unnecessary cursing and just no real lyrical value . Not that the other songs have lyrical value , but this one just really disappoints me . The guitars are good in this one too . Pity.7 . Far from Home- This one is a real ballad . This song is beautiful and holds some real lyrical value . Ivan 's voice is very strong and emotional on this song ! He really sounds good here . As it is a ballad , the band kind of takes the back seat for this one , but it 's still a good musical backdrop for his voice . The guitar solo sounds like a Hair Metal solo , but in this case , that 's a very huge plus ! It just fits so well ! Awesome song ! ! ! 8 . Falling in Hate- This song was just very unnecessary . The lyrics , while somewhat humorous are just horrendous and the music is ok. Not the best song on the record . I feel that it 's filler . I just really did n't find this track to be a relevant song . It 's just dumb.9 . My Own Hell- The opening guitar part is heavy and then it opens up into an atmospheric melodic rock song . The verse is definitely something that could make the airwaves heavier . The chorus is very melodic and laid back and shows Ivan 's melodic senses again ! The verses are thrashy and groove along with a good amount of bass and double bass drumming . The guitar work is more melodic through the chorus and more thrashy in the verses and bridge . The song lacks a guitar solo , which I feel it could 've used , but this is a very good song without one . This is one that I can sing along with . The ending guitar part is amazing ! It sounds kind of like a Dream Theater guitar tone/part and it just makes me happy ! ! ! Good song ! 10 . Walk Away- This is a ballad/rocker song that shows a more alternative metal sound than the other tracks . This song reminds me of Breaking Benjamin vocally . His vocals just have that tone in the verse . The chorus is n't pulled off as well as other songs , but I do still find this song enjoyable . It 's something I can sing along with . The guitar solo on this song is impressive . It 's not much , but the tone of the guitar and the way the solo is played just reminds me of Neal Schon of Journey ( one of my favorite guitar players ) just in a heavier setting than he is usually in . I like this song ! 11 . Canto 34- This song is phenomenal ! Like really , for a radio/alternative metal band , this is freakin ' amazing ! Not only can they deliver great songs , but this band has an instrumental that 's longer than their songs on the album that rocks just as hard as their vocal songs ! I love this ! It 's something I could work out or walk to ! It 's melodic , full of solos and full of attitude . The drums could 've been done heavier in some places , but besides that , this is just freakin ' awesome ! This band has the potential to make music complex like Dream Theater and Trivium if they want to ! This instrumental proves that . AWESOME SONG ! ! ! ! 12 . Bad Company- This is a cover of Bad Company by a band of the same name . I 've never heard the original , but while this song is good , I do n't feel that this should 've been on the standard edition because the song just does n't do much for me . Now , that being said , I can see why it was put on the album because it gained the band a boat load of acclaim and recognition . It 's good for that , but for me , I personally do n't care much for the track.13 . War is the Answer- Just no ... The opening riff sounds absolutely amazing and the jam that happens after that is also amazing , but this song is absolutely lame in the lyrical department . Like really this song could 've been another instrumental and I would 've loved it . The lyrics , however suck . I 'm a fan of metal with intellectual and intelligent lyrics , so in that respect , this band is already lucky that I checked them out and like some of their stuff , but this song is just stupid . Musically , I have no problem with it . Ivan put way too much testosterone in the lyrics with all the f bombs and unnecessary swearing . Stupid song . Absolutely stupid.Verdict- This album has its fair share of amazing tracks that will impress and it 's fair share of wasted minutes . The good songs will be things I crank up when I just want some heavy stuff to blast and the bad songs will never willingly reach my ears again . All in all , this is good radio metal , but because it is made for radio , it has some drawbacks . I think it is a good purchase for fans of Avenged Sevenfold , Slipknot , and Disturbed . However , if you like Trivium , Dream Theater , Evergrey , or other bands of that nature , you will be more than happy with the riffage , but the lyrics might not deliver.Happy Shopping"}, "22882": {"id": "22881", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "After enjoying `` The Way of The Fist '' , I was looking forward to FFDP next release.It was worth the wait and not at all disappointing.They have n't really been around long enough to compare all their releases , being I only know of two albums.If you had to compare the two , they made some fine tunings and perhaps more mature song writing on this effort.More melodic and balladry.They are a metal band , so you are to expect heavy and loud stuff.They deliver .

Not so . Stockdale recruited two new , very competent musicians in bassist Ian Peres ( who also plays keyboards ) and drummer Dave Atkins . The band 's rhythm section was also completed and made fuller and better-sounding with the addition of a rhythm guitarist named Aidan Nemeth . And with this new band in tact , the Australian four-piece released a sophomoric full-length effort in 2009 , `` Cosmic Egg . '' As a result , their Seventies/Eighties-worshipping hard rock/heavy metal sound ( which is heavily influenced by the likes of Black Sabbath , Led Zeppelin , Rush , Deep Purple , UFO , Rainbow , Dio , Pentagram , and Jethro Tull ) is not only present , here , it sounds as sharp as ever . Simply put , on `` Cosmic Egg , '' Wolfmother sound more Wolfmother-y than ever before.With its `` Ace Of Spades '' -era Motorhead-esque bass intro and propulsive , swinging bass grooves , `` California Queen '' is bass propelled-opener -- although it does make plenty of room for some unexpectedly shrieky , whammy-bar-guitar soloing and Robert Plant-meets-Chris Cornell-esque vocals . By doing so , Wolfmother created an insanely catchy , feel-good , and nearly-danceable modern hard rock classic . Although not quite as irresistible as the above , lead single `` New Moon Rising '' is a keeper because it marries bluesy , bottom-heavy , Tony Iommi-derived riffing , tasty wah-pedal licks and more propulsive and powerful bass lines with bluesy , Southern-tinged crooning and memorable melodic choruses . `` White Feather , '' despite mostly playing like a full-on White Stripes ode , does retain some catchy , bobbing guitar hooks and a pulsing bass throb . And it is all capped off by more memorable vocals and lyrics , as well as a terrifically epic , wailing , 40-second long solo to cap it all off , too.The really tasty , Tom Morello-inspired `` wah-wah '' guitar licks of `` Sundial '' hooks the listener into a deep , crunching guitar/bass groove . Meanwhile , the guitarists are ripping out UFO-styled unorthodox , shredding solos . The tune does retain some melody , though , as some cool , jazzy piano keys and soaring melodic choruses are sprinkled into the mix , too . Next up , aside from featuring some acrobatic soloing in the background , and a strong , prominently grumbling bass bottom that flows along with the whole song , `` In The Morning '' actually plays mostly like a pretty , laid-back , Beatles-esque ballad . But this is then followed up by perhaps the heaviest song on the record , the thunderous `` 10,000 Feet , '' which features a wealth of surprisingly metallic and viscerally satisfying , chunky , grinding , Sabbath-y , pure doom riffage . And it is all augmented by a strong , chugging bass line.Two later tracks , the title song and `` In The Castle , '' both play like oh-so-Iron Maiden-ish tunes , with their rhythmic , galloping grooves , simple , chugging licks , powerful bass bottom , and terrific , shredding solos . And if that were n't enough , the latter of these tunes also features an extremely trippy , proggy intro , dramatic-sounding drum rolls , and noteworthy lyrics . ( It deals with power metal-type fantastical storytelling about going places `` that you have never been , '' etc . ) `` Far Away '' is the perfect accompaniment to these two tracks in that it is a very psychedelic power ballad with nicely melodic bass lines , a wailing , classical-sounding piano line , and Stockdale doing his best Ozzy Osbourne impression ( if Ozzy 's nads were in a vice , that is ) . A whopper , crunching stoner metal eventually kicks in , though , taking things into much heavier territory.And `` Pilgrim '' is great continuation of THAT song because it , too , features some big , sludgy , distorted , hard rocking , deeply grooving Sabbath-meets-Zeppelin guitar and thundering bass riff slices . And some Jimi Hendrix-inspired licks and a bout of surprisingly blistering solos are also included , here . Then , following the nearly five-minute long exercise in exceptional soloing that practically makes your fingers itch to play along with on air-guitar ( `` Phoenix '' ) , comes the album 's fittingly very progressive and epically epic closer , `` Violence Of The Sun . '' It is a six-minute long closer centered around siren-like guitar melodies and deft , crashing cymbals . Sure , the odd big , doomy power chord occasionally comes smashing through , making its arrangements heavy and momentous -- but only occasionally.In conclusion , it may have taken an overlong amount of time ( three years ) to produce , but with this album , Wolfmother have definitely created a very worthy follow-up to their eponymous debut . `` Cosmic Egg '' may not take many huge -- or even substantial -- musical leaps and bounds for the Australian band , but it is definitely a hugely enjoyable and memorable , hard rocking good time . As such , it is easy to recommend all Seventies/Eighties revivalists , and fans of hard rock/heavy metal , in general ."}, "22897": {"id": "22896", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This album comes after a so-called break-up . well , more bands need to break up , more often !

Wolfmother originally started as a power trio out of Australia fronted by singer and guitarist Andrew Stockdale with Chris Ross on bass and organ and Myles Heskett keeping them together on drums . Their debut CD reached number twenty two on the Billboard charts after drawing comparisons to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin among other notable 60s and 70s hard rock heavyweights . In 2007 , Wolfmother even won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for their song `` Woman . '' After headlining festivals and selling out large venues all over the world , Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008 leaving Stockdale as the only remaining member.After what seemed like ages for classic rock starved fans , Wolfmother is back with a sophomore release that is even better than their debut . With howls resembling Robert Plant at the peak of his career and riffs rotating between Black Sabbath , Led Zeppelin , and White Stripes influences , Andrew Stockdale has proven he was the driving force behind Wolfmother from the very beginning . His new band consisting of Ian Peres on bass and keyboards , guitarist Aidan Nemeth , and Dave Atkins on drums compliments Stockdale 's style perfectly . Where Wolfmother 's first album often felt rough around the edges , their new release is polished to an incredible shine . The punk influences heard on songs like `` Apple Tree '' are less apparent on Cosmic Egg , but can still be heard in songs like `` White Feather . `` Cosmic Egg excels in maintaining consistently catchy and impressive rock from beginning to end . The lead single `` New Moon Rising , '' the Zeppelin-esque `` 10,000 feet , '' and the slower tempo `` Far Away '' may be stand out tracks , but the album is excellent straight through . When I first listened to this album , I thought it was an overall excellent release , but a few of the tracks felt out of place . I then realized these were the additional tracks found exclusively on the Deluxe Edition . Take those four extras out and Cosmic Egg is truly an album to remember . If you find the majority of your favorite artists are now over the age of 50 , I highly recommend you give Wolfmother a try . They had one of the best debuts in a long time , but with Stockdale 's new lineup of definite talent , Wolfmother has only gotten better and will hopefully continue to make music for many years to come.Similar Artists : Black Sabbath , Rose Hill Drive , The RaconteursTrack Suggestion : New Moon Rising"}, "22899": {"id": "22898", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "After what seemed like forever , Wolfmother is back with their second release that is even better than their debut .

I had n't heard about Woldmother ? Apparently , until the night before , he had n't either . So he let me listen to a few snippets of tunes on his i-Pod . Yup . Sounds good . Sure . Another hard rock band I should be into , eh ? Uh-huh.Then I heard the guitar riff for 'Sundial ' . What the heck was that ? That 's cool . So , I ordered the delux-edition of the album , hoping for lots of Sundial riffs . What I got was n't disappointing at all.I gave CD 1 a spin in my car while driving and when it was done it spun a second time before CD 2 went in for a double run through . The album ended up on my MD player as well and stayed in it for two weeks before the debut album took over . What can I say ? I love the music.Only a couple of months ago I was thinking that music these days has stagnated . Once there was a time when you could date a song to the year just by the sound and style . Now 2009 sounds almost like 1999 . I gave up hope and spent most of my time in my 1968 to 1978 music collection . Wolfmother not only revive that sound and style of composing and playing but give it a shot to wake up the dead rock stars of the classic days of hard rock and metal.What I particularly like about this second album is the appearance of some mother heavy riffs that would leave Tony Iommi wondering why he had n't thought of them . The riff and sound is so heavy sometimes it seems even the distortion is weighed down and sluggish , and an image of a glacier bulldozing it 's way into downtown comes to mind.But it 's not all about knocking you senseless on your ass with heavy riffs . There 's plenty of straight out hard rock and ease back acoustic and piano in the very best of the classic sense . For a band whose front man talks about a rock show that 's just `` bang , bang , bang , bang , '' one song after another ( see their web site for the interview with Andrew Stockdale ) , they put a lot of effort into creativity and mood . The album is a rich menu of flavours.One other thing I appreciate on this album is that there is less of a Jack White vocal style ( though still prominent in some songs ) . At times I find myself thinking that Stockdale 's vocals resemble a young Ozzy in tone but with power coming closer to ( but not equivalent to ) a young Robert Plant.Overall , this album is a high four stars for me .

Only Andrew Stockdale remains from the original trio and officially asserts himself as the main man in the band here . With new members in tow this version of Wolfmother is a leaner , meaner music machine with a wider variety of material in it 's repertoire . The band still take their sound from 70 's era hard rock with elements of Sabbath , Zeppelin , Deep Purple , and Uriah Heep surfacing throughout the disc . They also occasionally mine more pop oriented fare with comparisons to Cheap Trick , Oasis or even The Beatles to be found . What all of these influences boil down to , is a modern version of classic rock done really really well . Yea , it has all been done before , but these guys do what they do so well that everything sounds fresh and invigorating . I truly enjoy the wide variety of music to be found on this disc , and find the material to be much more diverse that the band 's debut . `` White Feather '' is the only track on the disc that I do n't care for that much , but even it has grown on me with repeated listens . All in all , with the new lineup Wolfmother have improved over what was already a very solid band . To my ears this is one of the best heavy rock albums of 2009 and if you are into a somewhat retro inspired release it does not get much better than this . Sadly the album does not seem to have done as well here in the U.S. as the debut did . The album did not get a lot of airplay and seemed to have came and gone fairly quickly .

The lyrics occasionally slip into hippie-mysticism ( `` California Queen '' ) and Hendrixian Guitar Utopias ( the six minute `` Violence Of The Sun '' ) , but Wolfmother never fall into boredom . `` Cosmic Egg '' will make you hope they stay on this track and wonder if the next album cover will be a Frazetta painting ."}, "22906": {"id": "22905", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The heaviosity flows freely on this new Wolfmother album . ( Or is it heavitude ? ) But I like the fact that this is hard rock as opposed to Heavy Metal . In other words , it 's filled with loud and heavy electric guitars and high-register lead vocals , but the songs do n't bludgeon listeners into submission . For one thing , there 's a variety in tempos on the Egg -- it 's not all freight train , sometimes it 's a limo . I hear some of what one of the other reviewers described as `` more Sabbath than Zep '' on the album , in songs like `` 10000 Feet , '' but I still hear some Zeppelin in several of the songs too . My take on these homages to past `` rock gods '' is that Wolfmother maintains its originality while incorporating elements that worked so well for great genre bands in previous decades . It 's something I liked about Wolfmother before , and I 'm still enjoying it with this new incarnation.Regarding the Deluxe Edition , it 's interesting to me that the one-CD version has 12 songs on the disc , but when they added the 4 extra tracks for the Deluxe set , they decided to split up the songs 8 and 8 ( eight tracks on each CD ) .

Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel , on the other hand , is so bland that for the first time I found myself having trouble getting through one of her albums !

I thought that Mariah doing an album of slow jams would be great next-step for her . But truth be told , every song sounds exactly the same . In fact , `` Obsessed '' , `` H.A.T.E.U . `` , `` Languishing '' and `` I Want To Know What Love Is '' are the only standout tracks on this album of 17 tracks.The album sounds like it needed more time .

I thought after her emancipation her CDs would be getting better and better , but lately she has been going way too mainstream and lazy as a matter of fact when it comes to her voice .

She went from using touching & profound lyrics to the EXACT opposite of that . `` MC '' uses improper Grammar all through this album , Double Negatives , Sentence Fragments , Run-ons and the whole bit . I 've also noticed Mariah purposely using a subtle speech impediment in some songs on certain words to put the cherry on top of her ghetto-ness and give it that `` hood appeal '' , Which by the way was nowhere to be found on anything prior to her `` Emancipation '' .Yes ! We all know Mariah has had a few Hip-Hop songs in her career that you could count on your fingers . The only thing Hip-Hop about those songs were the beats , and then again the beats were subtle . Now it 's the lyrics along with her pronunciation of the words she 's uttering ... .Pathetic.The music itself is ( again ) '' Predictable '' , annoying & boring . The beats are so commercial and overproduced . It does n't take an outstanding vocalist to sing anything she has on this album . These are all the kinds of songs you expect from The Pussycat Dolls , Monica , Brandy , Ciara , Cassie , Danity Kane , Teirra Marie , Jordin Sparks , Kristinia Debarge , Mya , and anyone else that you know who 's music sounds the same . Notice how the ladies i 've mentioned are all half Mariah 's age , These girls were in kindergarten or baby strollers when she was where they are now . Moving right along.The only subjects `` MC '' covers is inner city relationships gone wrong between `` Boy & Girl '' sang over tacky bump-n-grind styled RNB with Hip-Hop qualities that rowdy Highschool and College aged kids will sing-along to with their cliques at lunchtime and on the back of the public service bus . I really believed Mariah was more evolved than this.After giving it a lot of thought , I truly believe this kind of music is MC 's get-out-of-jail-free-card . Her voice is withering year after year and I know she 's not proud about that . Reading all the Negative but TRUTHFULL comments about herself online posted by her true and honest fans has most likely taken a toll on her psychologically because she knows what 's true and what 's not . A lot of the comments about her singing has confirmed her own beliefs of it . Therefore she 's more than likely just numb to it all and crams junk like this together . Which would explain this disaster.On a brighter note there `` IS '' one track in particular that I continue playing over and over and it 's the 2:33 Interlude `` Languishing '' which brings back memories of the true Mariah Carey . `` Languishing '' is remeniscent of songs such as `` Petals '' `` Twister '' & `` Sunflowers For Alfred Roy '' . Yes ! It sounds like the stuff Mariah has done again and again but can you ever actually get enough of it ? `` Languishing '' Has a beautiful and touching melody with `` Real '' lyrics . `` I Wan na Know What Love Is '' is a poor imitation of her older side , What ruins this song the most is not only her singing but the beat , She gave it a NEW generation bump .

And watch all the Muse fans click `` unhelpful review '' because I hurt them.Uprising is an ugly pop song . It tries to compensate for its lack of energy with superficial clapping and pointless shouting ( `` hey '' , '' Come on '' ) . I cringe when Matt tries to fire up his audience with cries about `` us '' and `` them '' . Its cheap and souless . The Dr Who theme is predictable of muse , the reptition is dissapointing but what really makes this sell out song terrible is that its not even good enough to be on radio . Within the confines of a pop instrumental , Matt 's wailing voice sounds way too melodramatic and whiny.The intro of Resistance could almost be superimposed with Citizen Erased . A rehash of old work . Resistance on the other hand is so bland melodically . And just in case you could be wrong the cheesy chorus makes sure you 're right . It goes absolutely nowhere . Never builds , never changes , never climaxes.And since Absolution , Matt has had this undisclosed desire to make mainstream music . Its obvious , as with every new album there is the inclusion of at least one hideously dumbed down track . Enter this Timbaland jingle which proceeds to cling to one idea , beating and spanking it . I 'll admit the melody is actually catchy , but its paperthin . Im not totally against this sound , I just dont see the point unless Muse evolve it into something more unique.Enter United States of Eurasia . You know it was kind of cool for muse to be thought of as the new Queen , but then to seal the deal with this blatant imitation is emabarrasing . It is pornographic in nature . Lyrically inept , completely literal in every sense with a rehash of past melodies . Predictable angular transitions but this time it feels like novelty.And roll in with Lawrence of Arabia thematics ... Lights camera action people . While I was once a great admirer of Muse 's bombastic pompous sound , its potently staged here . Its like a Walt Disney ride where you realise the scenery is just wallpaper and the walls are made of styrofoam.Guiding Light is a slow bellowing ballad in the way of songs like Blackout and Sing for Absolution from their earlier album . And as one can imagine from the cliche title its a self indulgent rompfest of eurotrash one liners . iIts romance as stale as cardboard cutouts , which fizzles out somewhere after the guitar solo anyway.Unnatural selection proves that muse are somewhat throwing music at us any which way . Opening with organs , but why and with what purpose . The whole soundscape is just hot air , and subsequently the whole track lacks any real emotion . I hear a band like Arcade Fire ( intervention ) put to use the organ and one feels like it has purpose , like it opens ones palate the way good wine does during a main meal . But this song is just a pile of little league ideas . Matt even manages to sneak in a System of a Down-esque wallow which is insulting.MK Ultra follows like Map of the Problematique . Opens with a pacey guitar jingle which sounds pretty cool but it suffers from a lack of variation and ultimately swallows itself whole into nothingness . A general theme in this whole album . And of course the guitar solo at the end is a rehash from live gigs . Are these guys getting lazy or are they trying ever so hard to be on radio . They dont do anything daring with it , all the while sounding completely ordinary.I belong to you is probably Muse 's best love ballad to date . Its something that might belong on Showbiz if they did that album again . Bouncy bassline and Matt 's splintered angst . But its an interesting track which manages to change sounds repeatedly and all the while paints a rich landscape of sounds.Exogenosis is not the saving grace . Although it is in another league compared to the rest of the album its still not the mammoth symphony I was hoping for . Its really just a rehash of sounds they 've done before , including Microcuts , Butterflies and Hurricanes . Other parts are familiar melodies sourced from cinema . It is wonderous and I admire it in a lo-fi way but Im disappointed because Muse had the potential to really do something special with this . Butterflies and Hurricanes alone feels more grand and daring than this 15 minute symphony . And while Exogenosis does have the impact of making you feel like your riding the magic carpet through sands of history , it never overwhelms you with any climatic explosions or exotic delights . Part 3 Redemption makes for a beautiful melody , I cant help but take it literally ... `` lets start it over again '' .But for all my criticisms it comes down to the simple fact that this album is not enjoyable . Its ok but its not great in the way I would want to listen to a particular song again and again.There was a reason Muse resonated with me so much in the past , but to see them now make music that is universally non-offending , accessible to all ears , and is deliberately simple to capture the short attention of passers-by ( at walmart , in the elevator , at work , while commuting ) will not satisfy someone like me who makes the effort to actively listen to the album.

Again the repetitive chorus of `` you build me up , you burn me down '' would fit perfectly on some Sandra Bullock romantic comedy sountrack.The third highlight on the disk for me is the sixth track `` Simple Stone '' . This is probably my favorite song on the disk , simply because of the bass line in the tune . It 's got a funky , late 70 's vibe going on . The only problem with the tune , it that during the opening and during the chorus , there is this high-pitched keyboard whine that borders on a sound only dogs can hear . On a car stereo it 's not too bad , but I imagine on an Ipod it would sound like a dentist 's drill scraping at your eardrums.The final acoustic number `` People in the mountains , People of the oceans '' also is n't a bad song , but clocking in at about a minute and a half , it 's more like a songlet than an actual tune.The rest of the songs found here are basically interchangeable . All with a fairly mellow sound , that is n't bad as background music , but nothing to write home about . My guess is that in the coming months you 'll hear a tune or two off of `` Sunshower '' as the background to some commercial hocking toothpaste or jeans , and if you like it ... great click on the link above and buy it ... .but I do n't recommend buying the whole album ."}, "22938": {"id": "22937", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I found this band to have potential to be a good alternative pop band .

Jupiter One 's `` Sunshower '' is derivative and strangely hollow . The music is constructed of spare parts left over from other bands , particularly the Flaming Lips . Musically , they seem to know how to play their instruments , which is a plus . Not a note or a harmony out of place.Or perhaps I should say , their producer can edit things together to where it sounds like they know how to play their instruments . The reason I say that last is because there is a falseness , a hollowness , to Jupiter One 's music that I ca n't precisely define . Their music gives the illusion of substance but when I really listen to it , it dissolves into its derivatives and disappears . The lyrics vary between I-love-you rubbish and incomprehensibility , always seeming like they 're going to say something enlightening , but they never really make it . The music is the same ; it almost seems like something is going to happen , but it never does.Jupiter One 's `` Sunshower '' is clever in a completely vacuous way . It gives the illusion of being memorable pop , but their hooks do n't stick in the brain and their songs do n't return to haunt me . `` Sunshower '' is a candy bar ; sweet for a moment , empty calories , made by a corporation , and in the final analysis , not all that good for you . The best thing about the CD is ultimately the cover , which is peculiar enough to almost be art . The rest of it ? Not so much.Finally , I find it very odd that their promotional material mentions the producer when the production itself is so poor . I have to be honest . The sound is muddy and ill-mixed , and nobody should be proud of the production , engineering or mixing on this album . The dynamics of the music are muddled and nothing sounds as if it were recorded right , or well .

Jimi has been `` remastered '' now so many times its a joke ! The catalog first came out on CD in 1990 on reprise records and they sounded like shiet ! Then they were very quickly re-mastered , actually within just months of their intitial release , they were deemed so horrible that they were quickly remastered and resold with just a small sticker on the box ( they had CD 's in long narrow boxes then ) the sticker just said `` remaster '' . This wasnt a true remaster but a quicky job using some system called `` sonic solutions '' , a way to remove static and such from the songs , but thats about it , but still big improvment . Also to be noted , Electric ladyland was originally released as a 2 CD set , the remaster changes it to 1 CD . Then in 1993 when Alan Douglas moved to the MCA label , they were agian re-mastered and given new CD covers ( dumb idea ) they all looked liked the `` Voodoo Soup '' ill fated CD cover . Those were true remasters and said to use the original mater tapes . Then in 1997 Al and Janie Hendrix wins there lawsuit over Alan Douglass and all the CD 's were once again remastered , just 2 stupid years later ! The gimmick this time was they went back to the original mix down tracks and remastered from those plus as well as brought back the original artwork . Then now they move to sony/legacy and what do they do ... .. ? ? ? REMASTER the songs ... ... get real ! Then after all that is said ... .++ PLUS I can say this : VOODOO CHILD ( Slight return ) is STILL NOT remastered correctly ! I have this on the original Reprise records vinyl . Voodoo Child starts out with a `` hum '' or `` buzz '' in the background , prob from Jimi 's amp and it starts out in the left speaker and comes into both speakers within 4 seconds , the buzz tho is heard until the song kicks in after the intro.The song does NOT fade at all but sounds more like the tape running out . Now this song even had 1 more remaster ( if you can believe that ! ) In 1985 reprise released `` Kiss the Sky '' a greatest hits and was the very first album to have remastered Jimi songs on it and I first noticed this botch back then , infact the song fades out early and is a few seconds shorter than the original mix put out in 1968 . Let me hear it the way Jimi approved it in 1968 with all it 's inperfections.Im just sick of record companies making a huge splash over remastering , you listen to this and listen to the 1997 remaster ... ... the diff is well ... ... you cant tell . many have said these are the same 1997 remasters bogusily being resold as new , whereas some say they are new ... .whatever the case , its not justifying buying the new cd ... ..or with the crumy DVD promo film you get with it .

Not a good release ."}, "22988": {"id": "22987", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "When Slash left Guns N ' Roses in 1996 , many GNR fans have impatiently waited and demanded another `` Appetite for Destruction '' . When Slash , Duff and Matt Sorum got together with Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland to form the supergroup Velvet Revolver , there was a sigh of relief among rock fans that they will get the music that they desired for . Finally , a real hard rock band in the age of Creed and Nickelback . Of course , never mind the fact thatsome of therock bandswere alreadydelivering thatkind of musicat the time . Apparently , those guysweren'thard rockenough for these fans.Unfortunately , Velvet Revolver proved to be a failure - uninspired music , lackluster songwriting and a strong lack of chemistry between the frontman and the music players . It did n't take a brain surgeon to know that having Scott Weiland play with Slash was like havingChris Cornell work with Timbaland . So in the span of four years , Weiland was no longer in the band , everyone pursued solo projects and Velvet Revolver went into hiatus , still without a frontman to this day . The saviors of rock n ' roll , ladies and gentlemen.But shortly after Weiland 's departure , Slash made an announcement that he and his friends were going to create a good , old-fashioned rock n ' roll album a la `` Appetite '' , one that he was unable to make during his final days with Axl Rose . And since Axl did n't deliver that kind of album , many fans point their hopes on Slash to deliver a worthy successor to that towering masterpiece of hard rock . It also helped that Slash recruited some of the best and best-loved icons of rock , - the lead singer of Motorhead , the prince of darkness Ozzy Osbourne , the alternative rock gods Chris Cornell and Dave Grohl , the godfather of punk Iggy Pop - some newcomers such as Black Eyed Peas vocalist Fergie , Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine and Avenged Sevenfold singer M. Shadows - and , most of all , the three former members of GNR . Seriously , how could it all go wrong ? Well , everything - music , lyrics , creativity , production . Moreso than the Velvet Revolver albums , there is not an ounce of inspiration and creativity in these fourteen lackluster tracks . Most of these songs are boring rehashes of 80s hard rock cliches , some that were best forgotten . How depressing is it to hear the likes of Ozzy Osbourne , Iggy Pop , Kid Rock and Chris Cornell waste their considerable gifts in singing such hackneyed , trite lyrics ? How discouraging is it that given the talent involved , you 're left feeling empty and unfulfilled ? Think about it for a second - you have an album by Slash that consists of Dave Grohl , Iggy Pop , Ozzy Osbourne , Chris Cornell , Kid Rock , Lemmy , Fergie and the three former members of Guns N ' Roses - and it still blew . Imagine `` A Momentary Lapse of Reason '' replacing David Gilmour with Slash and you pretty much got the picture.I wanted so badly to like this album , but I came out of it feeling short-changed . When not even Izzy Stradlin could take a dull hard rocker like `` Ghosts '' and bring it to life , you know you 're in trouble . Unfortunately , that 's just the tip of the iceberg . Most of the other tracks are guilty of bad quality , starting with `` Crucify the Dead '' , which may rank as one of Ozzy Osbourne 's worst vocal performances . A lifeless power ballad where the Ozzman takes a blatant shot at Axl Rose ( `` A gun jammed with a rose '' . How original ) , `` Crucify the Dead '' is proof that the Prince of Darkness and sentimentality do not mix . The next track `` Beautiful Dangerous '' , featuring Fergie , is better , but not much . Fergie is in good form , but she 's no match for the song 's ridiculous lyrics ( `` And that 's when I spin on the pole/Now my head 's exploding and your gun is loaded/So I 'm guessing I 'm on a roll '' What the hell ? ) and sludge of processed guitar riffs and bland keyboards . I thought this was a good , old-fashioned rock n ' roll album ? The rest of the tracks are hardly `` Smooth '' with Rob Thomas . `` Back From Cali '' is cut-rate AC/DC rip-off featuring the ever-derivative Myles Kennedy sounding like a haphazard cross of Bruce Dickinson , Geddy Lee and Robert Plant . `` I Hold On '' , feat . Kid Rock , is a retread of far superior Kid Rock ballads such as `` Lonely Road of Faith '' , `` Picture '' and `` Cold and Empty '' . `` Promise '' , feat . Chris Cornell , sounds like a weakly crafted demo from the Soundgarden basement . and `` Nothing to Say '' begins as a promising Sabbath-like epic , but disintegrates into a tedious speed metal track featuring forced singing by the usually talented M. Shadows.The most tolerable songs on this album are `` Gotten '' feat . Adam Levine ; `` Doctor Alibi '' feat . Lemmy ; and the instrumental `` Watch This Dave '' , with appearances by Duff McKagan and drummer Dave Grohl . The former is a warm love song where Adam Levine brings life to half-baked lyrics and the latter two tracks have a momentum and fervent energy that is sadly missing from the rest of the album . Depressingly , these songs would be considered expendable in these artists ' music catalogs.The greatest disappointment , however , is the production . For an album aspiring to be like `` Appetite for Destruction '' , I have never heard such a clean , polished sound . If it was raw , sloppily produced a la `` New York Dolls '' , `` Raw Power '' or `` In Utero '' , perhaps the album 's music would probably sound better than it is , but the refined Eric Valentine and Big Chris Flores production really suck the life out of these songs , making the songs ' deficiencies more blatant and obvious.As stated earlier , I wanted to like this album a lot ; my love for Guns N ' Roses is immeasurable . Unfortunately , albums like `` Slash '' prove that what these band members could n't do alone what they did together . Despite the star-studded cast , `` Slash '' failed to make a dent at the Billboard charts and the gap of talent between Slash and Axl more obvious . Slash is an extremely talented guitarist , but without a songwriter like Axl or even Izzy , he 's lost in making hackneyed mediocrities like this.If Slash wants to get cozy with his buddies and play uninspired rehashes of `` Nightrain '' , `` Sweet Child O'Mine '' or `` Locomotive '' , then he 's welcome to it . Unfortunately , this album will only serve as an unintentional reminder that no matter what kind of person he was , Axl Rose was clearly the writer.Far from being `` Supernatural '' , Slash 's solo album is a super bore.Strong recommendation to avoid ."}, "22989": {"id": "22988", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Coheed and Cambria 's neverending saga set to prog-rock music that sounds more and more like Rush gets more and more annoying each album ."}, "22990": {"id": "22989", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I 've read a lot of positive reviews of this album , claiming that Coheed had ripped off Rush and Iron Maiden in their previous records , and that this may be the most `` them '' album yet .

Every track feels out of place in the cotext of the one before it . The only tune on this disc that sounds like it fits on a Coheed disc is When Skeletons Live , and even that track sounds out of place , like they had to rush in a track that sounds like old Coheed . The best tune on the album , This Shattered Symphony , Has an amazing opening and chorus , but is ruined by a totally lame part before the chorus .

World of Lines sounds like they took the boring parts of No Prayer For The Dying , and threw them into one song.I ca n't even stomach Here We Are Juggernaut , with the chorus being amazing and everything else being cringe worthy .

I love Prog . I do n't love it when a band forces everything into a Blender at once , thus creating a pretentious mix that is as cringe worthy as it gets.Also , the lyrics are disastrous . I remember when their lyrics not only told a story but were very painful and had you relating . Here they 've clearly taken a step back in that department . `` Rain down fire and BUUUUUUURN US AAAAAAALLLLLLLLL ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' ugh , seriously ? I am all for angry lyrics but this is just stupid.Look , Coheed are much better than this . They have TALENT . They can actually write tunes .

That 's the sole purpose of this album . But the eclectic creativity of System is long gone , and the song writing is below that of the worst elevator music . This is just aural filler for CPAs and yuppies to host baby showers and provide inoffensive background music for staid corporate events . Even the lyrics suck ( ? ! ) because they are so direct . Direct is n't interesting , it 's boring and talentless . The best lyrics are veiled and open to interpretation , as Seal has done so well in the past.But Seal did this on purpose . System proved he can still write great melodies , and is ( was ? ) willing to dare to grow and try new collaborators .

Back before the Yeah Yeah Yeah 's debut . Back before weird was normal . Remember how good Luv Machine was when it came out in 1998 ? It was almost as if someone threw Yo La Tengo , The Ex , Sonic Youth , The Pixies and Bjork in a blender . Twin brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace seemed so cool and wise , and when they stood on stage with Japanese singer Kazu Makino , there was nothing more New York . They were at once romantic and rocking - not an easy thing to do . They were the art stars back when we did n't call rockers art stars , making the scene as quietly as anyone of recent memory . Sexy , smart and creative , all three of 'em.I get it , bands change . That 's cool , but how a band like Blonde Redhead goes from experimental to promising and polished pseudo-prog to the so-called left field pop of their new record is beyond me . How can the band that made the Can-friendly In an Expression of the Inexpressible with Fugazi 's Guy Picciotto make Penny Sparkle , an indie-pop record for the Gaga Gag Generation ? I just do n't get it . I suppose many will call Penny some sort of Bjorkian hustle , but that just seems to obvious to me . Anyone who hears this record should be painfully aware of how hard the Redheads are trying to get some Pitchforkian-type love . You know , that sweet , fickle right now kind of love that the kids are so hot for in 2010.The one promising thing about this , the band 's eighth proper studio record in 15 years , is that it sees the trio again working to do something they 've not done before . The last two Blonde Redhead albums , 2004 's Misery Is a Butterfly and 2007 's 23 felt phoned in , especially when you consider how inventive they 'd been on their first five records . But , I suppose , with Penny Sparkle we do n't get a bad record , but we do n't really get a Blonde Redhead record . We get what feels like a Bjork-meets-Goldfrapp experimental version of chamber pop . It almost feels as if the Redheads made their album after watching Sophia Copolla 's Lost In Translation twelve times in a row . The vibe is still sexy , but the rock is gone . There 's atmosphere and mood , but it just does n't work as well . The dreamy tunes , like `` Love Or Prison , '' `` My Plants Are Dead '' and the uber-mellow - and Radiohead-friendly - title track are pretty great , but not quite good enough to make up for stinkers like `` Spain , '' `` Here Sometimes '' and the very Yeasayer-like `` Will There Be Stars . `` All that said , the record almost has the feel of a debut ; which I gather is the point . Let 's hope this mellow , guitar-absent , young-ear-loving version of one of the best NYC rock bands of the 90s is just a quick misstep . Their NYC Ghosts & Flowers , if you will . Because if this is the Blonde Redhead we have to look forward to , we may as well stick a fork in 'em .

I also loved Paul Banks solo album as well . But my initial feeling of this album is that it was very hard for me to enjoy . As far as I could tell this album is completely lacking catchy choruses ( just really repetative ones ) or enjoyable guitar arrangements of any sort . Now I am far from the type that wants things radio friendly , but sounded like maybe the most un-catchy batch of songs I have heard in a while . I guess it is kind of the aquivalent of like an abstract Sci-fi film that does n't make any sense , and is not very enjoyable , just somewhat interesting because it is so wierd and different from anything else . Obviously Interpol have always been kind of cold and distant sounding , because that is the type of music this band makes ( ex . Joy Division ) , but to me all their previous albums still had a pulse and a heartbeat . This one to me sounds dead on arrival . No emotion or feeling what so ever . And there are a couple of tracks that I thought were going to give me an aneurysm ... specifically the song `` Always Malaise '' , which in my opinion is one of the worst songs I 've heard in a while . Maybe I am being too harsh here , but I 'm not just trying to be a hater . But I was really looking forward to this album , and to only like maybe three songs out of the 10 is quite dissapointing . Then again maybe I should look at this in a Kid A kind of way and realize it is not meant to be enjoyed like a traditional album and try to appreciate it for what it is . Like I said in the beginning , I hope this is a grower . Here is the quick four star rating breakdown of how I feel about these songs:1 ) Success = 4/4 ( pretty good , sounds like old interpol and is more like what I wanted the whole album to sound like.2 ) Memory Serves = 3/4 ( Decent , but starting to drift into the tone deaf wasteland of the rest of the album ) 3 ) Summer Well = 1/4 ( I could find no enjoyment in this song whatsover ) 4 ) Lights = 4/4 ( Easily the best album on here , even if the guitar riff is extremely repetative . But sounds like the Interpol of old ) 5 ) Barricade = 2/4 ( Somewhat decent first single , but could not really find anything that makes it stand out as being Interpol ) 6 ) Always Malaise = 0/4 ( One of the worst songs ever . Eventually turns into the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard ) 7 ) Safe Without = 1/4 ( starts out okay , then goes downhill like the rest ) 8 ) Try it on = 3/4 ( The other song that I actually liked on here ) 9 ) All of the ways = 2/4 ( Decent but overall boring ) 10 ) The Undoing = 1/4 ( boring from the get-go )"}, "23021": {"id": "23020", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Bands use the self-titled album as a means of telling their fans that they 're going back to basics , that this album will rediscover what made the band great in the first place . That 's almost assuredly what Interpol wished to communicate by releasing a self-titled album after their critically derided Our Love to Admire . Unfortunately , despite whatever good intentions , Interpol 's latest fails to live up to the promise of their first two moody and exhilarating albums.Interpol starts off promising with `` Success , '' a song built almost entirely upon their muscular rhythm section . However , by the second song , `` Memory Serves , '' many of the album 's reoccurring weaknesses quickly become apparent . Like much of the album , `` Memory Serves , '' relies too heavily on a feeble and repetitive chorus that lead singer , Paul Banks , strains to sell like he 's some sort of low level stock broker . Lyrically the album trades in the sort of over worn love loss that mistakes clich & eacute ; s for directness . In `` Summer Well '' Banks pleads , `` I miss you babe / I want you back , '' and as a listener I can only think to myself , `` Who cares ? '' Interpol have never been known for their lyrical prowess , but on their first two albums you could count on them to use obtuse abstraction now and again to set the mood.That 's not to say that Interpol does n't have its good moments . The orchestration on `` Always Malaise '' and the piano on `` Try it On '' point to a fuller sound that still might reinvigorate the band . Unfortunately , even the interesting sonic tricks on Interpol are buried under thick production that flattens any dynamics in their sound . These are n't songs , they 're mosquitoes frozen in amber . The front cover of Interpol shows the band 's name in a state of deconstruction .

And looking at some of these reviews , I was right.Never a huge Linkin Park fan myself , I have gotten some enjoyment out of both Hybrid Theory and Meteora back in the day . This CD sounds nothing like those , it might as well be from a different band.That said , this review will not be complaining about that , exactly . I actually liked Minutes to Midnight , their previous CD , enough to have rated it 5 stars ( ! ) when it came out , which surprises me , but that was my opinion back then so I 'll stick with it.Most fans seemed to have been underwhelmed with Minutes to Midnight , finding its softer rock style to be a huge departure from the Nu-metal band they knew and loved . These people are not going to be won over by A Thousand Suns , which seems to totally ignore the vast fan complaints about that CD 's new sound.I do n't want this to be `` that type '' of review . I understand that bands change , their interests change , their style changes , etc . I was fine with this on Minutes to Midnight , which was , I think everyone would agree , still a rock album . Well , A Thousand Suns is not . I do n't know what I 'd even call it , to be honest . Techno hip hop at times , `` boy band '' soft at others ... .but basically , you ca n't even hear much guitar presence here , it 's all been covered over by a synthesizer . The songs are all for the most part mid-tempo ( The Catalyst is the fastest song on the CD , amazingly enough ) and there are only about 9 songs on this CD ... .the other 6 are either clips of speeches or synthesized interludes between songs . At times these can be atmospheric and interesting , at other times , they come off as pretentious and pointless . Having to wait till track 3 to get to the first real song on an album is never a good thing . And this is especially a problem when one of these songs is as unbelievably awful as The Messenger , the album closer , which features Chester howling over an accoustic guitar about how `` love keeps us kind . '' Ugh . Waiting for the End is a mixed bag that I ca n't tell if I love or hate . Same with Robot Boy.Elsewhere , Iridescent is an effective balad , Burning in the Skies is okay , but it sounds like a Minutes to Midnight throwaway . Wretches and Kings is a cool Linkin Park meets Public Enemy type of song , When They Come For Me is pretty solid , Blackout 's very good , and of course The Catalyst is great ... but that 's about the best the CD gets . Taken as a whole ( as the CD is meant to be ) it 's definitely an interesting listen , despite the terrible final song that will make fans beg for Little Things Give You Away , Numb , and Pushing Me Away . Taking each song and looking at it individually , though , these are some of the band 's weakest to date , despite some cool parts to each and innovative ideas , none of the songs manages to leave much of an impression . All go on for too long.It 's interesting that Linkin Park decided to release a CD that could potentially alienate their entire fanbase . They say in the booklet that they 're aware of this , but that they 're doing this because this is the type of CD they want to release . That 's all admirable , I just wish this CD was a bit better . It 's got some solid tracks and some very cool and effective moments . It 's also got lots of aimless techno filler and the move AWAY from rock music almost entirely is disappointing to me . This is Linkin Park , is n't it ? I love when bands experiment and try to broaden their sound . But then there 's when it 's a case of too much of this , like here , when the simple fact is that this should have been a solo album , or a side project , or something . This CD bearing the Linkin Park name just does n't feel right . I thought Minutes to Midnight was a good effort on the band 's part to broaden their sound and release more subtle and more `` adult '' rock . I could see what they were trying to do . This CD , though , except the rap songs , sounds more like Phil Collins than Linkin Park . I 'm not sure at all what the band was trying to do here . And it 'll further alienate fans.Myself ? It 's listenable . I bought a copy so I could have it in my discography and I can see myself listening to it a few times . But for many fans , it 's probably a sign of the end of the Linkin Park they grew up listening to . And if the band continues in this direction , I just do n't think they can compete against the artists it seems that they 're trying to compete against , so it might be the start of the fall of the band , too . Which is kind of too bad , because they have talent . Again , musical experimentation is good ... totally and completely ignoring your fans ' complaints about your previous CD ... not good .

There are electronic interludes between nearly all of the songs , and they do n't really connect the songs , making them almost non-sequiters . Of the 15 tracks , only nine are actual songs , and many of those ( such as `` Catalyst '' ) sound more experiments rather than fully developed songs . When the songs do develop , they lack the strength of the better moments of their previous work . `` Robot Boy '' sounds like One Republic covering Oasis ' `` Wonderwall . `` `` Iridescent '' picks up melodically where `` Leave Out All the Rest '' left off , but never really gets going . `` Wretches and Kings '' is a brilliant track , combining all the great elements of MTM with their early hits . But all in all , this album is somewhat of a missed opportunity .

It 's a bunch of whiny techno idiocy . Why this band gets so much credit is beyond me . This has to be their worse album yet . Should have seen it coming , with the dreadful Minutes To Midnight ."}, "23027": {"id": "23026", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This album proved to be too difficult for repeated spins . While I do appreciate an album that takes time to sink in ( some of my favorite albums were those that i did n't initially like , but ended up growing on me due to the complex nature of them ) A Thousand Suns comes up short in the memorable song department.The issue with A Thousand Suns for me is that it does n't seem to flow at all . It has too many idea 's floating around in its head to be a complete thought . Many may say that I just do n't get it , and to give it more time , the problem is I really do n't enjoy it as a whole , save a few memorable moments . There are good idea 's here and there , and some great musical moments , but they tend to always meander off in some unrelated direction once they get interesting.Case and point , `` Waiting for the World to End '' , this song has a fantastic bridge/verse that appears with Chester singing throughout . This part of the song is fantastic , actually it may be one of my favorite moments in Linkin Park 's discography . However , the strange rap/reggae portion of the song from Mike , just does n't flow with Chesters part at all , and ends up just being confusing . Actually , I ca n't figure out which is the chorus and which is the verse . It just seems like a connection of two unrelated songs , and forcing them to fit together.That 's kind of the way the album is as a whole . I like the idea of the album ( a complex concept album ) and I like some of the parts within , but its all very mixed up , cut and pasted , and the concept does n't come through , and I end up skipping around.I like Linkin Park , so this is not a critique of the band , as i have seen here on the reviews , i just feel that this project is a little to `` inside '' for the band . They had an idea in mind they built it , maybe it 's exactly what they planned , it 's just not very accessible to the public . Thats my take . I will say this though , the next album should be interesting if they take these types of ideas and sounds , and maybe use a different platform ."}, "23028": {"id": "23027", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I dont really listen to that much Rock music , but this CD is depressing as hell.Its not good music.I mean minutes to midnight is way better than this album ."}, "23029": {"id": "23028", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "When Hybrid Theory came out it was unique , different , and brilliant . Now having said that , LP do n't whine at me because I think Hybrid Theory and Meteora were wonderful but after 2 albums that sounded like disc one and two of the same album it was indeed time to move on . Then came Minutes to Midnight . I was a little put off by the album but it grew on me . Was n't the best by far , but it was decent . Transitional . But the new one , where to begin ... I 'll break it down track by track.1 . The Requiem - 4/5 This song actually is n't a song , but its separated so it gets a review . This is completely electronic with a humming in the background that sounds like gang vocals . Not a bad track actually , and ties in a lyric from towards the end of the album and actually helps to tie the album together well . Overall a decent opener that leads into ... 2 . The Radiance - 5/5 This song is exactly the same vein as the first , with one wonderful exception . I love the quote from Robert Oppenheimer . Other than that , this is still nothing special.3 . Burning in the Skies - 3/5 Decent track actually . Slow , haunting , different as it gets for the band . I honestly liked it.4 . Empty Spaces - 1/5 Crickets ... nuff said . Did n't need to be a track , could 've been a transitional tacked onto the last song.5 . When They Come For Me - 3/5 I 'm gon na place the score for this one in the middle because of how it felt for me . On one hand the song is odd and upbeat , with a beat to die for . Shinoda finally raps like he 's wanted to for so long . Fort Minor let him have his hip/hop outlet but this song really sounds like it belongs in the genre . Now onto the lyrics ... ugh . This song lyrically sounds like a massive slap in the face to fans who are n't enjoying this album and who were n't keen on Minutes to Midnight . LP , you have fans . They would 've stuck with you through changes if you 'd kept it worthwhile , but Minutes to Midnight was only ok and guess what ? They stuck with you . Then they say that ya , the third album was ok but the first two were better and what do you do ? You spit in their face . Is it really that big of a deal ? You ca n't please everyone boys ... 6 . Robot Boy - 4/5 I actually enjoyed this one . Strange sound but it was pleasing to the ears . I 'll be nice and stop here . Enjoy the track with the weirdest title on the album.7 . Jordana Del Muerto - 2/5 Yet ANOTHER instrumental . There are some lyrics sung in Spanish over the background though . Its haunting and alright , just not really that memorable . Nothing really wrong with it.8 . Waiting for the End - 5/5 For some reason I love this bloody song . So much fun , great sound , and overall decent impression . Probably the best track on the album.9 . Blackout - 1/5 Chester , you have a unique scream . I love it . Having said that , you misuse it here . Its butchered by the background music . I could 've stood this track a Capella instead.10 . Wretches and Kings - 2/5 This idea and sound sort of worked on When They Come For Me but yet another song about the American class system that actually makes them sound ignorant as successful musicians above the lower class they 're supposedly helping rise up ... come on boys ... 11 . Wisdom , Justice , and Love - 1/5 Another instrumental . Nothing against it , but it scores low because at this point in the album this is just getting ridiculous.12 . Iridescent - 4/5 Second favorite song on the album . A decent balance between band sound and electronics . Lyrics are alright as well . Nothing too epic but its a good song actually.13 . Fallout - 2/5 Another bloody instrumental , but the one thing that helps this track is that it contains a lyric from Burning in the Skies , tying the entire album back together.14 . The Catalyst - 1/5 Has decent ideas but just goes nowhere . I know I 'll receive flak for saying that , but its got too much Mr. Hahn , feels like a dance beat and not a song , and on top of that it sounds like they 're expecting people to shake it to the lyrics they wrote about nuclear destruction . The album had a great idea behind it , but this is the pinnacle of the poor execution behind it.15 . The Messenger - 3/5 I admit it , I kinda like the idea of acoustic Linkin Park . Its decent , but the lyrics are a little odd . They sound ... sort of like they were written in a rush.Other than some of the different lyrics it was alright.Well folks , there you go . Linkin Park 's new album is slightly disappointing and not really worth buying but as a die hard fan from back when I bought it , and I 'll buy the next one . Lets just hope they get over their 'vision ' and need to lash out at people who said they were better in the beginning because if they get past this they can start making real music again . Who knows , this next album they make could have a concept like A Thousand Suns , but be better executed .

This is nothing like you 've ever heard before from Linkin Park . And that 's not a good thing.I find this situation ironic . When I had initially heard that the band was changing their sound for their previous album , Minutes to Midnight I was dreading what the outcome was going to be and I ended up adoring that album . It 's probably my favorite album of their catalog . So naturally , I trusted the band when they said they were changing up their sound yet again.Big mistake . `` A Thousand Suns '' is a good example of what would happen if a history textbook mated with a turntable . Some tracks are instrumental . Some tracks have historical speeches set to something that sounds like the background music for a video game . I get that this album is supposed to be unconventional but it 's such a drastic departure from their previous sound that I am surprised this was not cut down to an LP and was actually released as a commercial album.Anyone who was as entranced as I was by the `` New Divide '' single from the Transformers soundtrack was waiting with baited breath for the new album . And a great deal of us felt let down . The `` New Divide '' single was an absolute masterpiece of both sound and lyrical content . `` A Thousand Suns '' sounds like it was compiled together in one weekend while on a bender.Some of the salvageable songs on this album , in my opinion , were `` Burning in the Skies '' , `` Waiting For the End '' , `` Wretches and Kings '' and `` Iridescent '' and these songs are `` meh '' at best . `` Burning in the Skies '' sounds like `` Valentine 's Day '' from Minutes to Midnight set to more of a Red Hot Chili Peppers beat . `` Waiting For the End '' has a hint of the Chester Bennington melancholy that we all know and love , but it 's still a bit of a sleeper . `` Wretches and Kings '' sounds a bit more industrial than techno but it 's still not necessarily noteworthy . `` Iridescent '' stands out , but not by much . Mike Shinoda shares vocals with Chester on this almost-ballad but it 's still not enough to reach out , grab me and make me proclaim it the best of these four.I strongly suggest that if you are interested in getting a copy of this album that you preview the tracks on iTunes or Amazon.com before you purchase it . `` A Thousand Suns '' will blind you if you purchase it unaware ."}, "23032": {"id": "23031", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Congratulations Linkin Park ! You just wiped off half your fanbase , I remember the good ol ' days when Hybrid Theory came out and LP was all over the TV , radio , shows , and when everyone was jamming to their music . Then Meteora came out , another rock solid album . They were at the top and hardly anyone had any complaints about their music - I still remember how awesome it was to speed in my car with their songs at max volume when I was a teenager . However few years ago , Minutes to Midnight came out , which was somewhat mediocre - some songs were a throwback to the older albums while some were just plain shocking - I felt as if I was listening to The Fray and All American Rejects ; nevertheless , it was still a decent CD that was worth the money . They rolled downhill with Minutes To Midnight and they literally fell off the cliff with Thousand Suns.This CD is extremely disappointing and the only good song that I really like is The Catalyst ( I love the live version at MTV 's VMAs ) .

But two experimental , far-out albums in a row , makes me think this band has already peaked , and run out of creative ideas.Chester 's voice is shot . I guess that 's what you get when you scream at the top of your lungs for 10 years . He 's tried to evolve into a rock singer , and he sucks . Sorry , Chester , but you do . Shinoda , what the hell happened to him ? He used to bring the flava ; intelligent rap verses , and he used to FLOW . Now , he 's a complete has-been . His rhymes are few and far between . He 's a singer now ? Come on . And when he does try to rap , he sounds pathetic.I ca n't imagine a bigger free fall than what Linkin Park has accomplished the last 2 albums . What a joke .

Their new album , The Final Frontier , is an example of maturation done RIGHT- They have n't gone soft or psychedelic.The two songs on this album that appeal are `` The Catalyst '' and `` The Messenger '' . The Catalyst is AMAZING . It 's basically the one track on here that comes as close to LP sounding as the album will get . The Messenger is an acoustic ballad similar to `` In Between '' on the MTM album , except this may actually be better.The rest is fail.This album should just be retitled `` An Hour of Musical Masturbation '' since that 's what it is . Too many electronica parts . There 's a few parts that make you think ALRIGHT , REAL LP TIME ! ! ! ! but then they last like 2 seconds each .

Although Meteora from 2003 basically continued in that vein , Linkin Park had to sink or swim ; since 2001 Korn and Limp Bizkit have suffered massive loss in sales , and Linkin Park was going to follow them down that path if they did n't adapt . In 2007 they released 'Minutes to Midnight ' , which was a major departure from their earlier sound . It was more ambitious and diverse . It was essentially a completely different style . Obviously LP were well educated on the low opinion of them in this post-Nu-Metal world.They have followed this up with 'A Thousand suns ' , which is a kind of social-conscious album that is full of statements . To understand WHY I give this album a low-rating , it 's worth comparing to an album almost 20 years ago by a hair-metal band ; 'Three sides to every story ' by 'Extreme ' . 'Extreme ' were labelled a hair-metal band in a grunge world that suddenly did n't like their style . They came out in 1992 with an ambitious album full of social commentary , including anti-war anthems . What also makes the two albums worth comparing is because on that album 'Extreme ' used a sample from a speeach by social activist Martin Luther King . 'A thousand suns ' uses three excerpts from activists ' speeches , including one from the same Martin Luther King . However there is one clear difference between the two.While 'Three sides to every story ' is a very well-thought out album that has a lot of meaning , 'A thousand sons ' does n't really mean anything . The lyrics have a lot big statements and emotion filled passages of sanctimony , but the overall meaning is often vague to the point of having no meaning at all . There 's a lot of complaint and discontent , which has always been a feature of Linkin Park music , but now that they 've cloaked themselves in Rage Against the Machine like activism , it 's even more frustrating that the lyrics really do n't amount to anything . And the music itself is a step-back from 'Minutes to Midnight ' . Genuine good song-writing and complexity , who showed their heads occasionally on the last album , have been replaced by a lot of effects and sampling . There are some good vocal harmonies here and there but that ca n't save songs that are desperately trying to cover their own lack of substance . That said , the songs 'Catalyst ' and 'The Messenger ' are genuinely high quality , 'The Messenger ' is particularly lovely.Shame really , I have been intrigued by these recent Linkin Park albums , since I have discovered them recently , because I thought there might be a Nu-Metal band that can come good , but 'A thousand suns ' is basically a meticulously and thoroughly crafted piece of crap .

He had one small radio hit with `` O Lets Do It '' and I thought well that 's it . Then over the summer he came strong with `` Hard In The Paint '' . Still did n't know it was him . By time `` No Hands '' was everywhere on the radio , I did n't know if it was his single or Wale 's ( I hoped it was Wale 's track ) When I heard his album title was `` Flockaveli '' I thought `` Hell Nah '' . Who is this young cat with no lyrics using the great Tupac 's name to get more publicity ? So of course it made me even more skeptical.The first thing I noticed was how much the beats sound like Rick Ross 's B.M.F . Then I found out that this album was produced by young producer Lex Luger ( who also produced Ross 's B.M.F & MC Hammer ) . His work is very impressive . The hardcore , bass thumping beats on `` Bustin ' At ` Em '' & the summer street banger `` Hard In The Paint '' remind me of a young Lil ' Jon . His beats lay the perfect background , too bad Flame is a horrible lyricist . I have n't heard a rapper say his name so much in a song since Mike Jones . His rhymes are cartoonish . It does n't take a musical genius to rhyme `` Flame '' & `` Mane '' . ( You can see the huge lyrical gap between Flame and Wale on `` No Hands '' ) The song titles tell you everything you need to know about the song . `` G Check '' , `` Bang '' & `` Smoke , Drank '' , lets you know there is nothing intelligent being said in these songs.Not since Young Jeezy 's `` Thug Motivation 101 '' , has a true gangsta , hardcore rap album came out . Theres no sing-along hooks , no sappy love songs & no auto tune . Just pure adrenaline rush beats that will keep your head bobbing for days . But you ca n't live off beats alone . You have to say something and that 's where Flame fails miserably . For the younger generation who do n't care about lyrics this will be their album of the year . But for the generation who grew up listening to the real Makaveli , this album will annoy you by the tenth track ."}, "23060": {"id": "23059", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "The best way for me to describe Waka Flocka Flame , much less this CD , is to compare it to Red Bull : Its chock full of energy and a lot of people like it , but its ultimately unsatisfying and too much of it is bad for you.Let me just say first off that despite my obvious biased , I gave this CD a listen . I really did , all 17 tracks . At the risk of being called a Waka hater , I was really not feeling this CD , and that is an understatement of epic proportions . Music is an art form and there is no right way to express yourself through it , and despite how I feel about this dude 's music in general , I have been hearing people talking about this CD a lot for the last week or so , and I decided to see if everyone else was seeing something I 'm not . For the life of me , I cant figure out this guy 's appeal.Waka suffers from what I call Same Song Syndrome ( SSS ) ; a very common disease among many mainstream rappers where they will make one catchy song , then replicate that song several times but alter the beat and lyrics slightly and call it an album . I will concede however , that the production on this album is pretty decent in the sense that it does n't sound like something a kid made in his room with Frooty Loops basic . Money was spent to make this dude sound good . The sound clearly draws heavily from the short lived Crunk movement , as well as the general syth sound heard in most mainstream southern rap , giving it that pumped up fight music feel . Unfortunately , thats about as high a praise as I can really give Flockaveli , because as much as people want to try and downplay the importance of lyrics in hip hop , they do make a difference.Waka keeps it very simple : his sub genre of Hip Hop is Gangsta Rap , therefore he raps about doing a bunch of `` gangsta '' stuff . Throughout the entire CD , every song , save for `` F**k This Industry '' is about busting gats , riding on enemies , robbing , stealing , haters , making money , and fighting . Sadly , the people expected nothing more of his music , but thats another topic . Because he is so simplistic in his subject matter and lyrical ability , he is easily accessible to anyone who wants to listen to him , but anyone who likes to hear about more then one thing for an hour will quickly grow tired of Waka 's monotony . `` For My Dawgs '' , `` F**k This Industry '' and maybe `` No Hands '' are the only examples of a 17 track album of any type of attempt at something to change it up . But clearly , thats not what Waka is going for ; he 's keeping it `` real '' on Flockaveli , and apparently this is all he knows.Another things to beware of about this album : do not mistaken being `` raw and energetic '' with having talent . One of the most consistent things I have heard people saying about Flockaveli is that `` he is so raw with it ! Its so full of energy , and blah blah blah '' . While the album is full of energy ( thanks mainly to the production ) as far as him keeping it raw ... please . Enumerable gangsta rappers past and present have done it better.Lastly , ***gets up on soapbox*** I have to express my dislike for this CD for the content . I dont think there are too many people who can and will defend Waka making positive music . He 's not , point blank . This is music to blast in your car when you just want to be loud and energized , nothing more . Come on people , lets call a Spade a Spade and be done with it , Waka Flocka Flame is by no stretch of the imagination a good music maker . Dont give him points because he 's a half-booty artist doing half-booty work . But at the end of the day , your going to like you want , so if you feel the need to drop ten bucks on Fozzy Bear here , go for it . You 'll be getting your money 's worth for years to come ***rolls eyes and gets off soapbox***"}, "23061": {"id": "23060", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "How does one review this album ? From beginning to finish , there is not one track that you 're going to skip . Theres nothing horrible here . However , theres not one track that you 're going to want to skip ahead to , either . This album does n't have a `` Satellite '' , `` Fa Fa '' , `` Happier '' or `` Careful '' thats going to pull you in . It also does n't have a `` Ruby Falls '' or a `` Come Downstairs and Say Hello '' as an epic ballad . This is an album full of twelve songs that pretty much do n't TAKE ANY CHANCES . They are all mid tempo , three minute pop songs . They all sound very much alike , and it 's a bit of a shame . Songs like these have always been on Guster albums , but for every `` C'mon '' , there was always something like `` Lightning Rod '' that really caught your attention as something different . The guys played it safe this time , trying to sound like the band they thought they should be . That kicked Adam Gardner totally off vocal duties , totally killed the bongo percussion , and turned the songwriting into a strict formatted process . This album has no variation , and suffers from it . Guster has always been a `` happy '' band , but this album is just a bit too sugar coated for its own good.Guster fans , I still would suggest looking into this album . It will not be your favorite album by the band , not by a longshot , but you will find 12 decent songs that will entertain you by a band that you like . To people who are not familiar with the band , DO NOT START HERE . Start with Lost and Gone Forever and Keep it Together.I hate writing a review like this . Guster is the band that got me into music , and they finally slipped . 4 year gap between albums and not one standout track ? It just does n't make sense . Guster seems to have always been trying to find their `` sound '' , and this is the album where they honed in on what they considered their best assets . Problem is , Guster 's definitive sound turns out to be when they have no idea what they want to sound like . This is not a great album . This is not a horrible album .

Something Guster has usually had no trouble doing ! I 've played the cd at least 10 times now trying my best to like it and I almost always forget it 's even playing . Guster puts their best foot forward on the first two tracks and then wanders aimlessly around the airwaves thereafter resulting in an album where very little makes you want to sing along or even tune in . One reviewer thought because they mention Jesus and allude to religious themes on a few songs Guster `` found Jesus . '' I think that only proves the point that it 's easy to tune this disc out . The `` religious '' tunes drip with sarcasm and disdain for religion if you can actually force yourself to pay attention to the lyrics . I suppose , on the good side , they do head back sonically in the direction of their earlier work .

'' It 's a shame because it starts off with the climbing-and-soaring `` I Did n't See It Coming . '' After that , it drifts off as quickly as it builds . It 's not to say the music is bad , it 's just really , really bland music coming from a band that had ( as I had assumed ) found its way.Could this be a beginning of a return to the old days ? ..before the departure of Isobel Campbell and the reinvention of their sound ? I certainly hope not . Stuart Murdoch seems to be a subtle visionary , a brilliant one , too , but `` Write About Love '' does n't support that at all .

Giving it a few listens was like real music coming back again compare what is going on in commercial music today . Along with a hand full of other artist who have ignored the current trends and just going back to making music the old fashion way with good lyrics , skillful musicians actually playing instruments , melodies that stay in your head long after the music stops playing and a vocalist who sang with a passion and had a certain uniqueness in the voice , Rockferry was like the great music of yester year done in a modern fashion . In some aspects , the songs from Rockferry felt like songs that were broadcast on the radio back in the 60s but somehow that got stuck in the upper atmosphere then suddenly release and now making their way to our radios . Best of all a new artist was emerging who was compared to other great singers of the past and to have a lot of class compare to the freak show that today 's pop tart put on these days.Now it is 2010 fall and you have released your follow up to Rockferry called Endlessly . I saw you perform the title song on the Jools Holland show and I was blown away . Well , Well , Well was a serviceable follow up to Mercy then I thought Ok , off to a good start . Then I started to read some of the early review of the CD and heard sample . That is when I went into oh no phase . You wanted to branch out , change producers and such but what has happened is that you did not take into consideration of why your fans liked Rocferry in proceeding with a follow-up . You lead the followers of Rockferry south then all suddenly we are being lead north . You 're taking in too many commercial considerations on your multiplatinum follow up . Duffy , the buyers of Rockferry liked the fact that that CD did not follow the current trends . I think a lot of your fans will be very disappointed with this follow-up as already seen by the three star reviews , not moving up the amazion.com sales chart and having a very bad billboard preview . Even worse is there are two Madonna retreads on this record , a rewrite of Poppa Do n't Preach in Keeping My Baby and Like A Virgin in Girl . Some reviewer have gave positive remarks to the song Too Hurt To Dance but this just sound like a rehash of a lot of slow heart break ballads of the late 1950s/60s.In conclusion , Rockferry was a record that I recommended to a lot of people and received positive feedback . In fact there was a lady I saw in a store checking out Rockferry CD , I walked over to her and let her listen to some samples I had on my IPOD . Needless to say she left the store with the CD . I would be embarrassed to recommend Endlessly to anyone . I might just end buying a few songs on line from the CD and just hope for the best next time . Duffy , please change course to where you were with Rockferry , while we did not want you to make a Rockferry II but to gradually move in new directions instead of a sudden shift to a place where your fans do n't want to go so quickly . The girls on the cover of Rockferry who appeared broken hearted at the train station were handing out music of substance . The pretty girl on the cover of Endlessly by way of cheesy arrangements and lackluster material is handing out cotton candy .

Listening to that record was like hearing the coolest songs coming out of the UK during that era , and it was one of the years ' best . Now , unfortunately , we have this mess . The up-tempo songs could be on any current pop diva 's record and seem cultivated for the living room dance floor of an audience too young or unsophisticated to appreciate the nuanced music that was such a marvelous showcase for Duffy 's voice . The ballads here are lifeless .

She had immediate success , but was lumped in as an Amy Winehouse clone . Her debut single `` Mercy '' was an immediate smash , but was quickly pegged as a one-hit wonder before she even released a second single from her debut album `` Rockferry '' . By the time she released the dreary but successful second single `` Warwick Avenue '' , she was written off as a fake by fellow musicians- the most scathing of remarks coming from fellow British singer Estelle . She went back into the studio in early 2010 to record a new album , and did a bit of cleaning house in the process . She got rid of her manager , sacked `` Rockferry '' producers Bernard Butler and Jimmy Hogarth and changed virtually all of the session musicians . She replaced the previous session musicians with the hip hop band The Roots and hired the legendary British singer-songwriter Albert Hammond to handle the production of her sophomore album `` Endlessly '' .After listening to her second release , it seems as if her desire to have more creative input was rather questionable . The album suffers from too much creative control- lyrically , the songs are borderline juvenile and the musical arrangements are bland and uninspired . Look no further than the lead off track `` My Boy '' , which sounds a little too close to Rod Stewart 's disco hit `` Do Ya Think I 'm Sexy '' - and that 's not a good thing . On the ballads `` Too Hurt To Dance '' , `` Do n't Forsake Me '' and the title track `` Endlessly '' her vocals are a little grating on the nerves the first time around . She sounds as if she may have knocked back a few shortly before she started recording . She sings a little out of key on the first single `` Well Well Well '' and gets upstaged by The Roots in the process . `` Lovestruck '' suffers from a terrible vocal performance , while `` Girl '' is overwrought with cringe-worthy songwriting .

Sigh.This album never comes close to rocking , and I must admit , I love when the Decemberists rock out . Every time the Queen showed up on `` Hazards of Love '' ? I got chills ; and I get giddy when I hear their King-Crimson slosh stomp on `` The Island '' .This album calmed me , soothed me , put me to sleep . For what it is- acoustic folk pop songs- it is good . That is not what I wanted from this band at this point , however , so I am disappointed . You may love it , I do n't know .

The Strokes seem to be searching for a sound and style -- unfortunately , nothing here really works . 'Games ' - sounds like early 1980 's electro-pop . Someone please tell The Strokes that the 1980 's ended over 20 years ago ... 'Machu Picchu ' - sounds like pop-Reggae ( not real reggae , more like 10-CC or other Brit-pop acts doing reggae tinged top-40 ) . Do n't expect this song to burn up any Billboard charts .

As a record , it is constantly morphing from old school Strokes , 80s synth ( 'two kinds of happiness ' and 'Games ' ) to first Impressions.Gratisfaction sounds like something out of a 'Spoon ' album with a Queen like transition between verses.Im not sure what to make of it . Its a bouncy track but the core melodies are so generic and boring . Maybe its because the melodies in general dont have the lyrical punch that the first two albums had . Do you remember Casablanca 's dynamic sarcasm and sincerity ... well now he either moans in the vain of the horrible `` ask me anything '' , muffles meaningless harmonies or incites cheesy sing along moments instead.You 're So Right could be mistaken for a radiohead song at first . `` tell me what happen -- Tell me what happen '' but then somewhere along the track it transcends into some sort of 'Pet Shop Boys ' showdown.Under Cover of Darkness is old school Strokes , reminds me of 'Someday ' with its melancholy .

You can tell Gaga tried to make power choruses and be radio friendly but it gets washed in with the heavy production which seems very lethargic and just TOO much to me.The album starts relatively strong with `` Marry The Night '' , the mega over played smash `` Born This Way '' , the intriguing and the very dark `` Government Hooker '' .Then comes `` Judas '' which I thought had potential to be a really amazing song but is ruined by the Dance-Dance-Revolutionish chorus . `` Americano '' is really over the top and ridiculous . `` Schei & szlig ; e '' is probably one of my favourite tracks . It again borders on mainstream accessibility and complete darkness which is interesting to listen to . `` You & I '' is hands down the best thing on this album .

They go on about 2 minutes too long and dont really give you a reason to stick around and listen to it.It doesnt pack the accessibility punch nor the dark avant garde punch.Its just below average background music and was very dissapointing after multiple listens.The only tracks in my mind worth RAVING about are Government Hooker , Schei & szlig ; e , You & I and The Edge of Glory.Luckily for Gaga , the public and her Little Monsters eat everything she does up even if the product is inferior and this will lead to huge sales . ( That and her hawking the album for 99c on Amazon and giving it away with every phone purchase at Best Buy..which is really not an admirable thing to do as an artist in my opinion ) I honestly cant see any of these singles taking off and being a # 1 worldwide smash like she did with `` The Fame '' and `` The Fame Monster '' and they probably wont.But I 'll give her credit where credits due and that is with the few songs I mentioned which are superior to a lot of songs on the radio right now ."}, "23110": {"id": "23109", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "By all accounts , `` The Fame '' was the perfect debut album for a superstar . It had all kinds of dance music , with crafty beats and tight production . When comparing Gaga 's debut against those of Rihanna , Katy Perry , Pink , Britney Spears , Ke $ ha , and all her contemporaries , Gaga 's album was by far the best of the bunch . There had not been a true debut album by a female pop star that was so excellent probably dating back to Cyndi Lauper 's `` She 's So Unusual '' in 1983 , which became the first female debut to ever spawn 5 singles in the top 10 . And not since 1988 ( Paula Abdul ) has a female pop star had multiple number one singles on both the Hot 100 and the dance charts.So , Gaga had much to live up to here , and there is no way possible to please everybody . The attempt to do so can be heard in the overproduction , which has WAY too much reverb , and some of the tracks run too long . But the biggest problem is the quality of the songs . This is a clear example of what happens when an artist is given too much musical freedom too soon , and the songwriters who wrote all of your earlier hits ( RedOne ) ca n't come up with songs quite as good the second time around . Witness the high-pitched screeches in `` Government Hooker '' in which , after repeating the phrase `` I am your hooker '' over and over , she yelps through autotune a long , extended `` hoooooookaaahhhhhh . '' And what happened to Gaga 's tendency to be Avant-Garde ? That has now been replaced with phrases like `` I 'm as free as my hair '' and `` It does n't matter if you love him , or capital H-I-M. '' As the album closes , there is a country ballad ( `` You and I ) which is a total clunker of a song , and a horrible electro-pop track called `` Electric Chapel '' which is more reverb and auto-tune , on a continuous loop.It will be interesting to watch sales for the album during it 's second week . `` Edge of Glory '' dropped from # 3 to # 19 on the Billboard chart in one week ; a week in which Gaga was on American Idol , The View , and SNL . Not since Michael Jackson 's `` HiStory '' has a musical album release been this hyped . But unlike Jacko , Gaga got weird too soon , and does not have classic albums like `` Thriller '' and `` Bad '' to fall back on .

She 's this loopy pop singer with weird hair and clothes , and most people either love her or hate her . Well , my personal opinion of Lady Gaga 's persona wo n't come into this -- it 's all about her new album , `` Born This Way . '' Well , brace yourself : It 's a bloated mess that rambles on far too long , with too many songs , too much noise , and no unifying style . `` Born This Way '' presents itself as a gay anthem , and it does this by thumping you over the head with obvious shout-outs like `` Do n't be a drag/just be a queen '' and `` No matter gay , straight or bi/Lesbian , transgendered life . '' But all Madonna comparisons aside , this song is a mess -- the producers heaped so many layers of sound that it sometimes sounds like Gaga is being smothered.Then there 's `` Judas , '' the second single of this album . This suffers from the same choking overproduction as `` Born This Way , '' with Gaga 's voice being smushed down under a thick fog of synthpop . Then again , she spends half the song squawking , `` Juda-JUDA-AW ! '' like an epileptic goose , so that might be a good thing.But what of the other songs ? Well , the album actually starts quite strong with the dark , glittering `` Marry the Night , '' and the bleakly desperate sex-with-presidents thumper `` Government Hooker . '' But things start going off the rails with the goopy romanticism of the Spanish-flavored `` Americano , '' the vaguely Germanic club melody `` Scheibe , '' and the cheesy `` Hair . `` After that , Gaga just ... seems to stop trying , and lets the following songs decay into a soggy mess of mediocre club pop . Some of the songs barely have melodies ( `` Black Jesus - Amen Fashion , '' `` Highway Unicorn ( Road to Love ) '' ) , and some are just so bland that it 's hard to remember them ( `` The Queen '' ) . I like `` Electric Chapel , '' but most of these songs could have been cut without anyone noticing.She does rouse herself enough to give distinctive sounds to the last couple songs ... but they 're AWFUL sounds : `` You And I '' sounds like a country singer wandered into a dance club and just started singing , and `` The Edge of Glory '' is a horrendously cheesy power ballad , complete with SAXOPHONES.In a nutshell , `` Born This Way '' is a huge bloated mess , bogged down with excess and collapsing under its own weight . It feels like Lady Gaga is trying to do EVERYTHING in this album . More sound ! More musical genres ! More random references to fashion , nightclubs , sex and gay people ! More dance songs that nobody can remember when they 're over ! As for Gaga 's lyrics , they have some interesting elements , like the strong undercurrent of Catholic/religious symbolism and the idea that `` bad kids '' are just fine because they were `` born that way . '' But her writing also tends to be insanely clumsy ( `` You 're black , white , beige , chola descent/You 're Lebanese , you 're Orient '' ) , and her symbolism is so obvious that it leaves bruises between your eyes.And her voice ? It 's the strongest part of any song where she tries , but too often it falls by the wayside in this album . In some songs , it 's swamped by all those electronic layers , and in some songs she just sort of croons without putting any effort into it.If they had trimmed off the B-sides and the extra production , `` Born This Way '' could have been a pretty decent pop album .

Sales of the album dropped off by 84 % from its sizzling ( but discount-inflated ) opening week . That 's the the steepest drop-off in sales , expressed in a percentage basis , of any of the 17 albums that sold 1 million units in a week in Nielsen SoundScan history.Gaga 's album sold 174,000 copies this week , down from 1,108,000 last week , when sales were goosed by a two-day , 99-cent sale at Amazon.The old record for the steepest drop-off following a million-unit week was held by *NSYNC 's 2001 album Celebrity . Sales dropped by 76 % in the week following its 1,880,000 debut . Two recent albums were tied for second place in the steepest drop-off column . Sales of Lil Wayne 's 2008 hit Tha Carter III and Taylor Swift 's 2010 smash Speak Now both dropped off by 69 % in the week following their debuts of 1,006,000 and 1,047,000 , respectively.A big drop-off was to be expected . But the fact that Gaga 's drop-off was steeper than any of the other follow-ups to albums that had a million-unit week is troublesome . It seems obvious that the opening week tally for Born This Way was generated not only by hard-core fans , but also by casual fans who just did n't want to pass up such a deal .

I had an opportunity to ask Mr. Weyland during the convention : `` After the infamous 'meat-suit ' disaster ( The Mark 9 LGG malfunctioned during a routine systems test - deafening 10 technicians , killing three and covering itself with their remains ) , we thought that it was a total wash . But we had some very brilliant people work on a new , more powerful sound generating platform , a better targeting system and a more radical bio-covering . We then re-packaged the Mark 10 , aiming at a younger , less sophisticated market and priced it to move . `` And `` move '' it did . Sales for the Mark 10 Ga-Ga have soared . Recent tests continue to be very promising . Ga-Ga 's Nagouchi MX34 sound generation system combined with the standard auto-tune hardware can cut through a three inch block of steel in less than 3 seconds ! Surprisingly , playback of the sound is almost as effective ; causing small animals to literally explode . Also , the bio-covering alone is enough to break the morale of an attacking force , truly frightening.Although some critics have called the Mark 10 LGG a `` cheap , tawdry , pointless and lacking any real value '' and `` the ugliest sounding thing around '' , sales continue to be very good for this item .

Most of the noise , both pro and con , concerning Lady Gaga currently exists in the form of hastily ejaculated , poorly punctuated ranting . I write this for people who are truly curious about this album 's sound , more specifically its place in the wider music world.Lady Gaga 's been enjoying immense success and popularity recently , building a reputation among the mostly uncritical press as a daring and original multimedia `` artiste . '' I thought Poker Face was a smart and sassy pop song , and am still impressed with the theatrical sound of Bad Romance , but I 've largely been underwhelmed with Lady Gaga 's output . Generally , her stuff falls into one of two categories : 1 ) `` not bad , but it does n't really stand out , '' or 2 ) `` this sounds WAY too much like ( past pop hit ) for my comfort ! '' She 's loads better than Katy Perry , and no worse than someone like Christina Aguilera , but I 've never understood where the fanatical obsession came from . Perhaps this is simply reflective of contemporary music culture , specifically of listeners who have abandoned earlier generations ' standards of greatness in performance , yet are still drawn like moths to the flame to worship anyone who happens to be in the spotlight , as if they were the next ( past legend ) . Whatever it may be , the fact remains that `` Born This Way '' is a largely homogeneous , forgettable affair . Many of the cuts likely sizzle in the clubs , but staying power is not the order of the day.The album 's strongest song is the opener , Marry the Night . The stomping beats and sleazy , buzzing synths make it a perfect club anthem . The problem is that , save for the modern production , it 's just a by-the-numbers Eurodance anthem from the early '90s . It 's practically begging to have a corny rap interlude ( eg : `` gon na marry the night , cuz it feels so right ; when I drive in my car , I look up at the stars , '' etc ) . It 's fun , but I 've largely heard it before ... From there , it 's more familiar territory . The title track is a shameless rip of Madonna 's Express Yourself ( Madonna herself called it `` reductive '' ) , Edge of Glory sounds a hundred other Cher-styled disco stompers , Government Hooker is a lesser version of Britney 's Gim me More , and Judas just `` sounds WAY too much like ( Bad Romance ) for my comfort . '' Most of the other songs are embarrassing exercises in style ( Americano , You & I ) , rehashes of other songs on the album ( Bloody Mary ) , or just nondescript dancefloor filler . Scheisse is kind of fun , but I doubt I 'll ever think to play it a few years from now.The production is well done , but over the course of the entire album , it feels very samey , with almost no contrast or breathing room available . The net result is a competent , effervescent pop experience that , while great for the dancefloor , is wearisome and not likely to endure the test of time.It 's obvious that Gaga has some talent , but this album shows no growth from her debut , only amplification .

The problem with this record , however , is that it is so busy , overblown , overhyped , and self-indulgent that it borderlines on parody . She 's not breaking new musical territory , she 's just producing a lot of 80 's techno noise and techno beats and trying to sprinkle in religion and `` controversial '' political/religious topics to `` shock '' the listeners , which is not only boring , but irrelevant and trite . It 's very difficult to tell one song from another , because they all sound the same , especially with the repetitive `` baby '' and `` Gaga-a-a-a-a '' crutch that she constantly has to use in her songs . Her lyrics are just laughable and incomprehensible . Her album is more of a production than it is a record . Even though the Fame/Fame Monster still had a lot of filler amongst the infectious hit tunes , at least there was more to like than what we 're seeing on Born This Way . The Fame/Fame Monster was fun , but it was also quirky , different , clever , and creative without trying so hard . Born This Way is a sad attempt at trying too hard with too much noise and hype . It 's disappointing , especially from an artist who is talented enough , and famous enough , that she does n't have to try so hard to be `` different '' and `` edgy . '' Sadly , with all the talent that Lady Gaga has , she focuses more on the image/gimmick than she does on the music . Not to mention , these days she tries way too hard to force a `` message '' in her songs ( ex : Hair , Bad Kids , Born This Way ) . It 's not sincere , it 's completely self-indulgent and corny . She 's focused on producing hit singles than she is at actually writing good music . The only track that was worth more than one listen is `` You and I '' ( which to me sounds a little too much like Speechless , but at least it showcases the style of music that Gaga SHOULD be doing , showcasing those vocals , the piano skills , and the human side of Gaga ) . I hope in the future Gaga could settle with a more laid back album that displays her true musical talents than this overblow , overhyped , outdated disco/80 's nonsense .

It 's not like we have n't heard this kind of stuff before either , but not with this much frequency . This would n't be much of an issue if it did n't take up more than half of the record 's 38 minute runtime and bury the aforementioned songs.As with all of Radiohead 's releases , I 've played the whole thing several times because I wanted to give the record a chance to reveal itself . It took me several listens to fully appreciate `` Amnesiac '' , which is the closest thing I can compare `` KOL '' to . While that record had the benefit of being a companion piece to `` Kid A '' , this record unfortunately comes off as an afterthought . If anything , `` KOL '' is basically Radiohead at the crossroads , and it was probably never meant to be taken for more than what it is -- a record to simply bridge the gap . There 's no telling where they 'll go after this , but the next proper LP ( or EP ? ) will most likely be an improvement ."}, "23143": {"id": "23142", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "If Thom Yorke stuck his head in an oh so deep mud puddle and blew real hard into the murky depths would the resultant recorded sound be considered brilliant music by the Radiohead faithful ? I suspect so . And that my dears is the problem with Radiohead in 2011 and the new album The King of Limbs . Clocking in at under 38 minutes and with a scant 8 tracks this would have been a nice book-end companion to Yorke 's failed solo album The Eraser . At this stage in their career Radiohead can put out just about anything and it will be gobbled up by the faithful like mother 's milk . So , I 'll confess , I 'm an OK Computer Radiohead guy . I love that album . Give me some more guitar fellas , and leave out all the incessant crackling , blipping , and noodling . Much ado about nothing , I say . But let 's get down to a track by track assessment to be fair . Bloom starts things off not badly , except for the annoying crackling and popping nonsense built into the percussive effects . A bit of almost classical piano , horns and a trancey feel to this tune . It 's OK . Morning Mr. Magpie is more interesting , funky and the guitars chime . I think the way Yorke sings in a cooing way is rather fetching . I quite enjoy the lines `` You Stole it , give it back '' -- or something like that . Further along `` You know you should , but you do n't '' is sung in an out there way that is appealing on a number of levels . The birds chirping at the end -- if those are real birds -- beats computerized bleeps and beeps any day . The next track Little by Little also has guitar , which is encouraging . I like the trippy vibe on this one . Feral is , well , feral . Actually this `` song '' is really brutal and epitomizes what 's wrong with Radiohead these days . Repetitive nonsense and noise . Press skip and move on . Lotus Flower , which I guess is the single , shows the album moving in a better direction . The reverb-drenched chorus is cool . But this track does meander a bit musically and lyrically . Codex is suberb ! The piano is lovely , as are the strings . The song is a slow burner . Yorke intones fairly sweetly on Codex : `` Glide on ... jump off the edge into a cool lake . '' Indeed ; more please ! At this point the album has me hooked-in again , briefly . Give Up the Ghost is a wondrous thing . There 's acoustic guitar on this song . Like Codex this one just seems to evolve as it goes . The layering of the vocals is particularly effective on this tune and it has an almost , dare I say it , pastoral feel . Separator , the album closer , is a return to the same rather ordinary beats . Not bad , I guess . So 9 albums in Radiohead seems to have found itself in a deep rut and it 's one that they may never get out of . You know I ca n't understand why a band like Radiohead -- with such a thin catalogue of really good music -- can still sell millions of albums while a truly great band like Australia 's The Church languishes in relative obscurity . Folks , if you are reading this review and you like guitar-based alternative rock check out The Church 's brilliant 23 studio albums . Now , there 's a band with legs and enduring greatness ."}, "23144": {"id": "23143", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I 've been a Radiohead fan since the `` Amnesiac '' era , ever since I was given a disc with a medley of songs from OK Computer , Kid A , and the `` new one '' , Amnesiac . I wore that CD-R out and I went out and bought OK Computer - I instantly fell in love . I soon bought every Radiohead CD available.They have been experimenting and expanding their catalog of sounds and structures ever since then , and I have respected them for that.When In Rainbows came out , I was floored .

I was not impressed and I was actually , if I dare say it , bored with the record . Call me narrowminded , call me tasteless , call me un-artful . I did n't like it . There was nothing catchy enough to keep my attention , and nothing for my ears or emotions to hold on to . I do n't mind the beats and the blurps - but please , they have to be catchy.To me , this record sounded like static , a ghostly megaphone , and a snare loop stuck on repeat.Every song sounds like a variant of `` The Gloaming '' from Hail To The Theif ( with the exception of `` Codex '' and `` Give Up The Ghost '' ) .

These are excellent strings , the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar . They are inexpensive and sound great . For somebody that is a casual home musician , coated strings might be a better choice . The difference , somebody that plays a two or three hours every day , will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in . Somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem.The big question for me , is the Balanced Tension worth a little extra money ? It seems like yes they are . The strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better . There is n't a huge difference . The direct comparison string is D'Addario EXL110 , ( D'Addario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings , Regular Light , 10-46 ) , at roughly $ 3.50 a set , these are good solid strings at a bargain price . The EXL110BT strings are about $ 5.00 a set . If I were going through a set of strings every few days , the EXL110 's would probably be a better idea . But if a set is going to last a week or two , the savings overall is pretty small , I would use the EXL110BT's.My personal preference is coated strings , I like Elixir strings a lot . The new D'Addario coated strings are fine , but they end up being about the same price as Elixir . I 'll stick with what I know well.My 1981 Lucille did love these strings . They worked out just fine.On the packaging , I do n't like what D'Addario has done . All the strings are in a single plastic package , I prefer individual paper envelopes . They loop two strings together and I hate that . When I 'm stringing my guitar I like to work with one string at a time , and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench . Sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while . They are trying to save packaging , and that is a good thing . But seriously , that little paper would n't kill anybody . I also do n't care for the color coded rings on the strings . Lucille has an open bridge where I can see those electric colors . It is a small thing , but I do n't like it . I prefer that the rings all be brass , one color . Yeah , I 'm the only one that sees that problem . If I work one string at a time from an individual envelope , the color coding is not necessary.These are fine strings .

One of the little fingers that holds the `` ball '' in the `` socket '' on the back of the tuner broke off , so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces . This model works only by vibration unlike the red one , so without the clip , it is not very useful ( it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it , but it is n't very convenient ) . I would just super-glue it together at a good angle , but I have to put it in different positions on different instruments .

Put a crimp or bend in each string about 3/4 of an inch or so from the ball at the end , about 45 degrees from the straight portion of the string , fairly sharp . Just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on . Then push the ball into the hole and make sure the crimped portion of the string is slid up against the wall of the hole closest to the neck of the guitar , out of the way of the pin . Then slide in the pin and make sure the ball is not resting on the bottom of the pin ! The pin should fit tightly into the hole , and the crimp you made in the string keeps the ball on the side of the pin , not below it . Each pin has a groove in it where the string passes into the hole on the side of the pin . After pushing in the pin , you can pull on the string in the direction of the nut , and the ball should be pressing the pin sideways in the hole , keeping it tight . It may be under or on the side of the bridge inside the guitar , but I ca n't see in there to verify this is so , but I know that the ball is pressing sideways on the pin !

For one , the guitar does n't have a `` finish , '' not even a glossy clearcoat -- it 's solidbody wood , sanded smooth and given a deep wood stain . Secondly , the guitar is pictured as being much lighter in color than it actually is .

I have a bit of buzzing on one fret , but that can easily be fixed with a good sanding and polish . The guitar can also be strung and tuned easily , though with any guitar of this body style you 'll have to continually tune-and-retune until the strings will keep a tuning .

Got good gear ? This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny . I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that 's bigger than this amp ! Still , it packs a punch . With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half , I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue . Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go . Yes , this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have . If you want to quietly play along with some tunes , you can . Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube . Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7 . I understand that 's standard . A JJ is nice , but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone . Dig out an old Phillips , RCA , Sylvania , or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother . I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror : warmed it right up ; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still , compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ , this guy does sound more solid state than anything . BUT , compared to a buddy 's Roland and solid state Ampeg , it 's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects ( reverb , echo , chorus ) can get noisy . So , if you like pedals , stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters : a previous reviewer is right . The external power brick for this guy seems fragile . I 'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp . It 's holding up , but one round with my cat and I 'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance # 1 : One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes . I found that out quickly . So , get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp . I 'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance # 2 : This is a 20 watt amp , right ? WELL ... if you do n't run a 4ohm speaker , you wo n't get all 20 watts . The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output . ( Yes yes ... do n't quote physics to me . ) At 8ohms , I still get good volume . But at 16ohms ( like my BH110 ) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp . That said , I 'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab . The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ , while nice , ca n't put out the low notes like I 'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean . But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears ; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance # 3 : The Micro Terror is so small and so light , it 'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord . Unlike a nice 20 pound amp , the chord wo n't pull out . So : BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance # 3 : The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors ... though , it will gouge your floor.And then there 's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier : if the power is noisy or ungrounded , you will wind up with hiss no matter what . I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it ; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise . ( If you do n't have one , get one . The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work . ) The SummaryAfter all that , I can still say : I love this little amp ! I 've gigged with it and it sings well . Plus , the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh ... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price , you can likely afford to pick up $ 40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig .

I 've owned or borrowed models from Fostex and Korg going back several decades but Tascam always seems to be out in front when it comes to ease of use and value . Even as the market evolved from cassette to digital , Tascam recorders have kept the same feel and ease of use . I had a Boss Micro BR-80 for a while , but I found the all-menu interface annoying and difficult to use . I kept forgetting the sequences to set up rhythm tracks , record , and mix down , and ended up having to repeat things over and over . I soon sold it , and then replaced it with a Tascam DP-004 when that appeared on the market . The Tascam was n't really any more powerful than the Boss , and lacked the built in rhythm tracks , but it had fewer menus and more actual switches and knobs that made it more intuitive in use , and more like an actual mixing board or traditional cassette-based recorder.After the DP-004 Tascam produced a follow-on six track unit and this recorder , the 8-track DP-008 . When it was first introduced a couple of years ago it really was a revolutionary unit . There were plenty of 8-track recorders out there , but none that were that small and that inexpensive . It 's also more than just a DP-008 with more tracks . The DP-008 has a much improved mastering ability that allows you to adjust EQ , compression , and effects individually on tracks for the mix down , while leaving the original tracks unaffected . Like the DP-004 , it has built in microphones and can also be used for direct stereo recording . Unlike the DP-004 , it comes with an external power supply in the box ( a $ 24 option with the original 004 ) and can use an external battery pack.I 've been playing with my 008 all weekend , doing a mixture of stereo and multitrack recordings . One thing I noticed right off was that there 's a significant amount of noise in the monitor mix while multitracking . I was afraid this would translate into noisy recordings , but the noise is n't there in the finished playback . I also noticed that while the basic recording functions are more or less unchanged from those on the 004 , the new mixdown functions are much more complex and required constant reference to the manual . As mentioned previously , there 's an awful lot of capability there and it 's going to take some time to be able to use it effectively . Most of that functionality is menu-based , rather than being accessibly directly from the front panel , and I have to say that 's one thing I do n't really care for . The only input device you have to select functions and parameters and menus is a scroll wheel that 's not nearly as comfortable as a knob or a mouse or touchpad.Most of my recording lately has been done with various Apple platforms . At home , I use Garage Band on my iMac and a USB-equipped Alesis console for input . Away from home I use Garage Band on my iPad and ( for ultimate portability ) iPod Touch . All of these platforms are much more intuitive to use than the DP-008 and much more powerful . Of course , they 're also a lot more expensive , and lack the built-in stereo microphones and ability to plug instruments and microphones directly in without some sort of additional interface . Having XLR connectors as well as 1/4 '' inputs is a really nice touch , something you never saw on portables from a few years ago . I like the old-school approach of the DP-008 as well as the all-in-one package approach.If I was just starting out in home multitrack recording and did n't have a lot to spend , I think the DP-008 might be a good choice . It 's really good enough to produce music for a band 's first CD releases , and costs less than a decent microphone . WIth 8 full tracks there 's no need to do track bouncing to get four instruments and four voices down , and if you really need to , you can bounce and add a further six tracks , giving you 14 in all . I do n't think it 's going to replace my iPod for pocket portability or my iPad for functionality ( Garage Band gives me a full orchestra , keyboards and drums as well ) but having the microphones and instrument preamps built in does make it much easier to set up and use for live recording . It should get a lot of use at my home and elsewhere in the coming year ."}, "23292": {"id": "23291", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "THis system works great !

Some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the `` Cheapies '' I 've been dealing with Musician 's friend forever . Rogue is Musician 's Friend 's brand . Music 123 is a Musician 's Friend affiliate and they also sell Rogue guitars . I have several different models of Rogue guitars and I 'm impressed with all of them . The Rogue RA-090 is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the Fender Starcaster . Here 's the good part , the Rogue is about half the price of the Fender ! Many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one . Once they realize it 's not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers , they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten . If you 're not sure if you 're serious about learning to play , this is the guitar for you . Even if you 're an intermediate to advanced player , you still ca n't go wrong with this guitar . It has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument . The finish and workmanship is also like what you 'd find on a more expensive guitar . They look , play and sound great ! Many people tend to shy away from Rogue guitars because of the low price . They figure a guitar that cheap ca n't be much good . That 's where they 're wrong ! You have to actually play one to understand what I 'm talking about . Once you play a Rogue guitar , you too , will become a believer . This is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire . If it happens to get damaged or stolen you 're not out an arm and a leg . I love Fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites , but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar , the Rogue is a much better value than the Fender and equal if not better in quality . The Rogue RA-090 comes in a variety of color choices . If or when you decide to sell it , you can usually get back what you paid for it.I give Rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one . I 've been playing guitar for 51 years so I should know what I 'm talking about . I do not own stock in Musician 's Friend , Music 123 , or Rogue guitars and I do n't get paid to endorse them .

It 's less than ten bucks.It has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar . As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole . It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole , as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.It is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices . Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4 '' to 1/4 '' coupler ( to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord ) . You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.It is a passive pickup , so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device . If you do n't have a preamp system , this will do you no good.So because of the limitations I rate it as above . For what it does though -- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments , it does okay . I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money , including adhesive-disk mikes . I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from .

Sometimes the attachment that you fix at the back of the speedor helps in giving some stability to it . But not always . I feel there 's a major design flaw in the speedor . Apart from giving one big wheel in the front , LEGO should have provided two small ones at the back . Then the speedor would have moved very nicely . Currently , the ONLY reason that people buy speedor is because of the minifig . And THAT is the only reason I bought this set . In fact I have TWO of this set . That 's because I LOVE the Gorzan minifig . And I will still buy more of this set in the future . I am building a small gorilla-army ! & # 61514 ; Kids are gon na like this set because of the minifig and hey kids will mostly like the speedor ( Kids will enjoy any toy even if it has faults..they are kids after all ! ! ) .

On one end is a blade , while the other head has a dragon head . The grip for your child is in roughly the middle of the sword , and it has two buttons , one at each end of the grip . One button causes the sword to light up a bit and make sounds ( including playing the Megaforce Power Ranger theme song ) , while the other button you squeeze down to make the dragon head at the bottom of the sword spin . There is also a place on the outside of the grip where you can insert Power Cards , just like in the TV show . The sword is made of a hard plastic , except for the tip of the sword and parts of the dragon 's head , which are soft , pliable plastic ( which helps prevent injuries during play ) .My boy was extremely excited when I gave him the sword , and loves to play with it . The sword itself is modeled off of the ultra dragon sword from one of the episodes in the series , and he now loves to watch that one over and over while he plays with the sword . We 've had the sword for a few weeks now , and he has n't gotten tired of it . I suspect the length of time your child plays with this sword is dependent on how much he 's `` into '' Power Rangers , but I suspect my little guy will be playing with this sword for weeks to come.Overall , this is a good choice for a young power ranger fan . It has a few bells and whistles that help make it fun to play with .

If she ever got a doll- she wanted Frankie . And I see why . Frankie is adorable . I believe is supposed to be a female & # 34 ; Frankenstein & # 34 ; ( hence the name Frankie ? ) .She has very big black eye lashes and a little scar stitched on the side of her cheek .

She comes with a blue portfolio ( does n't open ) , a blue/black/yellow plastic purse ( does n't open ) , and a black brush with the 'Monster High Skull ' design on the back.She is made of plastic . It 's not a vinyl 'Barbie-like ' material . It 's actually hard plastic . Her head moves up and down and side to side . Her wrists , elbows , and arms move in all directions . Her knees and thighs also move in all directions . Her hair is tied back in a pony tail with a rubber band . She also has bangs . Once the hair is taken out of the pony tail it 's very full and easy for young girls to comb . It does n't tear out when brushed . There are no bald spots- like some dolls have when the pony tail is removed.The attention to detail and quality in this doll is amazing . It 's very well made . Even if the arm does pop off ( which occasionally happened with rough play by her brother in our house ) the child can snap it back on by themselves . Both of her siblings love this doll as well . It 's not just 'girly'- her brother will pick it up sometimes too.The doll comes with a small school 'yearbook ' that lists all of the monster high characters as well as a bit about them . It 's made of magazine-quality paper . It 's glossy . It also comes with a page of stickers of all of the monster high characters . The stickers stick very well .

My kiddos are a different race than me and Monster High really preaches that it does n't matter what culture or background you come from- deep down everyone is the same . I find that to be a beautiful message and love that Monster High is race-friendly . It 's not really targeted towards one skin color of young girls ( like Barbie 's and other dolls tend to be ) .The plastic of this doll is thick and durable . It 's very easy to clean ! And it has n't broken yet ( which with my kids is a feat that deserves an applause ) . She 's very well loved and very well-played with . My kids ages 7 to 10 all love her and I 'm so happy I bought her . She was the perfect gift and has held up with outstanding quality .

Her face kind of reminds me of dawn of the dance Frankie . The stitches on her cheek are kind of blurry on the doll I got , not crisp and sharp like they usually are . It does n't look terrible , just not as nice as it could be . Her bolts are very shiny metallic silver .

The dress has two ruffles at the hem , one being the same material as the rest of the dress and one being a black , grey , and turquoise diamond print . There is a yellow lightning bolt running down the front of the dress and an adorable yellow satin collar at the neckline . She wears a turquoise pleather 3/4 sleeve jacket over the dress .

She also comes with a turquoise `` folder '' that actually opens and closes as well . It is embossed with a skullette and some stitches on the front and a diamond pattern with little lightening bolts and hearts . She comes with her `` fearbook '' which has a sheet of 16 stickers showing various monster high students in their fearbook picture pose . It also shows the faculty and has tells you who Frankie voted for cutest couple , ghoul spirit , etc . and has one page with all of the students autographs .

She was pulled from the cases , assuming to fix this issue.When I saw her being sold by a third party vendor here for retail , with Amazon Prime shipping , I thought I 'd see if the issue had been dealt with . Received her today and , nope , it 's the same mistake doll I already have . I do n't fault the seller for this , they can only put up the photo released by Mattel.I 'm posting this review as a heads up for anyone who may be ordering this doll online - you 're not gon na get Operetta as pictured . I have n't come across any fan who 's bought the correct version of this particular doll . No clue as to when Mattel will re-release Operetta with the correct mask , either.As for the doll outside of that , a few previous reviews have been wonderful with their descriptions of everything else BUT the mask issue.EDIT 8/9/2013 - Contacted Amazon and a nice guy named Andy assured me if you order FROM THEM you should get the doll pictured , not the goof . If you do get the goof , they 'll replace it .

Her hair is mostly scarlet red with a black stripe starting at each temple and one black stipe at the front of her hairline curling into the victory roll . Her makeup is simple but pretty . She has very dark pink eyeshadow lining both her upper and lower lids with medium purple in her crease and shimmering white at her browbone . Her lips are a very deep garnet .

In her right ear she wears a black earring composed of four records of varying size . She wears a strapless sweetheart neckline dress that is red with a print of black musical notes . There is a light red or pink ( it is hard to tell ) tulle ruffle with black glitter dots at her hips and the bottom of the skirt is lined with a dark purple tulle ruffle . Over her dress around her waist she wears an adorable black underbust corset/waist cincher with white painted on lacing . This is a separate piece from the dress .

She wears white and black spectator/spats style booties . The are mostly white with black toe caps and a black curled heel with a spider web design .

Her hair this time is long , down to her waist , and predominantly yellowish blonde with blue streaks .

On her right wrist is a gold bracelet made of little connected balls , and her left wrist has a thin pink bracelet . Her dress is done in an A-line shape . The material has a teal backround with a print of pink orange and chartreuse coral and black fishbones and seahorses . The bodice of the dress is done with a shiny iridescent coral colored material . It has a little bow on the front that is shaped to look kind of like seashells ( like the bra Ariel wore in the little mermaid ) . There is a thin iridescent ribbon tied around her neck and a lime green tulle ruffle at the hem of the dress . She wears a black fishnet short sleeve shrug over the dress . Under the dress , she wears some super cute capri leggings . The are bright pink with shiny silver dots all over them that make them shine and sparkle . Her metallic gold `` rope '' belt is adorable , and probably my favorite accessory of this particular doll .

Her wedge slides are translucent teal blue and made of different size `` bubbles '' all stuck together . The wedge heel has some adorable little cutouts as well . She comes with a seafoam green folder/portfolio that actually opens up . It has a fishscale motif molded in the front as well as a little seahorse at the closure .

We think Fisher-Price is counting on that ... they were introduced as a 2 pack in 2010 , and you can still find them as such with an $ 11 MSRP . But F-P has now `` tweaked '' them a little bit - giving them different facial expressions , darker roofs and wheels , and are `` re-introducing '' them in 2013 -- - SEPARATELY , so that you have to buy both ( F-P 's MSRP for their small trains/vehicles remains $ 6 , so we guess they want that extra buck ! ) Annie & Clarabel are the passenger coaches which were given to Thomas when he started working on his own branch line . They respect all of the engines , but particularly Thomas and Gordon ; they 're also quick to scold Thomas when he gets ornery - but he loves them dearly ! Annie always travels facing & coupled to Thomas , with Clarabel coupled to Annie and facing backward ... she prefers to watch the scenery ! F-P KNOWS you 'll want both , so they 've changed their packaging strategy . Our advice is to buy one of the 2-packs while they 're still available.If you 're interested in starting a rolling stock collection of your own , there are 21 items in the TnP line as of summer 2013 , and they are ( in order of introduction ) : Quarry Car , Annie & Clarabel ( 2 pack ) , Sodor Supply Co. , Rocky , Troublesome Truck , Diesel Fuel Tanker , Storybook Car , Sodor Zoo Snake Car , Bubble Tanker , Farm Animal Car , Sodor Mining Co. , Spider Exhibit Car , Sodor Cement Mixer , Sir Topham Hatt 's Musical Caboose , Crocodile Special , Talking Troublesome Trucks ( 2 pack ) , Sodor Circus Monkey , Oil Tanker , Hector , and separate re-introductions of Annie and Clarabel.We did want to add this `` tweaked '' version of Annie to the Take-n-Play collection we started in 2010 for our older grandson as soon as we saw her on Amazon for $ 5.99 with free shipping ( right at Fisher-Price 's $ 6 MSRP ) so that it 's a complete 4 years , but this is one more issue we 've added to our list of reasons to make this the last year for the collection , instead of continuing it for our younger grandchild . Now they 're using a `` re-introduction '' ploy - at no design cost to them - to squeeze another buck out of their customers . F-P has - in our opinion - really gone downhill on the product quality of the TnP line , particularly over the past year . They use a much lighter weight die-cast metal now for the trains & vehicles , have added a lot more plastic instead of metal when it comes to the rail cars , eliminated the `` chugging '' sounds from the talking engines , and are raising MSRPs on some items at the same time they 're reducing quality . We 've had so much fun interacting with our older grandson with this line , so we were really disheartened to see all of the quality shortcuts . At least our younger grandchild will be able to enjoy the collection of the first few years of the line , when it was definitely high quality with great attention to detail !

Once we were confident she was fine with that fact , we ordered it for her.The ramps works perfectly . My only concern is the chair elevator that suspends from the top of the green pole you see in the picture . It is made so that when a figure rolls onto it , it slides down and then the figure continues on the bottom ramp . So far , it works great , but the chair seems to barely lock into place at the top of the pole , which I realize is necessary for it to function , but it seems to barely stay in place . I 'm not sure how long it will continue working properly.The sounds are loud - be warned - but the music is enjoyable and the sayings are varied . There 's a lunch tray that flips to reveal different types of food , and the sounds react accordingly.The dance floor is powered by pushing a lever down repeatedly , and it basically lifts the floor up and down , making the figurines bounce a bit . I do n't mind this feature because it 's good for the child to have some kinetic engagement.All in all , I was very pleased with this toy and would recommend it .

All big hits with the kid.If you buy the school and matching bus , that is supposed to go with it , they BOTH include Gil and Mr.Grouper ... .which seems silly since they encourage you to buy them together then give you the same characters ? ? Also , the slide deal just is not working like on the commercials ... ..not surprised . Our guppies never make it to the 2nd slide on their feet ( or wheel , I should say ) . The drop from 1st to 2nd slide always tips them over . And if you try to lower the 2nd slide to let them all roll into the matching bus as they show you , the flimsy slide gets crooked and the guppies barely make it into the bus w/o help .

She does n't want to clean up her mess ! Ugh ! I have to do it ( which you really , really need to maintain it or you can ruin the doll ) . She gets a kick out of the baby 's accidents.She 's been having a blast and the doll is super cute !"}, "23704": {"id": "23703", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "First things first : The `` real surprises '' in the name refer to the doll 's ability to simulate eating and then pooping .

It helps that the doll looks just like her.The doll is a little bigger than I thought she would be , but that 's a good thing . Also , as mentioned in other reviews , she 's kind of loud . But she has a good repertoire of sayings and such and everyone who has seen it thinks the doll is `` very cute . `` The refill pack for diapers and food is available here at Amazon . It contains 10 diapers , 10 food packs and 10 juices . It currently runs around $ 20 , which seems like a lot to me . If you 're a parent who wants to avoid having to buy the pack , know that the doll is great without using the feed/poop features -- but given the doll talks about feeding and such , your little one might insist on experiencing the doll 's gastrointestinal wonders . And that might get expensive fast . Also , you 'll be the one cleaning the toy after feedings , so that 's another thing to consider.All in all , if your child wants a cute doll with good animatronics and realistic feeding behaviors , this is a great choice .

My husband put the castle together last night as I decorated and wrapped , and I instantly fell in love . It 's quite a bit sturdier than other castles we 've owned , Sofia says many cute phrases , and the extra accessories are nice additions.Upon waking up , the castle had a mind of it 's own . While the Sofia and Amber dolls both activate their own voices , James & The King activate Sofia 's , and the mom & Clover activate nothing at all . The Sofia 's doll head very easily pops off , but so far has only happened once when I was taking it out of the package ( for the animal friends , but all of the Sofia 's are built the same ) . Of course , the voices work only when they want to which is about 25 % of the time . There is a button to press on the voice box that tells it to wake up and talk -- -most of the time , I have to physically pull the voice box out of the castle , turn the switch from on to off back to on , and snap it back in for it to respond.Overall , it 's a very cute castle , it 's well made and seems sturdy . The accessories are cute , but the voice box is a hot mess ! I 'm still on the fence about keeping it . For $ 54.98 ( or $ 60 depends on where you shop ) it should work !

For what we paid it should have all the figurines in my opinion , and it feels flimsy . Honestly if we had n't trashed the box opening it I would send this toy back .

I wanted to post to all those disappointed with the first castle release that there are replacement parts for the castle now . Mattel will send you a Sofia ( whose head stays in tack ) , a staircase ( that does n't fall off easy ) , a talking box ( Roland and Miranda play royal entrance music , Amber talks , Clover still touchy , others say Sofia voiced phrases but that have to do more with their character ) , and some small parts that may get lost that come with castle . They will also send you a Sofia and Amber doll from Royal family collection . Overall , I 'm happier with the product now . And my daughter is thrilled that not everyone speaks in Sofia 's voice and that the heads stay on . To new purchasers - I 'm not sure what version Amazon is selling . Best to check the stores and get the newest release ( the new one has a plastic 2nd floor ) .orig post.This is a product that I really wish would have been on the AMAZON VINE program and had some reviews before the `` preorder '' was available . My daughter ( 3 years old ) has been so excited for this toy to arrive at our home since I showed it to her when I first preordered it ( her birthday was in May and it was to be a birthday gift , why I showed it to her ) . She plays daily with her Fisher Price Loving Family Dollhouse ( everyday since Christmas ) , and I knew a Sofia castle would be amazing to her and a toy that would get alot of use.My honest advice . If your child does not know about this toy and you are merely trying to use this as a gift , do n't bother . Your life will be much happier without this toy . Buy a Loving Family Dollhouse..I give that toy 5 stars . If your child knows about this toy and is asking for it , purchase at your own risk , you have been warned.Pros : - I think it 's decently sturdy and easy to put together ( minus the paper flooring on the second floor ) - It 's cuteCons : ( pretty much what everyone else has hit on ) - Sofia 's head popped off 3 times today ( `` Mommy , uh oh ... .her head came off ... waaahhhhhhh '' ) - Clover does n't actually fit in securely in the little `` hide go seek '' window seat ... he falls in to the hole ( `` mommy ... .waaahhh '' ) - Out of about 20 tries , Clover 's voice worked exactly once.- I fear for the destruction of the paper floor on the second floor.I would totally return it if she did n't desire to play with it , but she played through the frustration all day . I also fear for the arrival of the Royal Family to our home in a few days . I understand that the characters do n't speak correctly either , that King Roland and Prince James do n't stand at all , and that they heads pop off the characters as well.Mattel - Please test your products before producing . Seriously . I knew this toy was in production since before Christmas , you have had plenty of time to show it to a small panel of kids and watch them play with it . This is the third toy we have purchased/received in a month with horrible construction from Mattel ( specifically this toy , the barbie dream pool , and the Disney Princess MagicClip Aurora Carriage ) .Disney - Make your own toys .

In the picture - all of these details really shine . But when you get it out of the box there are many glaring problems:1 . The floors are made of almost paper thin cardboard . Not only do the dolls have a hard time staying upright but there 's no way that this will last 5 minutes with the 3-6yr old crowd . I was pretty shocked to see cardboard at this price point.2 . The plastic is used to construct this castle is flimsy -- think happy meal toy.3 . Because the plastic is flimsy , when you put the toy together you are constantly worried you will break it because it goes together by pushing the plastic into the corresponding slots.4 . Some pieces are TINY . There are tiny plates and goblets that fit inside the length of a dime . They warn customers about this on the box but I might think twice about giving them to a 3 year old.5 . The dolls head swivels and is held together with a ball and socket that is fragile . Like the cardboard issue , I ca n't imagine that the head with stay on for long -- especially with younger kids.6 . The doors and windows pop out easily and the staircase wobbles and is awkward.Overall , once together , this castle is FRAGILE . If your child dropped it , the plastic might break , and at the very least the turrets and windows would pop off . We also have a little people castle from Fisher Price that take ALOT of abuse that is nowhere near as pretty but is much more durable , sturdy and more expensive looking with no cardboard . If you have a young child , but that one and get the Disney Store made Sofia play figurines for them to use with the FP castle.Those with older kids , you may have a fighting chance but you will be majorly disappointed by what you get for your money.I do n't recommend this product at all and it 's a shame because its such a great franchise ."}, "23712": {"id": "23711", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Just as other reviewers stated , these dolls do not stand up and the heads often come off .

There are simply external boundaries for the inner track that force the car to run in a figure 8 underneath the track . That part works fine , the car just pushes against the plastic guide on the outside and that forces it to go where it should , there 's no `` track '' on the bottom . But the top track , the one that has the `` Winner 's Circle '' and everything , is a complete disaster . Even with me cranking it as fast as it will go , the car *sometimes* can complete a single lap up there . More often than not , the `` trick '' parts of the track screw things up and the car stops there ... The winners circle part has a spring inside that snaps it into place onto the track when you decide the race is over and press on the Piston Cup up there . Until that point it 's rotated so as to not interfere with the race . Press the Piston Cup , the spring rotates it into place so it can capture the car . There 's a small clear plastic piece that then pops up so the car finishes out the remainder of it 's energy spinning around in it . That part works fine , but the odds on the car having any energy left to make it that far even on the first lap are poor ... If you have correctly sized cars that can sit in the `` observation area '' , when the car spins in the winners circle , that makes little pieces of the track under the spectators move , so that it looks like they 're moving up and down cheering . My son would 've been more impressed had they simply had a plastic piece with a sticker of people that moved up and down since at least that would work more consistently.All in all , a fail on the upper track , even if the lower track works alright . Definitely not worth the purchase . The lower track is the only reason it even gets two stars . If it were just the top track that was part of the race here , I would 've given one star ."}, "23740": {"id": "23739", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I remember playing with Matchbox cars and generic plastic tracks back in the 80s ( everything was universal back in those days ) and felt somewhat nostalgic when I had the opportunity to review the latest entry from the Disney Merchandising Empire , namely the Cars Speedway . Course I , a 6'5 29 year old male with graying hair , would have looked REALLY silly to my roommates trying to test this product by myself so I , as I had done with previous reviews on toys , enlisted the help of my neighbors , who have two children between the ages of 7-10 ( I did n't ask , silly me ) to test it out while I took notes nearby . It did n't take long for problems to occur starting with assembly.The instructions were ... well ... crappy and exceedingly vague for anyone that does n't assemble anything on a daily basis . The mother , who is about as normal as blueberry pie ( hehe , South Pacific reference ! ) , called me over within five minutes expressing frustration at what the instructions meant . The pictures were somewhat confusing even to me , and I used to install home theaters and home appliances at Best Buy . I had to violate my own prime directive of reviewing non-interference to assist the mother in construction and I quickly quipped that I certainly hope the writers of the manuals do not moonlight as 911 Operators ( `` Perform CPR by using your hands ! `` ) Even with my help , it took approximately 30 minutes to assembly what should 've have been a 10-minute job and we came to an even worse realization after that.Now , I 'm not a parent but I 've moved around enough and spent enough time at other friend 's houses as a child to know that most children 's rooms are carpeted . It 's a safety and comfort issue . Now , where does this fit into my review ? Well , the product is basically a two-level track that starts on the bottom floor , that sits on the ground , and the cars are shot by a launcher up a ramp to the upper level or around a loop on the ground level . Problem is that the ground floor is little more than a plastic perimeter/guardrail that guides the cars and NOT an actual track . Also , there 's a few inches of space between the launcher and the ramp to the upper level , meaning the car has to traverse across whatever surface it 's sitting on ( hardwood , carpet , your Dad 's back , etc . ) before using the remaining momentum to ascend.In short , this thing does NOT work on carpet , ergo use in the vast majority of children 's rooms.Now , I was always under the impression that Disney had one of the best marketing divisions in the world , and yet , they overlooked THIS little problem that even I , a non-parent , figured out almost immediately ( Hey , Disney Toy Execs ! Did I mention that I am available to hire as a full-time bonafide toy tester ? *waggles eyebrows sarcastically* ) .The mother and I quickly relocated the speedway , which almost fell apart in our hands as it is very flimsy , to the kitchen table after promptly evicting the father , who was trying to enjoy a quiet game of Angry Birds on his laptop . After explaining the importance of testing the product to the angry father ( `` It 's for science ! '' ) we reassembled the tracks and were about to test it on the hard surface of the table with the kids when we ran into another problem.I handed the Steve- er ... Lightning McQueen car to the youngest and reached into grab another one for the other- ... what the ? Where 's the other car ? The Speedway only comes with one car and replacement cars cost ... well ... you can get a few Matchbox cars for the same price . This was n't good as you ca n't have a race without two cars otherwise it 's a time trial and this is hardly Mario Kart . After a few seconds of thinking I asked the kids if they had any Matchbox cars to see if they could be used as substitutes . It was here that I found out WHY the Cars Stunt Racers were so expensive ; they 're proprietary and have pull-back motors ! This means they are specifically designed for the track and vice versa so nothing else will work on the track as we learned VERY quickly.I see your tricks Disney Toy Execs ! You clever fatherless people you ! THIS is how they tie you in to buy more stuff that is way overpriced and as flimsy as a bridge on the I-5 ! Seeing how this was not going to work with two children and I was NOT going to travel to the nearest department store to spend money on more cars , we let the children take turns and they got bored within minutes as there was nothing more to do than turn an annoying crank and watch a single car do the same thing every time . It became very repetitive and I can just imagine how long the flimsy power crank would last as it sounded like something from Frankenstein with every passing turn.Realizing that this toy would not last without a larger investment in more Disney Cars toys , I turned to the mother and asked a single question.Me : `` Do you guys have a Nintendo Wii ? `` Mother : `` Yes . `` Me : `` Mario Kart ? `` Mother : `` Of course ! `` Me : `` I challenge all of you ! `` Kids : `` Challenge accepted ! `` I lost ... darn kids ... All in all , this product is little more than an attempt by what I can only imagine as a bunch of pudgy , balding Disney Toy Execs to suck you in and buy more stuff . This toy is annoying to assemble , flimsy at best , and requires a larger investment to even begin to enjoy . Avoid ."}, "23741": {"id": "23740", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This track gets two stars from me because my son does think it 's cool ( he 's almost four and likes Cars , ) he likes the car itself , and because we ( adults ) have gotten at least some of the functionality to work some of the time . However , he 's never actually gotten it to work himself , so that I 'm surprised he was n't more disappointed . He 's mostly ignored the track after the first 24 hours and played with just the car.Putting the track together was n't impossible , but it was a challenge and the instructions were n't all that clear . ( `` Helpful hint '' to put on the stickers first would have been ridiculously hard . ) It holds together well enough to work , but tends to start coming apart quickly if it 's moved or if baby brother comes along.It was tough for me as a mom to figure out how to set up and use it ; the instructions offer practically no guidance as to what it 's supposed to do and how . My husband 's the only one out of the three of us that 's really gotten the car to loop the track . In fact , now that I look at other reviews , there are things I did n't even know it was supposed to do.One potential problem is that it has to be used on a hard , smooth surface - at the lower level the car runs on the floor rather than a track . Carpet , rug or probably tile would be problematic.A final drawback I see is that it 's a track to RACE cars , and of course only one car is included . To have a race you 'll need to pick up another vehicle in the set , likeDisney / Pixar CARS Stunt Racers Raoul CaRouleIt 's designed to launch two cars at once , though you can do just one.Amazon 's description says that it 's based off the movie Planes .

To use the `` bottom '' level of the track , you need to have a hard surface otherwise the car wo n't be able to make a circuit of the inner course . Also , since the launcher is not attached to the device ( so you can change the angle of entry ) a hard surface is also needed to reach the upper course levels.Second complaint , only one race car is provided with the toy . It 's hard to have a `` race '' when there 's no one to race against , and you ca n't substitute any Hot Wheels or Matchbox cars that you might have on hand.Third complaint , the assembly instructions were not very clear and the letter-marks on the pieces were sometimes hard to see/find . This is n't something that the kids can put together themselves.We never did ever get the car to run completely around the upper tracks , though it did make a nice figure-8 on the floor-level track . We just could n't get it to go fast enough to fully test the course.My recommendation ? Save your money . There are better toys out there . This could have been a great toy if more time had been taken with the instructions , with the propulsion method , with the operation of the upper levels , and with the inclusion of at least two cars . Car racing sets are easy to create but few are created well .

Sheesh . For this sincere limitation I subtract one star.Oh , and it also does n't work on carpets or rugs . *The bottom track does have a chance of working on a solid surface such as an oak floor or a tabletop that 's large enough and otherwise unneeded . Other surfaces it works on include a big mirror , a sheet of Lexan , the roof of a Humvee , and a freshly Zambonied ice skating rink , which , by the way , you wo n't be able to use for very long , at least not at Crown Center , before this sad-looking , slope-shouldered , 16-year-old comes slumping out onto the ice and tells you you ca n't set up your Disney/Pixar Cars Stunt Racers Double Decker Speedway there , `` not even in a corner .

To stage races one must drive to a store and spend money to get a second car or use Amazon or some similar online service and spend money to get a second car . Or you could do as I have done and fabricate one yourself , which I can now tell you takes a lot more time and money than you might originally have expected.This failure is plainly stated by the manufacturer right on the box and on the Amazon description page , so it 's not like customers can complain they were taken completely unawares , but it is still a failure , for which I subtract another star . *One more thing is , if you do n't have the added enjoyment of a race , after a pretty short time this toy becomes boring . Except for this one deal where you can alter the upper car 's course into a winner 's circle , it 's the same routine time after time .

Also , the freezer cartridge is small and could easily get lost in the freezer or thrown away - my husband had no clue what it was when he found it.You can use warm and cold water to achieve the changes , as well . There 's a makeup applicator which can be dampened with cold water and rubbed on her face .

Size-wise , it does n't take up very much space and the castle playset comes with everything your child will need to act out stories with the Barbie characters Mariposa and Catania . My daughter has never seen the Barbie Mariposa movies , and it has no impact whatsoever on her enjoyment of the playset . She has fun making up her own stories and moving the small figurines from one part of the castle to another.ASSEMBLY REQUIREDFor the most part , the set is almost fully put together when you remove it from the box . I appreciated I did n't have to attach any stickers to the playset because I can never get them as perfectly aligned and as smooth as I want . The plastic the pieces are made from is pretty thin , and it might be possible to damage it if you are n't careful when attaching them . Be sure to stick to the instruction 's guidelines , because most of the pieces do n't come out once you snap them in.The most difficult part for me was # 2 on the instruction , affixing the pink top floor to the white columns . This was easily the most frustrating part for me ; everything else was mostly straightforward , though there was confusion over which small decorative piece needed to go on top of the castle so the fairies could spin . Overall , it took maybe twenty or so minutes to get it all put together and the loose pieces into the castle where the box shows them.TINY PIECESTruly , I 'm surprised to see that this toy is recommended for ages three and up . There are so many tiny pieces for children to lose , and they could easily be swallowed by a child who has a habit of putting toys in his or her mouth . If you have older children at home as well as younger ones , keep this toy far away from the younger ones ! Also , you might think you are missing pieces in the set , but you are n't . The instruction guide says you have to attach some pieces to the bed , but upon closer inspection those pieces were already a part of the two beds . Those additional pieces are shown as separate attachments on the front of the pretty-much-useless pamphlet . Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the lack of a mirror for the upstairs of the castle . The box clearly shows one , so we thought we were missing a piece and I was going to write to Mattel and ask them for it . However , on the instruction guide where it shows all the pieces , no mirror is listed . I do n't know if there actually is supposed to be one , or if the instruction guide is wrong about this like it is about some of the other pieces too.QUALITYThe dolls included with this toy are a bit lower quality than I would have liked . They are barely a step up from the little plastic Barbie dolls that I 've seen in the impulse-buy area at the checkout at Target . We bought our daughter one of those dolls once and pieces of her neck started to break off . Of course , this upset my little girl . We glued the doll back together as best we could , but eventually I think the toy was thrown away . Hopefully these dolls will not suffer the same fate ; I hate seeing my daughter disappointed because companies do n't put much thought into the quality of their toys.TIPFor the spinner at the top of the castle , the dolls fit into them by snapping their chests to the seats . If you look closely , you 'll see that the `` seats '' are shaped exactly like Barbie 's chest area , so that 's where you snap them in.OVERALLUnfortunately , this is n't a must-have toy . It was aggravating to assemble , the quality of the toy leaves plenty to be desired , and the smaller pieces will be easy to lose track of if parents or child are not attentive to them ."}, "23807": {"id": "23806", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "My girls love it because it 's pink , and tiny and it 's so girly ...

Third , the posability initially looks promising but a little time spent with the figure reveals that the addition of double jointed knees does nothing towards dynamic poses and the lack of double joints in the elbows crushes any further possibility.Even Boba Fett can not hold his blaster rifle properly in two hands.Lastly , there are elements in the body sculpt that impede this posability - ankles do not allow for the feet to turn up even slightly to make the figure crouch , armor elements on Fett and the Sandtrooper get in the way of them doing - well , just about ANYTHING besides stand at attention . This does n't make a lot of sense when you consider the recent Hasbro Marvel Legends which are capable of a great many dynamic poses and are often weighted properly so they can stand unaided .

Inside , the smaller pieces are divided into plastic bags in a way that makes no sense whatsoever - basically you need to open every single bag before you can assemble even one portion of the final toy . The packaging engineers at Playmobil need to buy a few pieces of Ikea furniture and take a lot of notes about how to package in a logical , space-saving way that follows the chronology of assembly .

The band members , not so much . As others have mentioned , they 're all dudes , which is pretty outdated , and their outfits - OMG .

Set up is a snap ( we had Scout unboxed with the help of a scissors in less than 3 minutes ) . You begin by pressing a color coded button on Scout 's collar that corresponds to the cover the chosen book . He 's got a pleasant ( but somewhat on the loud side ) voice that sings songs , giggles when hugged , asks your child questions that relate to the story being read ( e.g . : `` Do you feel happy or sad ? When you feel grumpy , what helps you feel better ? `` ) , and of course reads one of five stories .

With a few taps , you can make it quiet so your child can explore the different musical notes and sounds , but unless you do , it 's just an endless loop of noise.There are three modes , 'Compose ' , 'Song ' , and 'Game'.Compose is a sort of free-for-all . It starts with the 'guitar ' loop playing , and kids can bang on the keys or the animals-with-instruments to add more noise.Song encourages kids to touch the different instruments to hear little samples of sound , or they can touch an animal-with-instrument to play a song . ( Now this would have been a great opportunity to actually teach something . If , for example , the keys lit up to show which note was being played in the song . But no , it just plays a song like 'twinkle twinkle ' . ) Game involves the device telling the user to touch a certain color . There are pretty much only two options - the key of that color , or the animal/instrument of that color .

When I was a kid ( over thirty years ago ) , Star Wars was one of my favorite things . It 's been that way ever since I saw Luke , Leia , Han , and Chewie take on the Galactic Empire on the small screen in the first film . I actually saw the original film in the theater , but I was literally just a few months old . It was n't until `` The Empire Strikes Back '' came out that I got to see my heroes ( and villains ) in all of their glory . When `` Return of the Jedi '' was released , I could n't wait to see what new adventures the Rebel Legion would have and George Lucas made sure that I left the theater a fat and happy kid.As most of you know , tons of new creatures were introduced such as the Ewoks and the denizens of Jabba 's Palace . A new type of trooper was introduced in that film as well , the Biker Scout . They wore more cloth than their Stormtrooper brethren , and rode on those really cool speeder bikes . I fell in love with the look of these troops immediately.Being the eager lad that I was , I asked my mom if she would buy me a Biker Scout toy and she complied . All these years later , I still have that figure . When I saw that Hasbro 's Black Series would include a Biker Scout , I figured it was time for me to get the newer model . All I have to say is that it was a huge let down.The figure 's paint scheme is terrible . The joints on the feet and shoulders are black , cutting into the pristine white I 'm used to seeing ( and which Kenner got correct on the original figure ) . Also , while I appreciate the multiple points of articulation , many of them are extremely loose . On top of that , the plastic casing was hanging off of the cardback when I received the figure . Now , this particular problem is not exclusive to the Biker Scout or the Black Series . The Saga Legends and Mission Series plastic casings are also poorly adhered to their respective cardbacks in the 2013 run of Hasbro 's Star Wars line . Still , it 's disappointing to see on what is supposed to be one of Hasbro 's higher end figures.The only accessory ( which I do n't actually mind a lack of ) is the Biker Scout 's blaster . It sort of fits in his boot holster but I had a hard time getting it to stay in his hand . It kept popping out no matter how I tried to maneuver it around in the hand.Overall , I wanted to love this figure , but poor articulation , horrible paint , and bad packaging make this a figure I 'm glad to have purchased at a heavily discounted price . If you feel like modifying this figure ( as in painting it to match the screen version ) , go ahead and buy it , but I would try to get it at a deep discount if I were you .

How does this product perform then ? For starters , the selling point is that this is designed for small hands and it is also mentioned this is supposed to be `` mess-free '' . Well , the size of the pad is just about perfect for a toddler , but it did feel just about right for my older kid ( 6 ) How does this work ? after installing three AA batteries ( not included , so keep that in mind if you get this ) you should be good to go . On the back of the pad there is an ON/OFF switch where you can select if you want color lights or color lights with music . Just to give you an idea we do not use the music at all , it is just too loud and there is no volume control to change that , also , like with any other similar toys , it gets repetitive and eventually , annoying.The way this is built so it is mess-free , is that the pad is made of a dark blue gel covered by a thin plastic layer , so by using the included stylus you basically draw by removing the gel . This is very practical and clean but as you can imagine , frustrating : since the pad is made out of gel , it is practically impossible to draw without the figures deforming . Also , once you 've used it , there is no easy way to restore the gel completely . You have to manually spread the gel , making all kinds of shapes with your hands in the process.After watching my kids play with this for a while I came to the following conclusion : younger kids ( 1-2 years old ) may feel drawn to the music and colors but not actually use it as intended . Older kids who could use it to actually draw things may end up frustrated because of the issues caused by the consistency of the gel on the screen . I guess what I am trying to say is that this may work better as a baby toy , but there are better baby toys out there than this one.I am giving this item two stars , but I will also say there are other Crayola products you can get on the same price range that may suit your needs better.One final comment , anyone else noticed how Amazon warns about the choking hazard and mentions this is not for kids under 3 ?

Take a crayon case , for example . Crayola , the KING of crayons , thought consumers would love a case to hold 152 crayons . I thought my kids would love it , too . After receiving it and trying it out , I can not help but think of all the cool things this case could have been , rather than just a yellow hunk of plastic that holds crayons.I normally like to point out all the great things about products , but this is an exception . Other than holding 152 crayons , this case really does not offer much . Instead , I will focus on all the things YOU WILL NOT FIND with this product , that would have been really neat.THINGS I WISH THIS CASE OFFERED , BUT IT DOES NOT:1 . Spinning/Carousel Base : It is impossible for a little one to see all the crayons that are arranged to face 4 different directions around the center of the case . So , why not make the case rotate , rather than making the kid walk around it or pick up the entire case ? 2 . Grouping/Organization : Rather than 152 colors dispersed somewhat randomly , why not use the case to help bring some sort of organization to the colors ? For instance , there is one box that is full of metallics . There is another box full of glitter crayons . However , the only way I knew this was by pulling out the individual crayons and using deductive reasoning . Why not label the groups and do more groups to help make sense of such a large assortment ? 3 . A Lid with a Clasp : There is a very cheap plastic lid with this case that I am certain will be discarded by most purchasers who think it is simply packing material -- not worthy of keeping for the long haul . However , if you do n't keep that cheap piece of plastic , then you have NO LID AT ALL . It would have been nice if they had thought about a case of crayons that will almost certainly be transported by a little one who might drop it.4 . Cooler Sharpener : This case has a sharpener , but it is inconveniently located in the middle of the case , and it is sunken down low . It really is n't even all that easy to see . Then , to sharpen a crayon , a kid must hold the crayon vertically and turn it . Sure , all of this is possible , but with a big case like this , a better solution could have been designed that is easier to access and use.5 . Refill Friendly Design : My kids use washable crayons , which do not come with this case . However , the only way that I could put their crayons into this case would be to buy 16-count boxes of crayons , as this case is really only designed to hold that size of box ( actually , there is one box in the case that holds 24 , but the rest hold 16 crayons ) . Practically speaking , the life of this case is going to be pretty short if it is not easy to refill with one 's own crayons down the road.In summary , if you are just looking for a throw-away plastic case full of 152 crayons , then this product is for you . If , on the other hand , you are hoping for a case that is designed to stand the test of time and provide some unique and useful features and benefits for your little ones , you 'll be disappointed like me ."}, "23900": {"id": "23899", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "My young daughter is a big fan of products such as this , and even takes orders from her classmates for the creation of custom jewellery.Unfortunately , this product was a disappointment for her - the instructions were just too vague ( even with me helping ) and the product too cumbersome - to come out with any keepers.~A_E~"}, "23901": {"id": "23900", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Let me start out by saying I am of the shrinky-dink generation - and puffy paint - and paper mache masks using white glue and newspapers ( or globes using a balloon if you want to get fancy ) . I would like to believe that I am somewhat able to succeed at a kid craft especially when under the direction of a cool-under pressure able-to-whittle 9 year old , but I failed at this - mostly because I found it frustrating . The offspring persevered and was rewarded with some color swirl blobs pierced through the center and placed on the Peacock stand alongside my puce colored beauties . They had lovely puce color variations within though.Getting started:1 ) The Peacock stand was assembled by the offspring in about 45 seconds sans instructions . It was simple and keeps the bead holes open while they dry . I have no complaints about the Peacock stand aside from the fact it is now adorning my dining room buffet alongside her mantids and their required fruit flies . So yes , keep in mind this requires drying and space for drying ... and may end up living in space you did not intend to populate with kid stuff.2 ) The roller apparatus is preassembled . We were up and running in under 5 minutes . We are girls who appreciate instant gratification and were happy with unpacking and mostly lack of extra packing materials ( although I wish they used reclosable bags for the supplies ) 3 ) Kit components include pink , blue , yellow , and purple clay , some pendant holders , clay punches , a device for hole poking , plastic clunky bracelet clasps , elastic and string ( I am not clearly not employed in marketing ) .4 ) The instructions are ... minimal ... and clearly supposed to be written for the offspring 's benefit ( about a 3rd grade reading level , laid out fairly nicely ) except they bounce around a lot ( e.g . if you are making a swirl bead do steps 1-2 for regular beads , then swirl , then repeat steps 3-4 ... ) - flattening position versus rolling position could have used a picture for the younger crowd . No instructions for round ( obvious ) and square ( obvious enough for us , but maybe not for a younger child ? ) beads . A couple ok project ideas.5 ) I like the clay . It is vibrant and soft ; it is not so messy or crumbly ( just be aware of the `` may permanently stain ! '' warning when choosing location ) .Making stuff:1 ) We decided by committee that the pendants were clunky . Most of this decision arrived from why do you have to flatten with the roller then smoosh it in the pendant holder . Pointless - and clunky . We did not like clunky . However , these are easy enough to make , but remember there are only a few.2 ) Onto beads : 1 ) choose 2 colors 2 ) Use hole in crank arm of roller to size the pieces 3 ) roll the pieces and align them 4 ) turn roller to standing position 5 ) insert clay in back and crank away from you 6 ) put roller flat 7 ) put flattened clay in back and roll out - in theory the flattened piece will hit the bottom roller , push against it and coil ... . which brings us to 8 ) take flattened coil out , repeat 7 , repeat 8 ... 9 ) eventually put pressure on bottom roller have some success albeit with now puce clay 10 ) realize pressure did not work and manually start coils 11 ) realize it was easier ( and less error/offset coils ) to just roll by hand . 12 ) punch hole ( no problems here but hole is big ) and 13 ) add to peacock rack to dry3 ) Embossing clay : there are pretty designs lightly etched on the sides of the roller apparatus . According to the instructions you can use this to emboss your coils . However ... they are so subtle that no matter how we tried the result in the clay was faint as to hardly see and then was marred as soon as we touched it . It could be there is a magic time during the hardening process that you can properly emboss the clay without cracking it using too much force . However , if this was meant for embossing the design should have been more prominent.6 ) Glazing : subtle sheen and glitter . No problems - it is drippy so plan accordingly . The peacock holder was helpful for glazing . Clear nail polish with added glitter I think would be cool to try.Bottom line : I think there few supplies included for what you actually get - although I was for whatever reason enamored with the stand ( it did not tip over and it actually worked ) . This is more of a `` getting started '' pack , but I could easily see a crafter using these up in one sitting . I found the coiling frustrating using the roller . The roller is good for flattening . I asked the offspring what she thought and she said it was fun to do with me but she thought it was kind of dumb and not anything she would wear ( so maybe 9 too old ? ) . She did not think this would be a good gift for her friends or her younger cousin ( 6 ) . She thought her younger cousin would not be able to follow the directions and would not be able to roll the beads . Maybe so . Maybe not . YMMV . So for us , this was not a win as a rolling pin , toothpick , and better jewelry supplies would have gotten better results for less money . It is not worth the current list price . So , bottom line - no I would not recommend this unless the roller is modified so that it can grab clay better and has deeper embossing indentations .

I asked my son what his favorite part of the toy was and he said `` throwing my castle at your castle to knock it apart . `` Here are a few Bullet Points of Frustration : -The instructions are minimal . We spent most of the first 15 minutes trying to figure out why the Morphix was stuck in the molds , we could n't get them out , despite vigorous banging on the play mat ( which put dozens of little dents in it ) . Could n't they give some tips on this and other related subjects ? -The morphix itself is weird , and even after extensive kneading , still shed some of its sand/grit , which ultimately required a vacuum at clean up.-Once you 've made your shape and gotten it out , there 's about an 85 % chance it 's going to get squished in some way within moments of getting it out of the mold.-the catapults will only toss something that 's within a mm or two of an exact size , so stock up on ammo , and re-shape it frequently-you ca n't use the catapult with 1 finger like in the picture on the instructions . you need both hands.-the morphix does n't hold together after an hour or two , with handling pieces start to flake off.-there 's no easy way to get the packaging back together after you 're done with it . It took both of us and a Houdini-like flourish to get it all in there ... . then a few minutes later when we found a Morphix catapult bomb a few feet away , we both decided just to throw it out rather than risk having to pick everything up again.There would be so many ways to improve this toy .

I would tend to have 5 or 6 year olds on up and then also have my doubts concerning anyone over 14 , but as usual children are different . My 10 year old grandson turned his nose up at these and left his 8 year old brother to have his fun with itAlso realize , these are not building blocks , it is a gritty play dough type material which , even with the included play mats can create more of a mess than a parent or grandparent might be happy with . I did not appreciate all the ` crumbles ` that were created during play and during the construction of the blocks.The art work on the box is misleading ; the blocks are not even an inch tall . The blocks did not knock over very easily with the ` boulders ' that were catapulted at them . The plastic molds that you put the substance in does not always want to release the blocks and I vetoed the idea of using spray cooking oil , which just would have added to the mess.Sad to say , between the mess and the small rubbery type blocks , which my grandsons agreed ... that this would have been more fun with heavier plastic blocks , this seems to be an almost one use toy ."}, "23951": {"id": "23950", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "It probably makes great markers , but we never even got that far .

I thought they were dried out but bought some more and they were the same on this set . My 3 year old grandson played with it and mostly enjoyed the way you had to prime the eraser to remove the color from the slate . It is a sturdy toy and fits nicely on his lap but is so disappointing not having markers that color brightly !"}, "23954": {"id": "23953", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This is one horrible product ! It 's rare that I 'm THIS disappointed in a toy for my children.These markers are so light when used that your child can barely see what they 've drawn ! It 's about as much fun as using a white crayon on a sheet of white paper , which is frustrating to a child ! After a few minutes , both of my oldest boys ( 2 and 4 ) ended up just playing with the markers and stacking them on top of each other or putting them in their `` holding '' spot on the desk . Drawing , which is the purpose of this desk , was n't the least bit of fun for them.Since this was such a disappointment , I decided to take a chance on dry erase markers . Dry Erase markers **DO NOT** work with this desk ! It does n't come off . I 'll keep trying to clean our board , and if I find something that works , I 'll come back and let you know . Truly , THAT will be this toy 's only saving grace . Otherwise , it 's a total waste of money ! About the only thing I do like is the storage areas included . On the back of the desk , there is a holding spot for everything , except the washcloth . While in use , there 's holding spots for the 4 markers that are included.Another huge disappointment is that magic eraser . The magic solution looks a great deal like a bit of dishwashing liquid and water . When it runs out , though , it 's gone . I twisted and turned and tried everything , short of breaking it , to get the magic eraser open for a refill . Apparently , it does n't come open ! I searched and could n't find replacements , either . Such a disappointment ! ! Overall , I ca n't recommend this product , unfortunately ."}}
