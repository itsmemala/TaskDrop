It is odd that since Booth knows Pelant is a electronics wizard and can hack into just about any video system and watch people , that Boothnever had the FBI come and run a electronic screening of his house . He knew from previous episodes that Pelant his been in his house ; he changed theclock in Booths bedroom presumably with one with a bug or a bomb in it .

I do n't know why we have to watch Camille run around with the Iranianwho does n't look like and Iranian : I mean who cares ?

I think the producers should trim the cast a bit : send the loony intern back to the hospital , send Edison the the Natural History museum inChicago where he can stare at the Breasts of the dinosaurs and BRING BACK ZACH ! !

It was n't as if this woman made a ton of money , working for the Beatles ' management and running their fan club from 1963 to 1972 . But , just like Pete Best , who kept any dirt to himself despite being fired as the band 's drummer just as they got a recording contract and went on to unmatched success , Kelly resisted the payday of saying what the Beatles would n't want said . That Kelly started working for their management at age 17 and eleven years later stepped down to start a family impresses me that much more . There must have been tempting offers to blab but despite having children to worry about , this woman , still younger than 30 years of age , said no to the money.On one of the Beatles fan club Christmas records the band gives Kelly what today is known as a shout out , thanking her for running their fan club . `` Good ol ' Freda , '' one or more yell . It was as if they knew she would prove loyal.Fifty years after she started working for the Beatles , who knew anyone would think Freda Kelly would make for a fine documentary subject ? See GOOD 'OL FREDA . And this is no lame cable television channel-type piece . The makers of GOOD OL ' FREDA do a first-rate job . Of note , the opening song to support the action is `` Anna '' but not the Beatles ' version ; rather , it is the original , by Arthur Alexander . The same goes for `` Chains '' by the Cookies , `` Honey , Do n't '' by Carl Perkins and a number of others the band covered that we hear throughout the movie . Beatles songs such as `` I Will '' are included , too , no small feat when you consider it is rare for a Beatles recording to be used in a movie soundtrack.The most telling GOOD OL ' FREDA passage : Freda Kelly reminisces about the Beatles while seated alongside boxes of memorabilia in her attic . That 's right ; she does not have all that stuff on display in her home . It 's in storage . While she has n't thrown away souvenirs from her years with the greatest musical act in history , Kelly knows their place is in her past . GOOD OL ' FREDA conducts that interview in the attic where she 's stored those collectables , as if to make sure we understand there is more to this woman than the stories she could tell about John , Paul , George , and Ringo.Oddly , longtime Beatles assistant Mal Evans is missing from the list of those that were lost in Freda Kelly 's life , which starts with Brian Epstein , continues through John Lennon and George Harrison , and wraps up with Neil Aspinall and Derek Taylor.When Freda Kelly could have picked up a nice paycheck , she said nothing . Five decades later - and what must be many years since the last time anyone approached her about a tell-all book - with two of the Beatles gone and , I 'd guess , not many fans who wonder what became of that `` Freda '' the Beatles mentioned in that Christmas record , GOOD OL ' FREDA finally tells what Kelly is willing to say .

Magnolia films has been making a name for itself in releasing music related documentaries ( & # 8220 ; Muscle Shoals & # 8221 ; was also at the April WXPN festival & # 8211 ; and I did catch it and it & # 8217 ; s great & # 8211 ; and Magnolia will be releasing it in January ( hopefully with lots of bonuses ) . But back to Freda.As David pointed out in his review , there is a wonderful commentary track that reveals more stories than are shone in the film . But , remember that Freda was a loyal dedicated secretary for 11 years ( one year LONGER than the Beatles were together as a band ) and no real secrets are revealed . But , when she discusses the parents of the & # 8220 ; boys & # 8221 ; & # 8211 ; especially weekly teas with Ringo & # 8217 ; s mom ( she only refers to Ringo as & # 8220 ; Ringo & # 8221 ; in the Q & A ; at at Beatlefest - included as a bonus ; in the film he is always called & # 8220 ; Richie & # 8221 ; and Brian Epstein is called & # 8220 ; Eppie & # 8221 ; - you get a deeper feeling for the family life of the Fab Four.In one of the bonus interviews with the Director of the film , we learn that he shot 50 hours of film and says that he hopes that much of it would be on the DVD release . But there are only five scenes totaling just 12 minutes . ( I & # 8217 ; m not complaining & # 8211 ; just commenting ) .As noted by others & # 8211 ; four Beatles songs are included in the soundtrack , along with a bunch of classic songs that the Beatles covered ( by Arthurs Alexander , The Chiffons , Marvelettes ) including the most expensive to license : Ketty Lester & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; Love Letters & # 8221 ; . Oddly enough the Lester recording was not remastered and has lots of & # 8220 ; crackle & # 8221 ; . Surely they could have found a better copy to use . ( again , a comment , not a complaint.So , in summary , all Beatles fans will want this Bluray , even if you have seen the film at a festival . And , even if you are a casual music listener who grew up with their music , you & # 8217 ; ll find the 87-minute film and its bonuses , worth watching.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm & # 8220 ; Anything Phonographic & # 8221 ;"}, "24099": {"id": "24098", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is a story of Freda Kelly , who was the official fan club leader and secretary of the Beatles . In 1962 she was recruited by the Beatles manager Brian Epstein to work for the band when she was a 17-year-old Liverpool typist and a regular audience at the Cavern Club , and continued to be in office until 1972 . In the documentary she recalls the early days of her eventful life with the world & # 8217 ; s most famous band.In fact , most probably avid Beatles fans ( including me ) might have heard what she has to say somewhere before . The personalities of the Fab Four she describes ( George is the quiet Beatle , etc . ) are nothing surprising , but episodes about the family members of the group are interesting , especially when recounted by the very person who personally knew them.Other interviewees include Tony Barrow ( Beatles press officer ) , Billy Kinsley of The Merseybeats ( and director Ryan White & # 8217 ; s nephew ) , Billy Hatton and Joey Bower of The Fourmost , and Angie McCartney . What they say has more to do with Freda than the Beatles , so don & # 8217 ; t expect much.It is a bit surprising that the filmmakers are allowed to use four original Beatle songs for the movie . Though Paul McCartney only appears in archive footage , Ringo Starr himself shows up before the camera , giving a brief message to Freda and fans , which proves that she has been a trusted friend of the group.Though & # 8220 ; Good Ol ' Freda & # 8221 ; does not offer new things very much , it gives a new viewpoint for us to watch the history of the band ."}, "24100": {"id": "24099", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "First a disclaimer : if you 've led a sheltered existence or believe that some ancient text originating from a tribe of goat herders in a remote desert millennia ago contains everything you need to know about life , you might not want to watch this film . Why ? Because it 's about real life . There 's no rubbishy faux emotions , nonsense plot , huge CGI effects , or endless car chases and gun battles . It 's a real movie about real people . The direction and camerawork are all put to the service of the story and the acting , which places this movie in the same category as The Lives of Others and House of Sand and Fog . You need an attention span to watch this film . You need to let it carry you along at its own pace , devoid of snappy jump-cuts and mindless action scenes.Some reviewers seem to have had problems dealing with the subject , which is simply that the teenage sons of two life-long friends fall in love , each with the mother of the other . Apparently this scenario is n't covered in the Big Hollywood/Disney Book of Life . Fortunately the film makers were n't overly concerned with limited conceptions of human feeling , and this movie gracefully explores - without gloss or varnish - the joys and the pains of what follows in consequence . Any middle-aged person who 's ever felt the stirrings of attraction for a younger person will sympathize with the magnetic pull of this dynamic , and any young person who 's ever felt attracted to a more mature person will likewise know the feeling of wanting to & # 34 ; own & # 34 ; that person and monopolize their attention.And anyone who 's ever experienced any kind of affair will know about the tribulations that can result , due to the expectations and attitudes of others.What 's lovely about this movie is that it explores all the avenues - the women 's insecurities about their age , overlaying their knowledge that what they have , though marvelous , is necessarily fleeting . The young men unconsciously playing at being older than their years . The reactions of outsiders . The unintentional cruelties of love and obsession . It 's all explored delicately but without flinching.The acting is very good . The initial hesitation that ultimately gives way to uncontrolled passion is very well done . The insecurities , jealousies , and inevitable pain is also beautifully rendered , always understated . There 's no intrusive & # 34 ; mood music & # 34 ; to tell us what to feel . There 's just a balanced character study that unfolds ineluctably , always watchable and always poignant.If you want to learn about human nature - real human nature , not the paper nonsense of DisneyWood - this is a great little movie . Plus the scenery is stunning and should make almost everyone want to pack up and move to Australia ."}, "24101": {"id": "24100", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I watched this film on Saturday and it is now Wednesday and I am stilling thinking about it . This is an Australian film , so the pace of the story is somewhat different ... the crescendos are quieter but the sentinel events are clear .

Fine performances by all the major players : Though more character and conflict development may seem needed at times , we get to know everyone and everything gradually , and the fact that they are all just fairly `` normal '' ( whatever that is ) people is pivotal . Not the greatest script , but it 's nothing if not realistic.Regarding the plot : The way the quadrangle develops is pretty convincing . Even if what 's happening here is nothing illegal , it 's obviously weird if not downright perverse . Yet , I was surprised to find myself rooting for both couples as ADORE proceeded , wanting them all to be happy together . The way the two women bear a superficial resemblance to each other , causing us to occasionally forget who 's whose mum and who 's whose lover , is another interesting effect . Finally , the isolated cove with its stationary sun-raft is a fitting and well-chosen symbol.Though it 's obviously not a `` family film '' or one for younger children , there is no gore , serious nudity ( just a couple of brief booty-shots of Robin Wright and Xavier Samuel ) , or other flinchable elements ( unless you count the multiple unexplicit sex scenes ) .ADORE is one of the strongest , most satisfying films to come out in recent years , and I enjoyed it immensely ."}, "24105": {"id": "24104", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "They carry this thing as far as it can be carried .

Their lifeseems idyllic : Roz runs an art-gallery , while Lil apparently does notwork but manages quite well to pursue a good life as a widow . As thefilm develops , however , so both women fall for the other woman 's sons : Roz falls in love with Lil 's son Tom ( James Frechville ) , and Lil fallsin love with Roz 's son Ian ( Xavier Samuel ) . Both women try to end theirrespective affairs - in the belief that they are somehow wrong - butfind themselves incapable of doing so , leading to heartache and loss.There are several reasons for watching TWO MOTHERS : the first being thestunning photography of a rural seaside landscape ( by ChristopheBeaucarne ) , full of sandy beaches and azure-blue seas . It 's hardlysurprising that none of the four protagonists really want to leave theplace , even though Tom moves briefly to urban Sydney to pursue a careeras a theater director . TWO MOTHERS also boasts four excellentperformances : Watts and Wright are quite outstanding as the twomothers , their faces beginning to show the signs of middle age , yetretaining much of their youthful vigor . Director Anne Fontaine 's camerascrutinizes their features as they ponder the morality of what they aredoing , and desperately decide what to do for the best , while remainingtrue to their instincts . At the end of the film , when they considerwhat they have done , they do not say much , but the sequence comesacross as incredibly poignant : Wright in the foreground , and Watts inthe background trying to explain why she did what she did . The thirdmain reason for watching the film is the sparse script - by Fontaineand Christopher Hampton after a work by Doris Lessing . The film makesno judgment on the characters ' behavior ' ; rather it encourages us toreflect on how human emotions work , often in defiance of moralconcerns . Perhaps the film is a touch too long - the ending tends todrag a little - but the final image of the four protagonists sittingsunbathing on a wooden raft , the camera placed directly above them , isa memorable one ."}, "24107": {"id": "24106", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Man , this movie keeps you guessing , builds great tension , and has some of the best moments I 've seen all year .

The two woman still beautiful , and coming into their prime sexual age . It is by accident that the relationships begin , but they find them so enjoyable , they ca n't stop . But what is missed is that both boys go on and find young women their own age and soon father their own children . What is never explored is what did the boys learn from their tutors . They were good husbands , despite their trysts with the older women . A young man needs an older woman to teach him how to satisfy a woman . We do n't know anything , and understand less , and by the time we learn how to do it correctly , we are too old to do it right . This is not the same with a young girl .

Knowing that it is both loved and hated depending on the degree of appreciation for experimental film should be the driving force as to whether or not to take advantage witnessing this brave new film.In New South Wales , Roz ( Robin Wright ) , her husband Harold ( Ben Mendelsohn ) and their son Tom ( James Frecheville ) live near the beach . Lil , ( Naomi Watts ) who is a widow , lives nearby with her son Ian ( Xavier Samuel ) . Roz and Lil are best friends , and so are Tom and Ian . Harold applies for and is offered a job in Sydney without telling Roz . He expects Roz to move to Sydney with him , however , she hesitates . After a night of drinking quite unexpectedly on the surface Ian and Roz start a sexual relationship . Tom discovers this and takes revenge by initiating a sexual relationship with Lil . Now Roz has even more reason to stay , and later Roz and Harold divorce . Two years of these two mothers/best friend 's sons affairs pass but not without the inference that Roz and Lil are lesbians - a way for Lil to avoid the approach of a suitor Saul ( Gary Sweet ) . Harold returns from Sydney and his new highly enviable job in the theater department and discovers the affairs and summarily absents himself from the situation and from Roz . There are hesitations , but these do not last long and the secret relationships continue . Eventually Tom goes to Sydney for a promising job interview in the theater . His visit to Sydney changes everything for four of them - the nasty truth has its way to come out and alter everybody 's happy lives . The rest of the film is a rapidly moving progression of changing affinities and eventual strange resolutions.The nuanced performances by Robin Wright and Naomi Watts are brilliant and very equally balanced with the sensuous and realistic portrayals By Xavier Samuel and James Frecheville . The chemistry is extraordinary and credible and makes what could have been a strained story work meticulously well . The cinematography by Christophe Beaucarne and the musical score by Christopher Gordon enhance the liquid flow of this stunning film . The story and the film itself require an emotionally mature audience able to accept variations on the themes of love and lust , but given there are mores to overcome , this is a brilliant art piece .

Adapted from the short story & # 34 ; Grandmothers & # 34 ; by Doris Lessing this thing was then transformed into a scenario by being re-written and & # 34 ; upgraded & # 34 ; by French director Anne Fontaine , who specialises in quite peculiar and sometimes also slightly erotic films , like 2003 & # 34 ; Nathalie & # 34 ; ( re-made for Anglo-Saxon public in 2009 as & # 34 ; Chloe & # 34 ; - see my review of this film ) .The film is slow and calm , using a rather minimalistic approach of acting , with quite a lot of nice shots of sea and sandy beaches - and it actually is one of the best things in it , as I found it strangely soothing , notwithstanding anything else what happens on the screen . In many other films ( especially French ones ) this kind of approach produces just boredom - but here it actually felt just right ... Without entering into details let 's just say that this story is quite steamy and kinky , describing an unusual social and sexual situation - which is quite disturbing . To make the things clear , it is NOT the relationship between a young man and an older woman that disturbed me in this film but the serious collateral damage caused by it to some completely innocent women and children , who just happened to be secondary characters ...

You see , it would n't have worked unless both women/sons were doing it . It would have ignited jealousy between the sons , for one would be losing his mother to his friend . It would have bred resentment between the women , for one would be losing her son to her friend .

You get three guesses , and the first two guesses do n't count.And yes , I had to watch it . With a title like & # 34 ; Big Ass Spider ! , & # 34 ; who could possibly resist ? It 's pretty much exactly the movie that that amazing title promises -- a modern B-movie creature feature , centering on a monstrous spider that just keeps getting bigger and bigger . And while you might initially suspect that it 's a SyFy-style disaster , it 's also a very well-made film.It opens in the middle of a scene you 'd expect of such a movie -- a blimp-sized spider destroying a skyscraper , while helicopters buzz around helplessly . Exterminator Alex Mathis ( Greg Grunberg ) watches helplessly , while Storm Large 's hauntingly pretty cover of & # 34 ; Where Is My Mind ? & # 34 ; plays.Skip back to a day before . In the middle of an autopsy , a rat-sized spider crawls out of a corpse and attacks the mortician . Alex happens to be there getting a spider-bite treated , so he 's willing to handle the giant spider if they drop his bill . Along with security guard Jose ( Lombardo Boyar ) , he ventures into the depths of the hospital ... only to find that the spider has gotten much , much bigger . Also , it can melt off your face.Then a Special Forces unit shows up to take over the hospital , trying to find and lock down the spider before it can get any bigger . Big shock : they fail , and the spider becomes larger and larger , killing countless people as it goes . It falls to Alex , with his encyclopedic knowledge of spiders and their ways , to find a way to take it down before it has a bunch of spider babies ! & # 34 ; Big Ass Spider ! & # 34 ; basically wants to be a modern version of those 1950s creature movies with giant bugs and spiders . In that way , it succeeds -- it avoids being campy or overly silly , but still sticks earnestly to the & # 34 ; giant spider destroys everything & # 34 ; plotline that is so hard to pull off . Admittedly it could have been a bit more self-aware of its goofy storyline , but it 's pretty fun.But there is plenty of quick clever dialogue ( & # 34 ; Your Spanglish is pressuring me ! & # 34 ; ) and some tongue-in-cheek humor ( Alex decides to ram the spider with his pickup truck ) , keeping the pace going between action scenes . And yes , there are plenty of scenes of people being squished , melted and swarmed by the acid-spewing , hyper-webbing Big Ass Spider.It should also be noted that this is a pretty low-budget movie ; director Mike Mendez could n't afford a casting director , so he actually cast people from his Facebook friends list . Considering that budget , the special effects are pretty decent -- the spider is no Shelob , but it 's good for what it is , and it has a certain Harryhausen charm . Plus , it 's fun to see it repeatedly stabbing people with its spearlike legs.The actors all do a pretty decent job -- Grunberg is a fairly nice everyman hero , as the only one who knows enough about spiders to track the Big Ass Spider ! down . Lin Shaye is a bit wooden at times ( & # 34 ; I 'm stuck & # 34 ; ) but is a serviceable hard-nosed love interest , while Boyar manages to be comic relief without being ridiculous . Perennial cult star Ray Wise ( you know , the devil from & # 34 ; Reaper & # 34 ; ) also gives us a nice performance as the harried Special Forces general.In other words , if the SyFy Channel 's slapdash careless approach to creature features annoys you , this may be a welcome break .

Every scene he 's not in , soars . Every scene he is in , plummets . Loved the spider , could n't stand him . On the other hand , his unofficial sidekick ( Lombardo Boyar ) was funny and knew exactly how not to overplay his lines .

No , it isn & # 8217 ; t an earthquake . It isn & # 8217 ; t a tsunami . It isn & # 8217 ; t the Obama Administration . Rather , a secret government project has somehow been outsmarted ( why does that always happen ? ) , and a giant , hungry spider is roaming the streets . When all else fails & # 8211 ; when our government can & # 8217 ; t even begin to get things back under control & # 8211 ; mankind & # 8217 ; s only hope takes the shape of Alex Mathis ( played to near-perfection by a goofy Greg Grunberg ) , a crack exterminator , and his wise-cracking sidekick Jose Ramos , an armed hospital security guard . Together , they & # 8217 ; ll do what the United States military can & # 8217 ; t & # 8230 ; or they & # 8217 ; ll die trying ! Look . I & # 8217 ; m not going to try to convince you otherwise . As I said , the name of the flick & # 8211 ; BIG ASS SPIDER ! & # 8211 ; really should tell you everything about this motion picture that you need to know . It & # 8217 ; s all wry , sly , and witty from start to finish . The special effects ? Well , they & # 8217 ; re not STAR WARS quality , but they work just fine for what they were intended to do . They & # 8217 ; re good CGI , not grand . The story ? Oh , of course , it isn & # 8217 ; t perfect , but it & # 8217 ; s probably fairly close to what scribe Gregory Gieras intended with some modest ad-libs by everyone on the set.But the experience ? Anyone who celebrates B movies should recognize a quality effort , and that & # 8217 ; s what SPIDER is : hands down , it & # 8217 ; s probably some of the most fun that a cast , crew , and audience had together . Grunberg & # 8211 ; who & # 8217 ; s had solid cameo works in more than a handful of major productions & # 8211 ; is clearly the ringleader here , and he attacks it all with a kinda/sorta chunky Bill Murray quality . He manages to lift every scene he & # 8217 ; s in to a level higher probably because of his goofiness . And Boyar & # 8211 ; as his quick-witted partner & # 8211 ; only lets a few good opportunities escape a witticism from him . And veteran character actor Ray Wise as Major Braxton Tanner & # 8211 ; ultimately the man responsible for both letting the spider get away as well as marshaling the effort to see it stopped & # 8211 ; is about as brilliant as casting work one could expect from B movie greatness.All in all , this is a wonderful time at the movies . It & # 8217 ; s the kind of flick that isn & # 8217 ; t too long ( 80 minutes ) and is best served with a bowl of popcorn and a couple of beers . Leave your brain at the door . You & # 8217 ; re not going to need it.BIG ASS SPIDER ! ( 2013 ) is produced by Epic Pictures Group , Wittgenstein Entertainment , Film Entertainment Services , ICE Animations , and Snowfort Pictures . DVD distribution is being handled by Epic Pictures . As for the technical specifications , I & # 8217 ; m going to be perfectly honest : this is a B movie , and , as such , you can expect for very high quality B movie sights and sounds to dictate your experience & # 8211 ; there were some minor instances of audio varying on the dialogue track that became a bit distracting in the first half , but it did seem to work itself out in the latter . ( It could & # 8217 ; ve used a better mixer . ) And & # 8211 ; say it isn & # 8217 ; t so ! & # 8211 ; there & # 8217 ; s actually an assortment of special features including cast interviews , TV spots , trailers , a SXSW featurette , and something resembling a commentary track.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . B-movie patrons and makers could all benefit from a quick study : watch BIG ASS SPIDER ! and take its sensibilities to heart . Clearly , everyone associated with this film ( the screenwriter , the director , the cast and crew , etc . ) knew precisely what they were doing , understood precisely what they wanted to achieve , and then delivered on their collective promise to deliver exactly the kind of movie that a network like SyFy Channel would benefit from following . Everything is tongue-in-cheek , from the established movie science right down to the winning performances by Greg Grunberg and Lombardo Boyar . There & # 8217 ; s no doubt in my mind all associated with this had a blast making it ; it & # 8217 ; s the kind of satisfying experience lesser movies should strive for ! Bravo , director Mendez , for bringing it all together ! Now & # 8230 ; let & # 8217 ; s see a sequel !

Those schlocky sci-fi/horrors of the 1950s were often unintentionally funny but always entertaining . Big Ass Spider is a throwback to those films but with a Tremors style brand of humor . Greg Gunberg ( Heroes ) stars as Alex Mathis , an exterminator who specializes in & # 8220 ; getting into the heads of spiders & # 8221 ; . Mathis ends up at a hospital after being bit by one of his prey . The military arrives on the scene with Ray Wise as Major Tanner and Clare Kramer ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) as Lieutenant Brant , looking for a body that was delivered to the morgue in error.The body was home to a spider , genetically manipulated with microbes found in Martian soil which cause the spider to grow exponentially . Mathis , and hospital security guard Jose ( Boyar ) team-up to hunt down the arachnid , unaware of its true nature . The spider grows from the size of a small dog , to the size of a man , to that of a large dinosaur as it wreaks destruction in downtown Los Angeles . As the military fails to control the giant spider , it is up to Alex and Jose to kill the beast before it can lay its eggs.Big Ass Spider is heavily influenced by both Arachnophobia and Tremors , both of which are superior films . Its special effects are strictly Sy-Fy Channel quality and this would be the type of film you would expect to find on that network were it not for the quality of the cast . Grundberg and Boyer are the most enjoyable monster-hunting team to come along since Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon joined forces for Tremors in 1990 . They share playing straight man and comic foil equally and deliver more laughs than the film has a right.Ray Wise and his electric smile never fail to entertain . While he might not be believable as a military commander he still commands every scene he is in . The always wacky Lin Shaye has bit role as Alex & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; favorite & # 8221 ; customer .

So I 'll keep it short . I have always thought James Spader was a great actor . I think you give him any role and this guy can elevate it . I cant imagine anyone else for this role . For those who have not seen any of it yet , I would say watch the first three shows , if your not hooked by then ? It just may not be for you . You have the FBI , And the CIA involved so you get a lot of action scenes , you have Spaders character and another character Lizzy who is a government official , and the show revolves around these two characters . I am telling you , look at other reviews , you have mystery , plots that twist and turn , tons of questions that just keep you guessing and wanting more , and the week does not go fast enough so you can watch what happens next . You have an all star cast , But Spader really is a powerful character in this show , and I would say he even holds back a little , meaning his presence could be so powerful that the other characters could get swallowed up by him . But the writers and Spader leave plenty of room for you to connect with the other characters . If you love mystery novels or shows , DRAMA for sure , absolutely perfect writing , and there is no one particular story line . There are so many different story 's , so many twists , you never know which road your on until they want you to know , and you know they are just leading you on this roller coaster of emotions during the telling of this mystery of a story . There are so many parts , and eventually most likely at the end of the series , everything will be tied up before they call it quits . But the ride to get there is going to be one of the most entertaining and on the edge of your seat rides you will be on while you watch this show . I say give this a chance . Watch it through 3 episodes and see what you think . If you look , you will see most people love this show . I watch the Following , and I am a loyal fan of that show . And I am a huge fan of Kevin Bacon 's movies , but the Blacklist is just number 1 in my book . You find out what the Blacklist is very early on , as in the first or second episode . Start from the beginning , and Most will not be able to stop . You will either catch up with season 1 which has ended , on Amazon or you will order the DVD . This is a show that does not come along very often . Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue , Friends , Cheers , Seinfeld , Mash , and I can go on . This show is one of those . Just different material . You would be missing out on something really special with this show . Give it a shot . You wont be sorry . I guess you can call it a crime Drama , with a ton of mystery that you only find out a little at a time .

The revelation he is either the father of our agent Keene or her rescuer from the flames of her childhood home is something to keep us hooked . It 's too obvious for me to believe Berlin is her father . But , the passing moments of restrained humanity on Spader 's face in the later episodes is relief and redemption not only for the character he plays but for his skill as an actor .

They have n't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras . I 'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Do n't get me wrong -- the first season was terrific for the most part . This set ( like the first season set ) features the moving `` The Man Who Was Never Born '' with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world . Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere ( among his best ) , this was `` The Outer Limits '' as its best . Also we get `` The Galaxy Being '' with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death . David McCallum in `` The Sixth Finger '' about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how , in the process , we lose the essence of what makes us human . `` The Zanti Misfits '' like much of Stefano 's work provides a neat allegory about human nature .

In August you can get the second half of the first season . I 'm at a loss here -- why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package ? The only reason is so that retailers ( such as Best Buy ) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again .

There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who are n't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV , not a single one , that my wife and I do n't flock to week to week , other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception . As the 3rd season played out , we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season , all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger . A serial rapist . A murder on campus . All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then , when the show started back up , all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes . The following episodes were , for lack of better words , UNEVENTFUL . All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending . What did they do ? What happened ? Did the writers lose interest ? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes ? This is what I think . Personally , I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them . So , they in turn , gave up on the CW.All speculation aside , VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season . The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact , but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it 's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts . The ratings that they 're suffering are n't because of quality of show , but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies ... like the big boys do ... cause we 're watching ... and unfortunately , we 're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore ."}, "24230": {"id": "24229", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Wait , Veronica is a freshman at imaginary U !

Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive , but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience . Instead of writing something that he could be proud of , he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted . In many ways , the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue . In the third season of Veronica Mars , Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one-off episodes that did n't tie into the arcs . Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans , Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school . The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be . Buffy recovered from the same setback , but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate & # 34 ; LOVE ME & # 34 ; vibe that wrecked the last season . A little fan service is nice . It 's cool to see Mac and Wallace again . Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine . It 's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children 's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet , a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating . Do we really need to get Piz again ? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores . Does Madison have to be a one-dimensional villain ten years later ? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law . Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2 . The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1 . When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead classmates , you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service , the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story . It 's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get . Unfortunately , as you are referring to the Wiki , you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery - which should already be obvious since it follows the & # 34 ; really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role & # 34 ; pattern.This is n't a bad movie .

Hangers on include her younger sister who lives with her and knows nothing of her secret life , and later , a boyfriend . And for character development , well , in 8 episodes , that 's all we have time for , folks . Think of it as Alias , with added bionics , minus any of the charisma.Acting is fine - Michelle Ryan hits the required notes of all American woman , and woman who you believe can throw a punch , but somehow never quite convinces of having the superior IQ of the character - again , mostly the writing and not her fault . Miguel Ferrer is the boss , to add Hollywood clout . Let 's face it though , If Miguel Ferrer is who you turn to to add clout.. well . Need I say more . One of the highlights is a story arc with Isaiah Washington who turns out to be the most believable character in the series , and a delicious cameo over several episodes with Katee Sackhoff , from Battlestar Galactica . Since the producer of this series also brought that series to the screen , it is especially disappointing that it is on story and writing that this series stumbles.So we have a fairly hum drum series which relies completely on its high concept , and lacks pazazz .

It is sad to see the hottest show of 2006 go down in flames in 2007 ."}, "24284": {"id": "24283", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "First off , I 've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades , and they 've all had some things in common , and they 've all had some differences . Most of them steal from the original ( Bram Stoker ) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources ( such as Anne Rice ) because vampire canon , such as it is , was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice . I loved , loved , LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer ( the TV show , not the movie ) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show , as was its spin-off Angel.That said , I disagree with most reviewers who 've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel . It is not . The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires , not the pantheon of assorted trolls , demons , and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated . Also , the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight , the short-lived ( 3 seasons ) CBS `` Crime Time After Prime Time '' early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto . Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight , in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the `` monster '' he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development , plot devices , and historical flashbacks/backstory . Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman , with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger , death , or some other terrible outcome ( the human being `` turned '' vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath ) ; thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other 's lives ( plot device ) , and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same , er , species ( living or undead ) ( also plot devices ) . And , like Nick Knight , Mick St. John prefers not to drink ( eat ) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood , Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood . Moonlight , in those respects , is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight . ( After this point , there are SPOILERS , so you may want to stop reading now ... ) However , there are some clever differences : Forever Knight 's big , bad sire vampire LaCroix , who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his `` gift '' of eternal life ( and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship ) has been replaced by Coraline . Coraline is Mick St. John 's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who 'd lived some 500 years , sired Mick ( made him a vampire ) on their wedding night ( in 1952 ) , and enmeshed him in an obsessive , addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually could n't . He never wanted to be a vampire -- he did n't even know she was one when they married . She made him a vampire against his will , without asking him or getting his permission . Now , of course , he has `` trust issues . '' She , from her perspective , gave him a `` gift '' of eternal life -- freedom from death ( sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight ! ) .Coraline crossed a fatal line , however , when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little `` family '' ( sounds familiar , eh ? rather like Lestat , Louis , and Claudia in Anne Rice 's Interview With The Vampire ) . Mick , by this time ( 1982 ) , was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective ( it is implied , though not directly stated , that he `` does good '' as a PI because he feels guilty about the `` bad '' he 's done as a vampire ) . It was in this capacity that the girl 's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes do n't kill vampires , they just paralyze them . Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe . Mick , in his PI role in the first episode , finds the distraught mother 's little girl , rescues her , stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her , and sets the place on fire before locking her in . The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family . Thus begins Mick 's distant `` relationship '' with Beth Turner , who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire , a mostly online magazine that 's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox 's character Lucy edits on FX 's show Dirt , except it 's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism . Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight , `` No Such Thing as Vampires , '' Beth , now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions ( but news-whore tendencies ) , winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers . Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA ( with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef , a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring , formerly on Veronica Mars ) .I did n't watch this episode on CBS . In fact , I did n't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS ' web site of full video , Innertube . I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin 's eye-candy good looks , I 've always loved the vampire genre , and I dearly loved Jason Dohring 's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars , so I knew I wanted to catch the show . But I was n't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing . The first episode was as predicted : stilted dialogue , cliche-ish plot devices , utterly predictable plot and twists.However , what keeps me watching the show are several things : ( 1 ) the show has a beautiful , SoCal corrupt clarity about it , a noir look that is dark , decadent , sexy , and shiny ; ( 2 ) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he 's on it because he 's got screen presence and , despite the poor material , seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills , including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language , which communicate volumes ; ( 3 ) Jason Dohring , who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen , and plays his amoral , jaded vampire role to the hilt , practically eating up the scenery , and ( 4 ) Sophia Myles , who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight ( in the first Underworld movie ) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion , and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin . She also is n't your typical stick-thin , anorexic-looking TV actress ; the girl 's got a little meat on her bones . So , unlike many of the women on TV , she actually occasionally looks like a `` real '' woman . Finally , ( 5 ) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it 's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode , however , was straight out of B-movie ( or is that B-TV ) hell . I thought , `` Eh , that was was pretty ; I 'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better . '' I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back , too . But I was n't expecting much from the show based on the first episode . I figured it would be my guilty pleasure , something I 'd watch as `` webisodes '' and not much else.Surprisingly , it 's getting really good . This has a lot to do with improved writing , developing backstory , intersecting relationship triangles , and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick 's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline . It 's still eye candy , but I do n't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV . I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox . I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this . But the most recent episodes ( we 're up to episode 9 now ) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick , while also increasing the tension between Mick 's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef ( Jason Dohring ) and the unhappy , secretly self-hating Mick , who longs for a cure for his vampirism , some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline ( Shannyn Sossamon ) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick `` went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster '' has only improved the show 's `` grab '' factor . The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn , but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon . And there 's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well . There are some very sexy ( though still network-TV-permissible ) scenes on later eps and I 'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake : like Angel , Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them , as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight , and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires . It 's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human , and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two ( or three or four ) evils , or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making . They 're still vampire shows , and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not `` serious '' literature . But as Battlestar Galactica fans know , it 's not the genre that defines the shows , it 's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they 're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective , this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all , and neither is the second . But the show is coming along , it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode , `` No Such Thing As Vampires , '' and the second Moonlight episode , as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following ( more entertaining and less contrived ) episodes ."}, "24285": {"id": "24284", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "While the first two seasons were very successful , the third season is awful .

It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there . The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout . The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed , characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense . Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over-acting the norm and erratic -- unbalanced ? -- behavior expected . I would n't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer , much less command a ship . His always-to-excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command , a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin . While a better leader than Bill Adama , she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust . So , too , was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff . Ultimately , I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care . And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately did n't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons . The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration . I said in another review of the series -- season 3 ? -- that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away . Ultimately , I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall , I liked the Cylons more than the humans . I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable . It sadly just was n't executed well . When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode-to-episode , you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet -- I even hope -- that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades .

Let 's see ... strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers , zombies being sexy , having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor ... ever , the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund , special effects you 'd find in Xena : Warrior Princess , a Christian stripping for her nanna , Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her ... well ... I 'll let you see that for yourself , angry dragons , and foamy chewbaccas ... the list goes on and on . I 'm sure I missed so many more . The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is , there 's still a few good things buried under the cheese . It 's kind of like an enchilada made with cheap cheese . All the cheap stuff is on the outside , but there 's some good stuff on the inside . The most obvious being that there 's a lot of nudity in this , which is good because it 'll probably be one of the only things that 'll keep anyone watching . Robert Englund 's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable . Also , the make-up effects are surprisingly good at times . The special effects are horrid , but the make-up is actually better than you think it 'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this , I ca n't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark . The thing is though if you stick with it , it 's actually enjoyable because it 's so bad . It 's cheesy , it 's amusing , the acting is so bad that you 'll be quoting it for days , the plot is pointless , and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending ! My point is that it 's a bad film and I 'm not defending it , but if you manage to sit through the whole thing ... you may find yourself enjoying parts of it like I did.Rating : 4/10 ( most people will probably rate it a 1/10 ... if that )"}, "24300": {"id": "24299", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Jenna Jameson has no looks left and has n't for years , and ca n't spell the word `` act '' much less do any of it , and it shows beyond doubt in this movie made for teenage boys .

Caesar Chavez ... Cinco de Mayo ... guacamole ... '' .Yeah , funny , funny stuff , right ? Mr.Englund does a fine job as the owner of the strip club , who is deathly afraid of catching `` something '' off of one of his girls and just loves his money.The strippers themselves I thought also did a pretty good job but the `` comic relief '' , such as it is , comes in the form of the opening act , the hippest but dumbest and street wise bunch of Marines you have ever seen.None of them had the acting chops to pull off a send up like theirs , even if they had tried ... oh yeah , they were trying.Sorry guys.The plot finds a laboratory become infested with zombies.The marines are called in to eradicate them.They do their job , but in the process one gets bitten and flees the building through a basement window ( great security ) .That Marine in turn heads into a nearby strip club and infects one of the dancers.That dancer/stripper infects another dancer/stripper , and so on and so on.Before you know it the ones uninfected WANT to become infected , as the infected ones are getting all the attention from the male patrons.And oh yes , the strippers , after their dances , each take a patron into the back and proceed to eat them.The remains , either heads , bodies without heads , bodies with heads , etc. , usually re-animate and they lock them in jail-like cells in the basement.Does n't every strip club you know have jail cells ? Owner Englund at first is beside himself with what is happening , but before you can say `` bite me '' , he sees dollar signs.The strippers are soon competing with one another and Englund is raking in the dough.Somewhere along the line , the Marine major/leader finds out about the zombies at the club ( he overhears a convo while reading a newspaper outside ! ) .Meanwhile one of the stripper zombies has gone down into the basement and voluntarily let the incarcerated ones bite and infect her.She also lets all of them out and they go a-wandering around the club.The Marines come to the rescue and exterminate the zombie menace.Poor Englund gets bitten and is to be taken back to the labs for testing.The Marines also find one of the lab personel in the club trying to pick a lock ( ? ) .He fesses that it was he who deliberately spread the zombie virus throughout the lab.He said there 's alot of money to be had in `` working for the man '' .The Marines leave going to do ... whatever they usually do , and the lab man has two of his unbitten cohorts come in to clean up the strip club mess.For a low budget film , the special effects ( heads being blown off , ripped apart , etc . ) are on the whole not too shabby , as opposed to those in Alien Armegeddon , another indie cheapie.The demographic for a film like this would be male,18-25 yrs. , because there is ALOT of T & A ; throughout the film , graphic at that ( I think they called it nudity , once upon a time ) .It is this group that would probably love this film , for that alone.Males of ages before , should n't be viewing this at all and those after , will , for the most part , see the film for what it is ... .bad.The only other person to stand out to any extent was Carmit Levit & eacute ; as the Russian Blavatski , who was directly in charge of the dancers.At first I thought her portrayal was a bit over the top , but as the movie progressed she seem to settle down and I actually did n't mind her performance at all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes , deleted scenes & commentary.All in all , despite having star Robert Englund on board for this project , it is an amateurish and lame excuse for a film and it 's satire , send ups and laughs fall flat.Mr.Englund does a good job , as do the strippers ( for the most part ) and their handler Levite ' , but it is not nearly enough to save this dud.Give it a wide pass ."}, "24303": {"id": "24302", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Rented on whim .

Unfortunately we need someone who can turn absurdity into comedy here . `` Zombie Strippers '' suffers slack direction , especially its earlier part where Robert Englund does not appear . Clearly Robert Englund is having a good time , and watching him as the sleazy ( and cowardly ) owner is fun , but the film is only sporadically funny with too scanty supply of jokes or ideas . `` Zombie Strippers '' is a comedy in which Robert Englund 's club owner is named `` Ian Essko '' and his club `` Rhino .

I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with , but I will suffice with a complaint list.1 . The plethora of plot twists . Even M. Night Shayamalan would 've said enough 's enough.2 . Bringing people back to life . I know that they were never confirmed dead , but they were dead enough . I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.3 . The various coalitions . How many bad guys can you work with just because `` you need them. '' 4 . The sloppiness of The Company . Whereas the General would n't even say a word in season 2 , by season 4 he was a chatty kathy . He was equally careless with who he killed and how.5 . The slipperiness of T-Bag . T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing : if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag . He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.6 . The Scofield boyscout act . In season 1 and 2 Scofield 's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality . It made you realize that he was no real criminal , he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother . By season 4 I was sick of the `` I wo n't kill '' act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger . Ultimately , that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people ( i.e . the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull ) . The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger ... surprise the gun was n't loaded . Heck , Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.7 . The resilient bodies . I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast . I do n't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking , but as in their abilities to heal so quickly . Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes to suspended belief : manhole covers that weigh five pounds , concrete that easily crumbles , abilities to run long distances at top speed , etc . But , I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified . From the beatings , stabbings , shootings and other abuse Scofield , Burrows , T-Bag , Bellick and Sucre took , they should still be hospitalized . Scofield did n't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed . Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.8 . My indifference . In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat . I was holding my breath with every close call . I was exhaling with every escape . I was enthralled by Scofield 's detailed planning . I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair . All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4 . I was no longer at the edge of my seat , I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph . And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4 . Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.The show lost its umph and lost its luster . There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality . It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing . As the writing got sloppier , so did Scofield and The Company . It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did . Even the ending was anti-climactic .

What the producers and writers consistently fail to understand is that the fans of the show enjoy seeing the heroes work together , and not in the same predictable pairings ( Ando & Hiro , Peter & Nathan , etc. ) . By the end of the season , I really had no idea what the main plotline was and why I should care about any of it . `` Heroes '' started as a fresh , clever series filled with interesting characters , and the producers showed a willingness to add new characters to help prevent things from getting stale . Unfortunately , the producers and writers really lost the thread by the third season , stubbornly sticking with the same cast of heroes , long past their expiration date . Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian ; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak . Instead of introducing new heroes , each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored . One week Noah and Sylar are working together , then they 're enemies ; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited , then they 're enemies ; shampoo , rinse , and repeat . Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome .

A mentalist , he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading , hypnotism and other mental games . The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience , while still very enthusiastic , is aging and dwindling . In his heyday , he appeared on `` The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson '' sixty three times , a fact he mentions repeatedly , and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard , a title he has determinedly kept ever since . Preparing for his big comeback , his business manager ( Ricky Jay ) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager . Troy Gable ( Colin Hanks , son of Tom ) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer . But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills , so he interviews to work with Buck . He gets the job and heads out with the performer , making sure Buck 's every request is filled , that the venues have everything set up , stagehands are ready to go , and the like . The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such . Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new `` The Tonight Show '' and plans a big stunt , guaranteed to kick-start his comeback . He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist . Valerie Brennan ( Emily Blunt , `` Sunshine Cleaning '' , `` The Devil Wears Prada '' ) shows up and begins to set everything in place . But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly , `` The Great Buck Howard '' misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable . It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self-perceived fame and glory . Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts , `` I love this town , '' and he really seems to mean it . He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience . But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show . Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we ca n't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny . We have seen this type of character before . Many times . And many of these performances have been more insightful , more daring and more interesting.For `` Buck Howard '' to work , we need to realize the character knows his career is fading . He does n't seem to . He enjoys the shows so much , you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun . In fact , much of the time , he seems to be trying to make Troy 's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great ' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self-aware . If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing , are we supposed to either laugh at or with , or feel empathy towards him ? He is n't desperate enough and enjoys what he does , even on a smaller scale , too much.Colin Hanks is OK , but he spends most of the time standing to one side , observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression . The only clues we seem to get come from his narration . And his narration never seems to stop , rambling on and on . Film is a visual medium , a visual art form , so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading . Narration is useful and necessary in some instances . It is n't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen , when we ca n't tell this visually . At least it should n't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film , both bad . In `` Vicky Cristina Barcelona '' , Woody Allen uses an omniscient ( and ever present ) narrator to tell us the feelings , thoughts , likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen . It quickly grates on the viewer 's nerves . Worse , the narrator is n't even a character in the story . It 's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes . The narration in `` Buck Howard '' seems designed for a different purpose . In many low budget , independent films , a narrator provides a useful tool . They tell us about things , bridging the gap in the stories , saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed . I generally overlook this , because it is n't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film . In `` Buck Howard '' , I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons , to help show things they could n't afford to film , but Hank 's descriptions go beyond this . They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling , thinking , want to do and accomplish . Why are n't we seeing this in the characters themselves ? Why do we have to be told this ? Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film . He stands to the side a lot , observing , watching , rarely speaking . When he does , he always seems kind of flat , as though he ca n't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions . I ca n't help but think how much different his father 's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt 's Valeria shows up , Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship . Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air . Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation . From New York , it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world . She moves faster , registers faster , reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town . As soon as she meets Troy , she begins to flirt with him ( she must see something we do n't ) and he picks up on it , relishing the new relationship . At one point , Valerie ca n't help but laugh at one of Buck 's statements , providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck 's official hosts in Cincinnati . It is an amusing idea , but the roles do n't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei ( Mr. Sulu on `` Star Trek ) . But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat . It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect `` The Great Buck Howard '' will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity , much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy ."}, "24356": {"id": "24355", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "You 'll hear the phrase `` Total Package '' so many times that you 'll become immune to it . The fact that it 's being used in relation to a child does n't seem to bother either the parents or the pageant coordinators.From the get go , it 's obvious to everyone but the parents that the pageants are a scam . Everyone `` wins '' or `` places . '' The crowning system is some bizarre set of rules where no one really goes home a loser but where the `` Queen '' of each `` division '' is also not a winner . There 's a set of `` supreme '' crowns and a grouping of `` Ultimate '' crowns which is the `` winner '' of the entire pageant . Oh , whatever . It sounds like a set of prizes a couple of five year olds made up.You ca n't really compete in a full `` Glitz '' pageant unless you have a `` cupcake '' dress , the proper hair pieces , full make up , a fake spray on tan , glamour and retouched photos and other accouterments but your total prize will more than likely be only $ 1000 .

Unfortunately , the episode titled `` Pinewood Derby '' simply did n't allow for that re-ignition of my liking and I 'm sad to say I will not be jumping to the chance to watch the other season 13 episodes.The story focuses around what many South Park fans are constantly asking for ; an episode that has Randy Marsh as the main protagonist . This episode focuses around Randy 's passion for Stan to win the Pinewood Derby which they have yet to do in all the years it 's run . In order to win , Randy steals a magnetic piece of the CERN super collider and conceals it in the car . They win the race and inadvertently discover warp speed which is picked up on by an alien criminal who holds earth hostage while Randy struggles to keep his secret while building a new car.I suppose a lot of what let this episode down was the absence of the other 3 boys . I have never really been a fan of the Randy Marsh character . He 's good for a part in an episode , but it 's been proven in the past that an episode focusing almost entirely on him simply does n't work . The episode seems to fall flat in a number of ways .

It is an Independent film shot on a very small budget , the characters are ultra quirky marginals , and there 's a sense of wonder if the two will actually get together or not , and what is really wrong with the 'woman ' , why ca n't she be in love ? But then the whole thing has this strange porn thread that runs throughout the film . And the ending is just plain flat out painful with Tom Arnold as the creep out father of the century . Tom Arnold has now hit a home run in the creep category.The director , writer , and lead female is Marianna Palka . Jason Ritter ( John Ritter 's son ) is the lead male actor . The film meanders back and forth between Marianna 's apartment , the video store where Jason works , and Jason 's car where he lives . In the opening montage , Marianna walks into the video store and goes sheepishly over to the erotica film section . She quickly chooses four movies . Jason tries to convince her that one choice was a bad one , and she should not take that movie . He leaves off renting her the fourth movie , she leaves with the three films . Jason then stalks her at her apartment building.The film is claustraphobic , the apartment is small , Jason over stays his welcome , the two end up just too close to eachother , the car where he sleeps is tiny . The only place that is somewhat open is the video store . Both of these characters have strange habits . She wears baggies over her hands to open the DVD 's , she hates to have her hair washed , she collects trash in her apartment , and likes to act out forcing herself on Jason . Jason likes to tell people what movies to watch , he has a regular job but ca n't afford a place to live , he is creepy about peeking through windows and shower curtains , and following Marianna around.I had a very hard time believing these two characters . It was as if the director / screen writer was trying so hard to make them both seem strange , like outcasts , outsiders ; but yet they were both somehow brilliant and deeply misunderstood . And then there was this annoying constant reference to pornography and Marianna 's distaste for genitals , male and female . The fact that the two of them are attracted to eachother , well that was reasonable.Technically , there were some problems . The audio was absolutely awful , the music was way overboosted and the dialog was poorly recorded . This is a film that relys heavily on dialog to build the craziness of the two characters , sadly the dialog was frequently muddy . This was a simple shoot , very few locations or sets ; the video store , the car , the apartment complex entrance , and the apartment . The director did not use framing to her advantage at all , Marianne changes fairly dramatically in this story ; but yet she ends up in random frame positions . There were many jump cuts that were too abrupt . Moments where incredible detail and slow paced filming , butted up against a jump cut to a much later time . The film had a hard time developing a decent rhythm . One moment the camera is in the apartment , the next in Jason 's car the next morning.The DVD includes a few trailers , oddly Confessions of a Porn Addict trailer is included . A gag reel that has the poorest sound recording I 've ever heard . This is a not so funny 10 minute reel.At One hour and 25 minutes , the movie is a bit long . The ending beats a dead horse a bit too hard . The film is definately R rated and not at all for younger viewers . Oddly , there is virtually no nudity in the film . Everything that makes this film R is verbal.It just seemed to me that Marianna Palka tried to do too much with this film ; write , direct , star in , and over play a not so bad love story .

They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons ( which , albeit they may not bother many other people , enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series ) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid .

And do n't get me started on the collagenized lips . ) And because Lightman is the only person with brains , the writers had to invent juvenile stuff for the other characters to do ( i.e . almost kissing , nearly kissing , finally kissing ) which did n't require any . Bo-ring.The other glaring problem is that by the second half of Season Two , it becomes manifestly clear that the writers have no idea what they are doing . First , Lightman has to pay off his ex-wife in order to keep her from taking their daughter to another state . ( That NEVER happens in real life . With joint custody , neither parent can move the child out of state . Did n't these people watch Boston Legal ? ) Having paid off his wife , his business is about to collapse . ( What is his business anyway ? Why does he need all those people ? And if all he has to do is stare at a person to figure out what they 're thinking , why does he need all that equipment ? ) So , he gets involved with Clara , who has scads of money but is dumb as a post . ( They eventually get rid of Clara because she really , really ca n't act . She just has these enormous LIPS , which they figured would distract the audience from the fact that there was NO PLOT . ) Then , Lightman does something stupid with some Peruvians ( who were n't from Peru , by the way . They were home-grown Latinos . You could tell by the accents , and the fact that the Sendero Luminoso has been defunct for about 30 years , give or take a decade . ) Now Lightman 's afraid of losing custody of his daughter ( When did he get custody ? I thought his ex had custody ) . So the FBI agent who hangs around the Lightman Group ( doing what exactly ? ) breaks the law not just once , but several times , so Lightman can keep his daughter . ( Although , frankly , I 'd give her up . She 's an airhead , and that `` deer caught in headlights '' look wears thin after awhile . And why is she ALWAYS hanging around her father 's office ? Does n't she go to school ? ) But the agent does n't get fired , because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer , withholding evidence , obstructing justice ... you know , all those little things you 'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies , logic errors and contrivances , the plots got increasingly incoherent , until NOBODY could follow what was going on . Not even the Harvard grad who came up with the idea for the show in the first place . Even if you think you know what the stories are about , you really do n't , because nothing the characters do makes any sense ... not in this world or the next . ( Why get yourself admitted to a mental hospital to have a two-minute conversation with someone . Why not just go and talk to her ? ) And when you have n't got a decent story , the obvious thing to do is to keep transmogrifying your main character ( all you Buffy fans know what that word means ) . Now he 's a psychologist , now he 's a former criminal , now he 's Rambo , now he 's a gambling addict , now he 's an overprotective father , now he 's sleeping with that awful Clara with the LIPS god help me ... and then add enough bombs , terrorists , and psychokillers until , you hope , the audience will have completely lost sight of whatever it was the writers thought they were doing when they should have been WRITING.I have to stop , because the more I think about this show the worse it gets . . . and I really like Tim Roth .

I fondly remember seeing the original movie at the theater and was immediately impressed by its imagination . As it evolved into a weekly series I watched as my sons grew and became enthralled in the story line with me . And yes , we even liked `` Atlantis '' .The Syfy channel promoted this show as an `` edgier '' Stargate . I found that this did not work for me . The very elements that made the original movie and following 15 seasons so enjoyable was now totally lost in this self-inflicted reinvention . Stories that were once fun , adventurous , full of camaraderie & humor were now jettisoned in favor of a grittier , darker , gloomier , smuttier and meandering approach.Some shows can evolve successfully . What we had here was the results of a very bad miss-calculation by MGM Television in canceling `` Atlantis '' . And then upon realizing their mistake the panic-ridden response to rectify this error by delivering back unto us a forced-format that was now supposed to be better because now it was `` edgier '' . `` Edgy '' can be a dangerous creative mixture with a show like Stargate . `` Edgy '' can mean daring , provocative , and/or avant-garde . But the nasty flip-side is that it can just as quickly turn into something unusual and unpleasant . And much of this `` Universe '' seemed forced and uncomfortable.Example : One early entry went something like this . `` OK , we have a room on board the Destiny that we are only now able to open and explore '' ... `` Oh look , its one of those Ancient 's Chairs , I wonder where this will lead ? '' We quickly find that it leads to an hour with an angry lesbian , a fist fight over infidelity , and `` Oh snot , my girlfriend is a stripper '' .As the second-season cancellation decisively proved , this new and `` improved '' model was not the way to have gone . Yes , this was not `` your grandfather 's Stargate '' but as it turned out it was n't my teenage sons Stargate either . Those of us who wanted `` edgy '' adult science fiction got it from `` Battlestar Galactica '' . Sometimes it is possible to `` break the mold '' and I feel this is exactly what MGM accomplished by hastily forcing this blend of science fiction together.And that 's a shame . First off , because the 15 seasons of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis were unique , interesting and fun . It should never have ended so suddenly . Lastly , the second season of `` Universe '' seemed to start finding itself and showed some promise . It was just unfortunate that it could n't survive the errors of the first season.I would have even accepted a couple stand-alone movies like `` Ark of the Truth '' and `` Continuum '' to have dealt with the season two cliff-hanger properly winding the show up . Though promised , I fear we will never see these . In a dorky way it would be cool to find a 10th Chevron that dialed the show back onto the airwaves.Note : You are right if you noticed that I did buy a copy of this DVD by `` Amazon 's Verified Purchase '' notation . I confess .

They are much brighter than OEM and other replacement bulbs as my previous review states on the other vehicles I have used these with . HOWEVER the DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS NO LONGER FUNCTION by automatically turning on the low beam headlights when the car is turned on . To me this is not a problem , if one wants to drive during the day with their headlights on they can do so by simply turning them on manually . Just note that this may occur if you car is equipped with daytime running lamps . Personally I prefer them as is and like the complete control of when my headlights are on or off and think exchanging FAR brighter bulbs for them being on automatically during the day is more than worth it , and again the price here on Amazon was much cheaper than in the stores , still think these are the best halogen bulb replacement deal out there . Fast and easy way to make your headlights brighter . **Yes these bulbs are about as good as you are going to get with your stock headlights , they have a noticeable improvement in brightness over the stock bulbs , but do n't expect too much . These bulbs have made the biggest improvement over stock among the various similar bulbs of which I have tried . I like them a bit better than the Silver Stars for example . The price here was very good and they basically did about what they were advertised to do . I would recommend them . However these or any other bulbs may not be enough if you have other issues such as the clouded headlight lenses . These are good halogen bulb replacements , they will be brighter than stock but not without clear lenses and not turn them in to HID brightness levels . If you have old clouded lenses as well then using a headlight restoration kit will help a lot as well . I used these bulbs along with one of the Maguires headlight restoration kit with the Plastic X compound . My mothers 98 Toyota Camry had very weak headlights and I noticed the clouded lenses and purchased these bulbs to try to give her the best vision for night driving I could . Especially important if one does not have the best night vision to begin with . So that gave her clear lenses again which was needed for any new bulb to work better . This is about as good as one is going to get with a halogen bulb upgrade from all of those I have tried to date and they are very easy to install . So a good improvement for the money as they are easy to change and inexpensive.It is easy to see the difference in brightness with these bulbs . Just change one out and turn your headlight on shining on your garage door for example . It should be obvious they are both brighter and whiter . The easiest and cheapest way to make your stock headlights brighter . While I keep the bulbs I have replaced in the vehicle just in case one is needed in an emergency I have yet to have one of these bulbs burn out prematurely . I have had them in one vehicle for 2 years and still working . For about 25 bucks they are both a good deal and better than found at the local parts stores.If they are not bright enough for you just do not make the mistake of going to a plug and play type HID kit ... See Below about that.The only real way to get an incredible improvement ( 3-4 times brighter ) from your stock headlight housings is to do a PROPER HID retrofit . But as for HID I want to make it clear that they are great and will be about 3- 4 times brighter than stock for sure and use less wattage as almost all run at 35 watts . BEWARE if you are going to go with HID 's one should NOT buy an inexpensive `` Plug and Play '' kit that uses ballasts and HID bulbs that you stick in your stock halogen headlight housing . Doing so will cause the huge increase in brightness with no control of the beam pattern and while also illegal almost everywhere more importantly they will blind oncoming traffic and are a hazard will likely burn your reflectors in your headlight housings and are just a horrible thing to do period , no exceptions . HOWEVER there is a CORRECT way to upgrade to HID headlights which is known as `` retrofitting '' which means that you install projectors designed for HID bulbs . This is a great improvement and they have cutoff shields built in to the projectors so there is a very controlled but wide and bright low beam and super good high beam output . Doing this requires opening up the actual headlight housing and installing the new projectors and mounting the ballasts and new wiring harness . There is a place that sells these sort of kits for retrofitting and web sites dedicated to this subject . It is far from just plugging in a new bulb such as this so it takes a bit of effort or paying a shop that does HID retrofits to do this for you . Just a warning to those that think the cheap HID kits everywhere are not an option to even consider . Get the best halogen bulbs you can find or do a full HID retrofit . Do n't make the mistake that just using a HID plug and play kit such as is commonly sold here and other places is a `` middle of the road option '' . It is most likely illegal and never a good idea no matter how enticing the cheap prices seem.Use these halogen upgrade bulbs and if that is not enough for you then go all the way . There are just way too many that go for these plug and play kits that are illegal and cause accidents that I want the message out that they should not be considered which many that are looking for brighter headlights such as those purchasing these bulbs could potentially consider . If interested in HID try a web site forum like the HID planet for advice ."}, "24465": {"id": "24464", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Nice white light , a little brighter than a `` regular '' bulb .

You only need to unscrew the 2 innermost screws on the driver break light ( the outside 2 just hold the light cover on ) . Then just wiggle it a bit and it will pop off .

I ordered it and 18 hours later it was on my doorstep . From there I made some custom screnes which the free version is not more than a demo - I bought the 4.95 torque pro and behold 100+ obd2 items and tons of display formats in 5 sizes on 11 screens were customizable in front of me.I run a droid bionic stock in a lapdock display screen - as soon as the 327 was in my honda pilot it figured it out without any work from me . I had to enter my engine displacement and drive over a scale at a truckstop I know to weigh the vehicle but from there I get 11 pages of digital numeric data , graphs over time , dial gages with bugs ( those low / high tabs that stick to the range you run through ) along with the vocal anouncement of when your engine is up to temperature and ready to perform and any alarms that come up.Today I moved my 16 mpg to 45 mpg avg just by using a screen with average and instantaneous mileage side by side with engine load . It turned out running the a/c at a stop sign really uses more gas from the short term fuel trim levels and the engine load demand graph going from 30 at idle to 42 with the ac on , fans on at the radiator , and fans on front/rear seats . It is so precise you can see the impact of running the headlights as alternator load on the engine.The numeric data is accurate to 1 unit ( e.g . 1 percent load on 0-100 % or 1 rpm in 0-6500 rpm ) - it even showed the extra fuel used to heat the seat . OBDII even gives you the available fuel in the tank digitally - I discovered it holds back 10 % in case you need to limp home . RPM ( tach ) is both analog dial and digital numerics with the number ( e.g . 741 rpm ) in the center of the dial . You can check speed from gps or from obd2 and check for errors in your speedo due to tire size etc . It also makes good use of the droid x , y , z g force meters and once programmed for your vehicle ( you can setup many vehicles and move the BT adapter ) it will time your 0-60 ( be sure to change to english units as the author appears to come from a metric country ) - also change gallons to us imperial gallons.Many of the dials are calculated in the droid or taken from the sensors and gps . I am running a stock bionic dual proc 1 ghz phone with ample computational power . It has a logging function and will save every 1 , 3 , or 5 seconds to an xls or csv file.A friend dropped by last night before smog checking his 2000 yukon - we found 4 error codes and fixed the problems then oblitterated all signs the codes were ever in the ecu - passed smog the today ( in CALIFORNIA ! ) like a charm.Basically the 5 buck s/w and 15 buck h/w gives you a sun diag tool complete with code lookup tables so you know where to check for faults ( o2 sensor , fuel injector , fuel rail pressure , etc ) With 11 screens you can develop a mileage screen , troubleshooting display , default 6 dial display that comes on the center page . Using the HDMI output to a large monitor you can use the tiny displays ( pro comes with 5 sizes of display ) and they are 100 % readable . other pages will show barometric pressure , coolant temp , battery voltage , and it even works with the key in and the engine stoppedSo if you are droid based a jackson sets you up with a full sun auto analyzer that even can upload data logs and make phone calls . I 'm still reading into the program but it appears it will show you your path on a map and overlay the places you floored the pedal to cross 4 lanes of traffic .I also used it in a 1995 gm 5.7 L V8 TBI which was OBD 1.5 - some sensors were marked out , but open loop closed loop smog was there , as was the codes stored and their meaning ( the engine runs 3 secs then stops ) . So in 3 days I used it in 3 cars with utter amazement . I 'll buy my mechanic a droid and one of these just so he can maintain the fleet vehicles with ease and save 480 bucks off a sun engine analyzer . It even shows timing advance/retard during shifts and short term fuel trim/long term fuel trim - a serious diagnostic tool for most 1995-1996 and later vehicles . I 'm dying to try it on a prius.I 'm very happy the auto makers standardized on obd2 pretty much across the board from honda , gm , ford , am general , etc .

They are very high quality and should work fine to correct fast blinking light issues for normal cars.In my case I bought them for correcting fast blinking light issue on my Lotus Evora that happens after doing the popular DRL-disable hack , which involves disconnecting the main headlights from a relay circuit that controls the brake lights . The ECU is programmed to expect a certain load on the brake light circuit to determine whether or not the brake lights are out . This value includes a default load of used by the DRLs . By turning off disconnecting the DRLs from the brakelight circuit , the baseline has lowered and therefore the ECU thinks one of the bulbs ( front or rear ) have failed ( when they are actually not ) and increases the turn signal blink rate . ( The Evora has no independent turn signal lights , it uses the brake lights ) .Anyway , the fix is to mock the original load , thereby correcting the current levels back within the expected threshold.While these resistors will work in eliminating the fast blinking , the draw far too much amps than actually needed . Also , at drawing 2 amps of current they generate an amazing amount of heat , which would be okay on most cars with metal body work , but for the Evora , the delicate composite body and trim panels surrounding the heat sink can potentially warp under prolonged heating . Also , because the DRL circuit leaves the lights on while engine is not running , more battery power will be used up than before . Lastly the excessive 2A load would negate the car 's ability to actually detect a real bulb failure in the event it really happens.All that is needed is to simulate the original 3W bulb load at each brake light using a pair of 30 ohm 5W resistors . Each of those will only draw a miniscule 250mA.Anyway , I hope this helps ."}, "24643": {"id": "24642", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I needed a little charger to maintain a motorcycle battery and this one works great .

But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try . One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed , shiny , and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before . It also does not cling to plastic , windows or rubber everything it touches it comes off of leaving a high shine on it , So I used it on everything.NOW THIS IS MY REVISED REVIEW AS OF AUGUST 2013 . AFTER USING THIS AND LIKING IT AT 1ST ... I FOUND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BEAD BUT WATER STREAKS SEEM TO STICK AND STAY ON WAXED SURFACE ON FIBERGLASS EVEN WASHING WONT REMOVE THEM EASY . SO I WENT BACK TO USING PROTECT-ALL ON MY RV . IT SHINES AS WELL BUT ALSO THE WATER STREAKS ARE MINIMAL AFTER A RAIN AND WASH OFF EASIER.I also find the protect-all brand wax to last long and come off cleaner after applying wax leaving a cleaner shine.Making it far easier to do a big RV in less time then Flagship wax . I FOUND fLAGSHIP TO BE CAKY THICK AND HARDER TO REMOVE AND HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GET FRESH RAGS TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET OFF ... ... ...

I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say , I was rather disappointed . The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED . In the daylight , the light output from the flare is barely noticeable . At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention . Or , if you were using it on a dark trail , it might be visible from a short distance . But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door . The light is also uni-directional ( only coming from one side of the flare ) , so careful positioning would be a must . I think it would be tricky to use as a map light , too , since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said , I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself . It is re-usable , and it could function as a secondary warning marker . It is not flammable , and it came with batteries which seems rare these days . The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good , if most vehicles were made of steel . But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light , it might be acceptable . One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a `` failsafe '' . After all , the more lights the better . However , the idea that it would serve as a `` flare '' is just not correct . If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road , for example , I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights .

In certain limited circumstances , I 'm sure it might be useful . For most circumstances , however , I would only use it as an absolute last resort.The item is made of plastic . Not just any plastic , but appears to be manufactured of the kind of hard plastic that quickly turns very brittle and cracks when exposed to the extreme temperature variations found inside a vehicle , which after all , is where this item is meant to be kept .

Well yes , sort of . The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off , or lights up continuously . The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light , while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists . Unfortunately , the LED is not very bright , and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards , and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed , it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon . While we certainly do n't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers , we also do n't want something so dim that it does n't trigger anyone 's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway ? Forget it , buy some reflective triangles . Rural highways ? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds . Well lit neighborhoods ? It likely wo n't get noticed . From my perspective , about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under , and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides .

Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw 's large diameter head . The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch ( 11 millimeters ) . Option 1 : Replace the nylon retainers on the car , but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a # 12 screw . Option 2 : Try to find # 14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads . I shopped around for # 14 screws with smaller heads to no avail . Option 3 : Grind down the screw head 's diameter . Option 4 ( not good ) : On one car I used # 12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter , but DO fit the rings , and wrapped the threads with tape . This sort of works , but I really ca n't tighten them down satisfactorily . So I have to check their security now and then . I 'm leaving the other car as is for now . Maybe someone has more practical ideas ? Sure would like to hear of them . BTW , SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13 : I think I 've found a viable solution to the above problem . I used a # 12 sheet metal self-tapping screw , placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing ( 1/4 '' i.d . ) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw . Used a heat gun ( or you can use a match , BIC lighter or soldering iron ) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a # 14 screw . This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape . One more thing : The THICKNESS of the screw head does n't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring . The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips `` X '' to use the screwdriver ."}, "24800": {"id": "24799", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I 'm pleased with the appearance of these on my nouveau plate cover , but they feel incredibly cheap and I do n't expect them to stay on while driving down the road .

If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense , let me save you the time -- in my case , the better part of an afternoon.First , a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play : 1 ) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater , 2 ) a secondary plug that screws into the first , and 3 ) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water . I believe the intent of this design is to allow & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve , while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly ( due to the larger diameter ) . Sidenote : opening the actual valve ( the smallest component ) drains the tank very , very slowly , and sometimes only at a trickle if you ca n't get air behind the water -- in my case , I had to open the pressure relief valve ( in addition to all faucets ) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking , the other components did . I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape , and at various depths . No matter what the combination , there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces . There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking . I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape ( 5+ wraps ) , to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering , returned the valve to Amazon , and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug .

My Optima yellow top AGM battery is rated for 15V charging so I thought this charger would be okay for it , but the charger I got puts out 15.5V ! I did find specs that say 15.6V `` regulated voltage '' is okay for `` rapid charging '' on my battery but they do n't define what rapid charging means . They do say with 15.6V to `` charge until current drops below 1 amp '' which I think means you can do 15.6V until the battery gets closer to being charged and stops accepting high amperage . Unfortunately this charger does the exact opposite , starting at lower voltage and increasing to 15.5V around when it decides the battery is at 90 % charge ( which seems to equate to about 12.6 or 12.7V on my battery ) . The charger keeps outputting 15.5V until the battery is fully charged , which may take hours , so it seems unlikely that 's good for most batteries and I 'm pretty sure it 's against the charging specs on my battery . Note that the charger shows 15.4V on its readout but my volt meter shows it 's actually 15.5V.Nevertheless I let it keep doing 15.5V and checked periodically to make sure the battery was n't hot ( it never even felt warm and an IR temperature gun read 86F max ) and was n't hissing ( hissing would mean it was overcharged and releasing gas , permanently reducing its life ) . It took almost exactly 12 hours for the charger to decide it was 100 % charged and go into maintenance mode , but when it did , it picked 12.4V ! AGM batteries are supposed to be charged at around 13.6V for maintenance ( float ) charging , so I have no idea why it picked 12.4V . I left it on for another hour and it actually reduced the voltage to 12.3 , at which point I took it off the charger . Volt meter said the battery was at 12.31V.I ca n't decide if this charger is broken , has a weird charging algorithm , or is actually very smart . I say that because my battery was discharged to about 3.5V a few weeks ago , well below the voltage it 's designed to be discharged to ( it 's a `` deep cycle '' but even deep cycles do n't tolerate discharging below 50 % , and even below 10.5V may hurt them ) , so it 's now damaged and wo n't hold the full 13.6V it 's supposed to . Instead , if I leave it on the charger at 15.5V for an hour , it hits 12.8V and then quickly loses charge to 12.5V in about 30 minutes . So maybe the charger somehow figured that out and decided that 12.4V was `` full charge '' on my damaged battery so that 's what it used as its float charge . I do n't see how it could determine that if the battery was 12.8V or higher after the long 15.5V charge , but who knows.I also do n't know if 15.4V is really bad for my battery , or for the `` average AGM '' . I spent awhile researching but could n't find any real authoritative information , just a bunch of people theorizing . Since it 's above the 15V standard charge on the battery spec sheet I do n't think it 's a good thing , but then again I also found research ( nrel dot gov/vehiclesandfuels/energystorage/pdfs/evs17pres.pdf ) showing that seriously overvolting a yellow top battery to 17V under certain conditions actually increases its life . So I do n't know what to think , but I 'm leaning towards thinking it 's a bad thing to go against the manufacturer 's spec sheet unless you 're in a lab using specialized chargers.What I do know is that the desulfination feature on this charger did n't do a thing for my damaged battery . In fact I do n't think it even kicked in . I connected the charger to a small sealed lead acid battery that I left unused for too long and it went into desulfination mode ( I think - the manual does n't say how you 're supposed to know ) for over 8 hours pumping 16.8V into the battery until it said `` bad bat '' on its screen and stopped charging . In all that time the battery never showed over 15 % charged on the charger , though it did end up holding about 10.9V . In my online research it was mentioned in a few places that there are no studies showing desulfination actually works so I 'm pretty dubious about it . It definitely did n't work on either of my batteries.It was also interesting to note that the sealed lead acid battery never got warm , which I find rather curious considering how long it was putting in such a high voltage . I had the charger connected to a kill-a-watt meter and it showed the charger was pulling only 0.15amps and 9watts , and this is in 2amp charging mode , so maybe the charger is smart enough to use low amperage when it 's using high voltage and that prevents the battery from getting damaged . When it was pushing 15.4V to my AGM battery it was only drawing 0.35amps and it actually reduced the amps to 0.29 as it got closer to 100 % charged . So maybe that protects the battery from overvoltage damage , but I do n't know enough to be sure . Maybe a battery expert will chime in in the comments.Another important thing to consider is that desulfination mode could damage your car 's electronics if you do n't remove the battery from the car to charge it . 16.8V is more than most cars were designed to handle , and I found someone mentioning that BMW warns not to use chargers that do things like that , so it 's definitely a concern . I do n't know if I feel comfortable using this charger again without removing the battery from the car . Some chargers claim to somehow magically detect the presence of car electronics and limit their voltage , but this charger says nothing about that in its manual.Other than all that , the design of the charger is nice . Wires fit into a pocket beneath the retractable handle . It will show you the battery voltage on its readout until you tell it to start charging ( although it reads 0.1 to 0.2V lower than my volt meter , which is annoying ) . A button lets you toggle between display of voltage or battery percent . It lets you choose standard , AGM , and gel cell , and choose from three rates of charge . The slower 2A charge rate is supposed to be better for many batteries , so use 2A or 6A if you are n't in a hurry . I tried both those modes and it still puts out 15.5V in 6A mode but it puts out 15.3V in 2A mode.Since this is a dedicated 12V charger you do n't have to worry about it `` autodetecting '' ( actually , auto-misdetecting ) your discharged 12V battery as a 6V and never charging it past 6V , which is a problem with far too many chargers these days.Despite its nice controls and smart form factor , I give this charger a low rating because I think it tries to push some batteries beyond their limits in the name of charging them as quickly or as fully as possible . One reviewer said it caused his AGM to outgas and another said it burnt out his battery after a few months of trickle charge mode . If you have the right brand of battery that can handle this charger 's output , and your battery is n't damaged , it 's probably fine , but the fact that it can damage things and may even damage car electronics in desulfination mode strikes me as very bad design , especially given that desulfination seems like more of a marketing ploy than a valuable feature . I also do n't like that its volt meter reads 0.1 to 0.2V under actual voltage ."}, "24867": {"id": "24866", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I use this on the back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee .

After doing so , it does make the areas where applied shiny , but the application is uneven , and even then , because it 's a mist , it goes everywhere ( onto the paint , the wheels , etc ) , which is bad . So you end up having to use something like a paper towel or a cloth to spread the product evenly , which ends up removing most of the product ( and making a mess overall ) . Then the shine is gone.This product would be better made as a bottle that is made to apply to a pad or some other applying tool , as the spray is too difficult to control to get it only on the tires.Since evening it out also means removing most of the shine , whatever soaks in leaves a dull but darker look .

I bought two of these , and in about 20 minutes , the problem was solved . They have been installed for about a month , and seem to be working just fine.Installation was easy . The old struts were held by two bolts on each strut . Once they were removed , the new ones popped could be screwed in . You may have to hold the tailgate as far open as possible to install the strut.A couple tips from the installation:1 . Get a helper . Much easier if someone holds up the tailgate while you are trying to replace these.2 . You will need a Torx bit- not sure of the size , but it was the largest one in my kit.3 . The existing bolts are on pretty tight . A drop of penetrating oil on the screw made it easier to remove the bolts.4 . My Torx kit only had a cheap `` screwdriver '' handle to hold the Torx bits . I ended up destroying this handle because the existing screws were in so tight . It is probably worth buying a ratchet wrench setup before you start.5 . One tip- when installing the new strut , it helps if you snug up the upper screw first . This slightly lifts the strut , making it easier to line up the bottom screw.Hope that helps . The whole process was actually pretty easy- if you can use a socket wrench , you can do this.UPDATE : 9/9/13After 7 months of relatively light use ( I open the tailgate roughly 3 times per week ) , my opinion of these has gone from 5 to 1 star . They still work , but they make so much noise I am ashamed to open my tailgate within 100 yards of people . Opening or closing the gate will result in a very loud screech from both struts . Not an annoying little squeak , but a very lout , annoying , nails-on-a-chalkboard screech.I have tried a film of oil , silicon spray and creative language , but nothing will remove the screech.I finally tracked down the StrongArm supplier , AVM industries and left an email message on their customer service website.Update 9/24/13I guess after 2 weeks , they have no intention of replying to their emails .

Purchase with caution , or just settle for the non-spinning versions from either Camco or other vendors.Another word of caution - pre-drilling the holes for the mounting screws on your tanks is not recommended even though the instructions recommend it .

And he unleashes this nihilism in a sweeping , razor-edged concept album , full of pointed lyrics and ominous electro-rock.It opens with the rapid drums of `` Hyperpower , '' an intro that weaves in some fuzzy bass and spasmodic electronica . It segues into a tight , spare hard-rocker with squiggling synth , with Reznor being drowned out as he sings , `` Down on your knees/You 'll be left behind/This is the beginning/Watch what you think/They can read your mind ... '' The songs that follow are suitably bleak hard-rockers laced with synth -- the undulating creepy `` Survivalism , '' slow-burning hard-rock ballads , explosive muscular rockers , razor-edged electrorock , and the rapid smash'n'rapping of `` Capital G , '' which is unsurprisingly about a certain president . `` Year Zero '' is a tight coil of nihilistic rock , unwinding to show off its dark message as the songs go on . While society has never utterly crumbled all at once , this album sounds like the soundtrack to the ultimate apocalypse movie , with hints of oppression and corruption from all sides.His music is basically a combination of hammering bass and drums and a tight muscular guitar . There 's also that classic electronic edge -- jabs of steely synth sometimes , squealing screeches at others , and frenetic squidges at others . It 's all twisted together into ominous , unstoppable melodies.And Reznor howls out haunting songs , which are full of misery , numbness , some rather excessive jabs at religion , jagged political barbs , laments , and sometimes gleeful anger ( `` Come on down , my friend/It 's time to meet your MASTER ! '' ) . The rapping sound was a bad idea , though -- it sounds too forthright for the rest of the album.But there seems to be a faint glimmer of hope in the final song , where he intones `` May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts , '' and relates , `` And I guess I just wanted to tell you , as the lights start to fade , /That you are the reason that I am not afraid ... as the heavens will fall , /We will be together soon if we will be anything at all .

I almost cried when I heard the vocal delivery on Capital G. Bottom line is this : the music is fantastic , prolly the best brooding noise/electronica I 've heard in almost a decade .

Although he has covered this ground before ( The excellent `` Downward Spiral '' was certainly conceptual in nature ) , this time around he delivers a vision of a full-fledged dystopian near-future America , in which Christianity is the official state religion , citizens are under surveillance by the `` United States Bureau Of Morality '' , and mysterious aliens may have finally decided to wipe us out like the virus we are . Compelling and topical stuff.Musically , this disc delivers the nihilistic machine-like weirdness the way only Reznor can . Full of the requisite programmed drumming , off-kilter distorted guitar riffs mutated and bent beyond recognition by signal processing , and throbbing bursts of static and nearly ( but not quite ) recognizable noises and sounds , this may be the first `` progressive '' industrial album .

Trent 's voice and the passion and emotion that he delivers through out most of his work is very good as well.. and compliments the music very nicely.. When With Teeth came out I was expecting another great album ( I was listening to The Fragile often around that time.. ) but With Teeth was just not great at all..

This might not matter so much if Trent Reznor was not the musical genius he is . If he was content to sit back and make a living by imitating the sound of `` Spiral '' , it would only be fair that he would never top it . But that 's not the kind of musician he is . He 's going to experiment and grow and always mature as an artist , and nothing pisses off music fans like their favorite bands doing new things . I mean , just look at Metallica.The followup to `` Spiral '' was `` The Fragile '' , which was a boring , laborious double album that really should n't have been . It had a few good songs , such as the title track , but for the most part it was self-indulgent , repetitive , and just plain dull . After that came `` With Teeth '' , which was short , catchy , and for the most part , radio-friendly . I have no problem with that album , but it was bit lame for Nine Inch Nails . It seemed that good old Trent has had problems coming up with a record to even compare to his masterpiece.The new album `` Year Zero '' is not that album either , but for the record , it is better than both `` Fragile '' and `` Teeth '' . What really amazed me was that he made a new album so fast . There was a five year wait between Spiral and Fragile , and then a six year wait until Teeth , which only came out two years ago . Maybe he should focus on making albums faster in the future . `` Year Zero '' is definitely NIN 's best album since `` Spiral '' . It is more biting and relevant than `` Teeth '' , and much more focused and straightforward than the rambling `` Fragile '' . It has more of a techno sound that is reminiscent of `` Spiral '' , and is not as deliberately radio friendly as `` Teeth '' . I 'm sorry to define the album by comparing it to the others , but I think that 's the most efficient way.There are several great songs , such as `` Survivalism '' and my personal favorite , `` Capital G. '' Making fun of the Bush Administration is pretty easy these days , but the song is still good . The album is actually a sort of concept album , imagining what our lives might be like in the future . The environment , politics , war , religion , and the media are all put on display . And none of them get away without some serious criticism . Perhaps this focus is what makes the album so good . Each song has something very important to say . Some of the lyrics are absolutely brilliant.From `` Capital G '' : `` I pushed a button and elected him to office / and he pushed a button and it dropped the bomb . '' Also , `` Do n't try and tell me how some power can corrupt a person / You have n't had enough to know what it 's like . '' The song is basically a slam against Bush and the general Republican mindset.From `` The Warning , '' from the point of view of an alien race : `` We have come to intervene / You will change your ways and you will make amends / Or we will wipe this place clean . `` From `` God Given '' : `` I sure would n't want to be praying to the wrong piece of wood . '' Obviously , this song is against religious fundamentalists.One similarity this album does share with `` Teeth '' is the sing-songy nature of the lyrics . Many of the choruses have a very catchy rhythym , which I do n't mind if they 're saying something interesting . But the music is more complex and more inspired in general.Like I said before , Trent Reznor is never going to top `` The Downward Spiral '' . But even with that in mind , `` Year Zero '' is his best album since then and totally worth buying . Actually , it 's worth buying just for the USBM Warning on the back . That was just awesome ."}, "24966": {"id": "24965", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I just listened to this on my ITunes today , and I played it in complete sequence , one track after the other . I believe this is the way this particular album deserves to be listened to . Let it be known , this is , to me , Nine Inch Nails best CD to date - even besting the debut `` Pretty Hate Machine '' , which remained one of my favorite rock albums for years before Fiona Apple released `` When the Pawn '' ( which is a rock album , nuff said ) .Like Tori Amos ' `` Scarlets ' Walk '' , this CD zones in one place and time and makes you think about action , consequence , and solution . I found this riveting . Even though you may not find anything in common between this CD and Tori 's ` Walk ' , the similarities screamed out to me upon first listen . Musically , they are varied , but the mind its coming from is in the same place , I think.What I especially liked is the questioning of fascism , socialism , oppression , democracy and the concept of extinction , all on one record ( read the lyrics - its all there ) . What concept Trent originally had for this is questionable , but its an amalgamation of all things . In a nutshell , it asks you whether the year 2022 is the year you think it will be , based on what the world is going through right now . Once you answer that , it asks you what you 'd like to do to achieve the utopia that the year could be . However , I also got the distinct impression that Trent has decided that Year Zero is definitely going to be an End Year , where Armageddon finally comes and blows us out of the water.Each listener will no doubt get different things from this album . Any album that can do that in my opinion , is great . I 'd suggest listening to this CD and Tori 's aforementioned album side by side , or one after another . A surreal experience to be sure , and one you should definitely repeat ! Four Stars . An instant masterpiece no doubt , but Trent could have done much better outlining his concept .

I 've been a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails for a long time and Reznor had never disappointed me . Even though I did n't think `` With Teeth '' was his best effort , I had a feeling it was leading up to something even bigger than the fans and even Reznor could have ever imagined . And that is this supreme entity that is `` Year Zero . '' I can not tell you how many times I 've listened to this entire album , as I have lost count . Trust me , I 'm sure it 's in the hundreds somewhere . `` Year Zero '' being a conceptual album tells the story of a very bleak and ultimately hopeless America in the future where power and greed has overtaken the country , the government is in control of everyone and everything , and not only that , a sort of `` presence '' from another world , another universe has given us a stern warning to change our ways or face our terrible annihilation . While the album does tell a story , gives us different perspectives and such , it still works as a full length album that 's enjoyable to listen to all the way through even if you do n't pick up on all of that from the start.It 's really hard to put in words what an impression this album has left on me , but I 'll do my best . After hearing this album , it now becomes clear and it seems like all the other past albums were leading up to this moment . I think Trent knew all along he would make this album , it was just a question of time . The music and the lyrics are hypnotically stunning and Reznor 's still got it as far as vocals are concerned . There are verses and choruses that will stay with you and refuse to get out of your head , especially the last haunting chorus in `` zero-sum . `` This is really an album that you want to listen to all the way through every single time . Sure , there are songs that are my favorites , but the experience comes from listening to the entire thing . It 's rare when I want to do that , and also listen to it in the exact order that it 's presented . My favorites are `` the beginning of the end , '' `` survivalism , '' `` the good soldier , '' `` capital g , '' `` the warning , '' `` in this twilight , '' and `` zero-sum . '' Again , I love the entire album , but those are my favorites.Just keep this in mind , if you 're expecting another `` Downward Spiral , '' you will be disappointed . Know why ? Because `` Year Zero '' sounds like `` Year Zero . '' It 's a different entity from the other past efforts . Also , this is one that requires multiple listens as you 'll pick up something new each time . So , make sure you listen to it a bunch of times all the way through before you make your decision .

'' The vid for Survivalism has a military `` Task Force '' busting into the bedroom of a Homosexual couple and presumably killing them and dragging them away ... pretty disturbing !

But now it seems that it was just him trying to figure out if he could still make music . That fact being proven , Trent now decided to take his work a little more seriously . The culmination of this ( and numerous recording sessions during breaks in between shows during the 2005-06 With Teeth tour ) is Year Zero.Year Zero ( YZ ) features 16 tracks , making it the second longest Nine INch Nails ( NIN ) album next to 1999 's `` The Fragile '' . The sound of YZ is much more in line with NIN 's industrial roots , but even more so , it draws on the sounds of electro clash , drum and bass and minimalist techno . In other places it features classical piano . Yet in the end , YZ has the unmistakable sound of Trent Reznor 's work.YZ is also a concept album , with an interesting science fiction/political storyline going on throughout it . There is also an `` Alternative Reality Game '' going on to promote the album , which in itself helps bolster the otherwise boring and hackneyed `` packaging '' that the album would normally have had if it were any other CD . To engage in this so called ARG , one should seek out the official Nine Inch Nails website or `` The NIN WIKI '' .The choice picks from this album would be the following : -The `` My Sharona '' drum pattern using `` The Beginning of the End '' , which might have a cliche title ( and drum beat ) , but its sound is as refreshing and invigorating as a blast of adrenaline mixed with licking an electric socket when it seems like the fight has just turned against you.-The haunting and beautiful `` The Good Soldier '' , which has some very thought provoking lyrics and rhyming built into it . The best part comes at the end when it transforms from a stripped down bass driven industrial track to a `` Fragile '' -esque piano laden track with a mixture of electronic goodness.-Sleeze and power tripping ( something NIN is known best for ) sets in on the track `` Vessel '' . This track in particular features a mess of thundering choruses and a break down section of chaotic and erratic industrial and minimalist techno noises . Some electro house is thrown in as well for good measure . If anything , this is definitely one of the tracks that Reznor said : `` You could f*** to.. '' -The political ( and ALMOST ) ambiguous `` Capital G '' , which features some clever humor and loud , grinding guitar moments . Rather than trying to describe this track , it should just be heard ! You will most likely hear it since it has been chosen [ Edit : as of the time this review was written ] to be the second single off of the album.-And the thundering , overpowering `` Meet Your Master '' , which rings in memories of NIN 's `` Broken '' , along with some more beautiful , loud electronic chaos . This track has it all : A strong chorus , Trent 's signature creepy thoughts , catchy hooks and a layering of distortion guitars and noisy synthesizers.In actuality , this album really does not have any dull moments . There is enough change up and diversity that keeps the album from ever growing stale . The only concern I have is that with such a climatic and `` apocalyptic '' end track on the album , how will there be a sequil to this concept album* ? Perhaps we 'll find out more as the storyline for Year Zero progresses ... As you can judge from the star rating , this reviewer was ONE happy customer with the purchase of YZ . It is a delight to see that NIN is still capable of making fresh music that is both good and thought provoking . I HIGHLY recommend picking up YZ , as well as also at least giving the accompanying ARG that the album has going on with it ."}, "24975": {"id": "24974", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I love Buckethead 's music !

There is some inclusion of house on the Chris Lake Remix that is quite fun.The Shapeshifters Remix starts off quite well with a nice tease . Riffs & Rays Mix has house elements then switches into electronica and is probably the version that varies most from the original as the voice is secondary to the beat . It 's my current favorite after the LMC Edit . The Fugitive Club Mix is just OK.All in all I am very impressed that Dannii has done such a great job with this song .

I would say Miranda 's live shows are the best of any live act in any genre.Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , the followup to her debut album Kerosene is a rockin ' country album .

That this `` Nashville Star '' graduate had a great voice is a moot point , but few could have predicted that she would make a timeless , classic album such as `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' so early in her career.The album title is unfortunate ( I would have preferred that she chose something more laidback or meaningful ) , but the album is most decidedly a grassroot country album that gives you true country in this era of pathetic pop-rock being passed off as country . One listen to this album and you will not be able to take Carrie Underwood or Taylor Swift seriously anymore . The 'country music ' that they make is fake , at best , but granted they know how to churn out good tunes.Miranda targets a different audience - one that knows its ' music , and one that respects the great tradition of country music . Its an art that few have appreciated , and a genre that very few have been able to truly embrace . I can safely say that Dolly Parton is the only female country artist who 'knew ' what country was all about , in my opinion , as she was the best storyteller of them all . `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' is a concept album about a relationship that dies . Every track tells a story that neatly segues into the next song and message . While Miranda is great with some killer tunes , her voice is the most appealing instrument here - her pitch and vocal control is simply amazing , and she has by FAR the most unique voice in country music right now - you ca n't confuse her with anyone else . And what a superb Southern accent ! Magnetic , is what I call her.Highlights for me are `` Down '' ( according to me the best track on the album , though it has n't been released as a single ) , and `` Desperation '' ( which sets the tone for the depressing subject matter the album contends with ) . The music here is vintage country and bluegrass , with rock elements rearing their head every now and then . Miranda is conscious of 'good tunes ' and its evident they tacked on a few great melodies here , but it all just works . The title track for instance , with its rural-vocal opening and slowburn start , is a perfect introduction to one killer of an album.An album or `` LP '' as it was once known , is a long player that needs to have a cohesive message . In this age of one or two hit singles and an album full of filler , its a rare treat that Miranda Lambert has taken time out to craft an album where every song tells a story , where every song has a discernible melody and personality of its ' own . To me , this country album epitomizes the very best of what the genre has to offer , and is easily one of the greatest country albums of all time.Introduce yourself to Miranda 's music , and you might just learn to appreciate what REAL country music is all about . In fact , if you listen to this album and then listen to Shania Twain , you 'll realize the vast difference . Lambert is bringing country back , and has single-handedly given back respect and dignity to a genre that has been overtaken by corporate muppets.Five Stars . An Epic Album that will go down in history as one of country musics ' best of all time ."}, "24988": {"id": "24987", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is a great cd , a beautiful young lady , whom has a lot of talent , I would order it again if I had too !

Most of the album has the same feel as her debut album , Keroseneand Lambert 's vocal range can be described as a female Hank Williams Sr. mixed with some Loretta Lynn . Lambert 's voice is very raw and has a feel of `` old country , '' rather than the typical over-produced and mixed recordings of most of the female country artists today . As I had to do with `` Kerosene , '' I listened to this album many times before I could appreciate all of the songs on it . And literally every song is good.One of the reasons this album is so exceptional , is that Lambert wrote or co-wrote 8 of the 11 songs , and the only thing she does better than singing is songwriting . Perhaps this understanding of the songs is the reason that her singing comes across with so much conviction.1 . Gunpowder and Lead , 4 . Crazy Ex-Girlfriend - fast-paced , and the only two songs that deviate slightly from Lambert 's `` old-country '' feel and sound more contemporary . `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' could almost be called a sequel to `` Kerosene . '' These will likely be the only radio-friendly singles . Given the chorus , they could just as easily have been sung by Gretchen Wilson , however a closer look at the lyrics show that despite the tempo of the music , these songs have a much more serious nature at second glance.2 . Dry Town , 3 . Famous in a Small Town - A closer look at Lambert 's life growing up in Longview , Texas.5 . Love Letters , 6 . Desperation , 7 . More Like Her - These are the only three songs written entirely by Lambert , and lyrically , are the best songs on the album . The tone in all three is pretty different , but they all have the quality of exceptional writing , that somehow the producers were able to put to fairly good music . `` Love Letters '' is a true country ballad , yet retains a modern feel.8 . Down , 9 . Guilty in Here - Somewhat forgettable songs , but they grow on you and are still fairly good.10 . Getting Ready , 11 . Easy From Now On - Lambert did not co-write either of these songs , which is unfortunate since they are two of the best on the album . `` Easy From Now On '' is probably my favorite musical track , and I enjoy her version even more than the one originally sung by EmmyLou Harris.Ultimately , `` Crazy Ex-Girlfriend '' is a follow up well-worthy of Lambert and showcases some exceptional songwriting and vocal talent . This is not traditional country music filled with ridiculously cheesy lyrics and the same chorus every 30 seconds , but introspective writing and an excellent followup from this rising young artist ."}, "24994": {"id": "24993", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is my all time favorite album .

And I have to say , as great as Moonsorrow 's grandiose Viking metal has been up to this point , especially the last one _VERIS & Auml ; KEET_ , this blows it away ! How do they keep doing this stuff ? ? ? ? Here , instead of a half-dozen epic songs like previous albums , _H & Auml ; VITETTY_ is just two-massive half-hour tracks where all of Moonsorrow 's supreme strengths are on display : crushing metal sound , tuneful metal arrangements with diverse instrumentation , borrowed folk melodies , drumming that is more `` percussionist '' than `` metal drummer '' , powerful choral chanting and screams for vox , and absolute Epicness whose footprint covers all kinds of evocative landscapes . The five-piece metal core of the band is accompanied by lots of acoustic guitars , synths , mouth harp , and accordion , and choral ensemble . Blastbeats are dominant only in one passage in per track , as Moonsorrow uses them with blasting riffs as peaks of violent emotional intensity . Much of the music is otherwise mid-tempo , with slower and quieter passages throughout . When these build-and-release patterns are masterfully spread out over half-hour epics and capped off with flattening endings , you get what is really one of the best metal albums of recent years , and ever . You must pick it up.The first track , `` Born of Ice/Stream of Shadows '' begins with several minutes of lugubrious chanting , crystalline electric guitar arpeggios , and rippling bass sounds that sound like a campfire . There is no metal until about six and a half minutes in , it spends its earlier moments building tension . Then after a slow quake of distorted , ascending scales , a mid-tempo chug with beautiful tremolo riffing and Sorvali screams of `` one note of the still landscape carrie [ d ] afar on the quiet lake '' . The middle passages that follow , from melodic folk melodies arranged for aggressive metal and breathtaking blastbeasts played to unabashed major key guitars , not to mention a wonderful part with grumbling set of low-octave keys on piano , vamping with crunching riffs ... all show absolutely perfect songcraft . There is a wonderful acoustic passage about 16-minutes in where an accordion lead accompanies strummed chords and rolling triplet beat . Everywhere the band shows incredible imagination and , I dunno what the word is ... MASTERFUL TASTE , maybe . Words are somewhat inadequate . The finale is uplifting with huge backdrop of orchestral sounding synths and voices , and the requisite chimes for extra effect . As it fades , the initial chord from the beginning is played once with those fiery sounding rumbles in the background , then it goes into the chanting-and-percussion jam that opens the next song.Impossibly it would seem , `` A Land Driven Into the Fire '' is even better than the first track . After the first part , there is a haunting minor-key passage for strummed acoustic guitar , mouth harp , accordion , and timpani . As it progresses , a ghostly wisp of electric guitar foreshadows the slow yet pitilessly heavy riff that eventually appears . The minor key passage is worked in again with more distorted conditions . The electric-acoustic mix is maintained beautifully for some time ... until essentially broken by the tsunami of the so-called Valhalla choir that appears in full-force , sounding very high in the mix and singing awesomely `` splinter your axes against the rocks ... shed your skin to reveal your flesh '' . there is a long build-up , and as with track 1 this piece covers huge territory , including another accordion-m.harp-acoustic guitar jam , and the breathtaking assault of razer-sharp black metal with hellfire drums & guitars at the 13-minute point , and parts like _bergtatt_-era Garm leading a militaristic army of Vikings on electric guitars inspired by black metal , folk , and prog rock . It is all absolutely spectacular , but the ending really pushes it over the edge . It is one of the greatest finales I 've ever heard in music , I get chills thinking about it ! Probably from about 20:00 to the final seconds with its quiet sounds ... amazing . It takes you off guard at one point by fading out to almost nothing , when you think `` that 's it , now there 'll probably be a long outro of nice little nature samples ... '' and it already would have been an awesome finale ... but then it kicks in again and it 's more awesome and triumphant even than before . CLASSIC.Every great band naturally comes to a peak , usually somewhere in the middle of their career . To inconsequentially speculate , _Chapter V_ is so amazing this could be Moonsorrow 's peak , and as such it is easily one of the best albums in its field . If the band can ever surpass this , I probably wo n't be able to handle it . The band is just so good they must be using sorcery !

No material later than `` Burrito Deluxe '' ( 1970 ) is included here.In 1968 , following on from the ground breaking `` Sweetheart Of The Rodeo '' ( critically acclaimed but commercially toxic ) , ex-Byrds Chris Hillman and Gram Parsons decided to continue following their dream of playing Country and Western sentiment ( white man 's blues ) within the framework of Rock - very risky given the background of the late 60 's counterculture ( think last reel of `` Easy Rider '' and all that ) . Their dream became `` The Gilded Palace Of Sin '' . It 's hard to know where to start when reviewing `` The Gilded Palace '' . Many thousands ( millions probably ) of words have been written in praise of this album . To me it 's an album which can be played ad infinitum - the last word in real country-rock ( not the saccharine Eaglesque fare we 've been subjected to since the early 70 's ) . Some songs have an almost Gospel feel about them , when the organ sound comes swirling through the mix . This is an album to be treasured . Moving on , `` Burrito Deluxe '' ca n't really compare with the first album - which still leaves it head and shoulders above about 90 % of everything else in the genre . The Burritos ' take on Dylan 's `` If You Got ta Go , Go Now '' has a punk-rock feel which pre-dates punk-rock by a good seven years .

Even people who like Muddy Waters are sometimes turned off by the `` sound of heavy machinery operating on a gravel road '' that was Howlin ' Wolf 's voice.Chester Arthur Burnett , the Howlin ' Wolf , stood about 6'4 '' and weighed close to three hundred pounds in his prime , and his raw , throat-shredding vocals sound positively frightening on early cuts like `` Moanin ' At Midnight '' and the clanging , piano-driven boogie of `` How Many More Years '' , his first R & B ; hit , and the one which allowed him to proudly state that `` I 'm the onliest one drove out of the South like a gentleman ! `` This is electric blues of the highest order , rough and tough and extraordinarily powerful . The songwriting credits are shared about equally by the omnipresent Willie Dixon , who plays bass on most of these cuts , and the Wolf himself , and while few of these songs are as well-known as Muddy Waters ' `` Hoochie Coochie Man '' or Elmore James ' `` Dust My Broom '' , they are quite as magnificent.Wolf 's tough `` Who 's Been Talkin ' '' is an incredibly gritty tour de force set to a thumping rhumba beat , and Dixon 's horn-driven rave-up `` Hidden Charms '' features perhaps the greatest guitar solo ever comitted to tape , courtesy of Jimmy Page 's and Eric Clapton 's hero ( as stated by themselves ) , the extraordinary Hubert Sumlin.Other highlights include `` Forty-Four '' , the eerie `` Smokestack Lightnin ' '' , the slide guitar-driven `` Little Red Rooster '' and the phenomenal `` Killing Floor '' , written by Howlin ' Wolf , shamelessly stolen by Led Zeppelin and covered by several others , but never surpassed , and featured here in the ultimate version , propelled by an incredibly catchy guitar riff by Hubert Sumlin , and with Buddy Guy on acoustic rhythm guitar.Almost every song is a highlight , actually . This CD is a corner stone in any serious blues collection ... hard-rocking , bone-crunching electric blues , burning with the sheer ferocity of Chester Burnett 's incredible voice.There was never anyone quite like the Wolf , and it does n't seem likely that there will be ."}, "25008": {"id": "25007", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Yes , absolutely the best collection of hits Howlin Wolf on the market .

The talk centered , rightly , on the dismal fate of many black recording artists who developed what would become Rock and Roll when the white artists like Elvis took it over and reaped the benefits of a mass audience . Well , those interviews occurred a while ago , back in the 1980 's , but Bo 's sense of not having been properly recognized I believe remained until his death . Yet , when one thinks of the sounds created by the founders of Rock and Roll can anyone deny that Bo 's primal beat was not central to that explosion ? I think not.Here , in one album we have , if not all of Bo 's creative work then a good part of it , at least a good place to start . Of course , the classic song Bo Diddley and its offshoots and variations are here . However , the one Diddley song that will probably outlive them all though is Who Do You Love . Although not a theme song it nevertheless expresses the raw energy of rhythm and blues/ rock/ carib sound like not other . Hell , George Throughgood was able to make a whole career on the basis of having covered that song and other Bo work ( and to be fair , covering the work of Elmore James and Hound Dog Taylor as well ) .And that is a good point to finish on . The really great rockers , and Bo is in that company , unlike the one-shot johnnies get covered because their work expresses something that someone else later wishes to high heaven that they had created . ( George has been quoted directly on that point . ) Finally , I give the same warning here as others have given in their comments about the sameness of this CD and the Chess 50th Anniversary CD from 1997 .

Because the main focus of concerts and discography was sensational Tina , girls somehow stayed in the background and although they had surprising hit with `` I 'm blue ( Gong song ) '' Ike kept them in check and never spotlighted them enough to give them proper success or to encourage them for bigger things.Because so many girls went in and out of The Ikettes , it 's almost impossible to keep track on who sang when - first line-up who wailed behind 1960. r & b ; smash `` A Fool In Love '' were soon replaced with anybody available at the moment ( even white , soulful Bonnie Delaney was Ikette herself once ) so girls came and go faster than anybody could remember.Their soulful voices were excellent , to be sure - Ike would n't have them otherwise - and there is funny anecdote about how Turners auditioned them , they noticed that girls were either stunning looking or great singers but almost never same simultaneously.So there was a beauty or two who would find their way into The Ikettes simply for being effective on stage ( like girl on the cover picture in centre who was famous non-singing Ikette ) but for recordings girls were always top class.If singing was first-rate , music unfortunately was not always inspired - Ike would rather die than to let anybody run his business and mostly it 's his own , very recognisable ( some would say generic ) simple sound , with music usually warmed up leftovers from other recordings ( `` The Biggest Players '' , '' Blue on Blue '' ) but even if it 's not earth-shaking or epochal , I absolutely love it as it sounds far more authentic than any Motown-crossover hit where singers shooted at the white audience.Talking about motown , Ikettes had their Motown-moment with `` Peaches and Cream '' which is actually not bad at all , but my favorites here are real bluesy growls of `` You 're trying to make me loose my mind '' ( with Tina clearly audible in the background ) or `` Your love is mine '' with almost gospel call-and-response.It is clear that The Ikettes misfortunes were rooted not in music but in other outside factors - girls even left to record under name of The Mirettes - but other Ikettes came right in their shoes and continued the tradition.They can be heard on Frank Zappa album `` Over-nite sensation '' as backing vocals ( together with Tina ) where Ike demanded they sould not be overpaid , in fact the album was recorded in his own Bolic studio and as he was the Boss , Zappa had to pay them peanuts because Boss said so , otherwise they might get big-headed.Interesting note : some of The Ikettes ( Venetta Fields ) later made a good living as backing singers and could be heard on many pop albums , including Barbra Streisand `` Stoney End '' and `` A Star is Born '' soundtrack ."}, "25017": {"id": "25016", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "`` Naughty , Bawdy & Blue '' is a delightful blues fest .

After that , things level off a bit . `` Apartment Story '' is another hard-charged song that works great . Interesting to note that Sufjan Stevens plays piano on `` Racing Like a Pro '' and `` Ada '' .

Gavin Harrisons drumming is phenominal and Richard Barbieri 's key work is ethereal throughout . Listen how Barbieri weaves his keys around and behind Wilson 's guitar playing . Brilliant ! ! So far , for 2007 the best song imo , is easily `` Anesthetize '' a massive and epic tune . I do n't know , but we all better enjoy this while we can , having PT at our listening disposal . In my experience bands of this ilk only come around once every 10-15 yrs . 20 yrs from now will determine how important this music will become . The only quibble is the lyrics and concept , not Wilson 's best . But the music , this is Godly stuff ."}, "25043": {"id": "25042", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "How can one REALLY put into words the deep feel of great music ... ...

Thematically this album centers on the fear that today 's youth are becoming out of touch , imbibing on an excess of tv , computers , prescription drugs , and instant gratification , opting to live a life of self centered ease instead of a life full of achievement and challenge . The music is brilliant and the lyrics haunting . My two favorites off this album are `` Ashes '' , which I think is an amazing piece of work , and `` Anesthetize '' , a 17+ minute opus featuring Alex Lifeson of Rush on lead guitar . Robert Fripp makes an appearance on `` Way Out of Here '' , providing some very King Crimsonesque 'soundscapes'.I will admit that it took several times listening through this album to begin to understand and appreciate it , but that time has been rewarded .

The problem is , while very good , it is not consuming me like past PT records have . In fact , I would say it has no chance of breaking into my top 5 PT albums list , which consists of the five full-length studio albums prior to this one ( `` Signify , '' `` Stupid Dream , '' `` Lightbulb Sun , '' `` In Absentia , '' and `` Deadwing '' ) .The songs are all at least really good , as is the norm with a Porcupine Tree record.. The beast of an epic called `` Anesthetize '' is too stunning to describe with words . You just have to hear it . The title track is a good rocker , and manages to sound `` Deadwing '' -ish at times .

After I listened to it once , I was struck at the slight evolution their music appeared to take on it . Now , I ca n't stop listening to it .

Steven Wilson repeats the same lineup he 's had for the past five years . Besides them , the band is accompanied by King Crimson legend Robert Fripp on soundscapes in `` Way Out Of Here '' , Rush 's Alex Lifeson on guitar in `` Anesthetize '' and John Wesley , who had previously appeared onIn AbsentiaandDeadwing , also doing and producing guitar work.The end result is an amazing prog rock album that leaves the genre breathing comfortably and one of the best albums of 2007 ."}, "25048": {"id": "25047", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I waited awhile before writing this review because it takes time to really ingest the masterpiece that is Fear of a Blank Planet .

Quite simply put , this is the result of hard work , dedication , and talent . Although I found the subject matter of this particular Steven Wilson tale to be a little less visceral and involved than some of the previous efforts , but than again I also found myself riveted to the lyrics as the music carried me along on a path not beaten since my early days of vegging to old Floyd albums . Yes , this is a concept album in every sense of the word , complete with a 17 minute epic that is really several fine works amalgamated into one continuous and flawless epic . The musical soundscapes are all at once beautifully lush , wonderfully ambient and have the effect of being extremely heavy without becoming oppressive or weighty . The production is as always flawless , and Steven Wilson has again surrounded himself with key players replete with astounding musical proficiency . There is even a cameo from Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson that while resplendent , is still somewhat understated given the vast talents of this man . All in all I must say that if you are indeed a fan of Porcupine Tree or even if you just jumped on the bandwagon after say , Stupid Dream , you can not go wrong with this wonderfully created musical journey into the realm of teenage angst and quiet rebellion .

If it was born in the 70 's lets say , I 'd be standing on my tail on this very page , telling you how they do n't make 'em like this anymore ; another satisfactory category for 'FOABP'.It 's got fiery rock guitar , vast banks of whirling string-synth , staccato drumming , and a vocals-man , who obviously understands the lunacy of it all , singing brilliantly tongue-in-cheek lyrics with deadpan seriousness . Irresistible combination that takes some topping.If prodded with something sharp , I 'd say 'My Ashes ' is my favourite song on 'FOABP ' , but it 's a close run thing ( Important point here pop kids : 'FOABP ' deals in the song side of 'prog ' , not like that utter waste 'the Wall ' , that deals in pretension and regressive self-congratulation ) .The 17 minute ( feels like 5 , you just do n't want it to end ! ) 'Anesthetize ' is obviously the centre-piece and HAS to be superb to fend off all the other goodies which are attacking it from all sides , and 'Sentimental ' is another classy ballad .

I received my CD the day before a week 's holiday in Greece , so immediately downloaded said product onto my mp3 player and listened to it continuosly ( Alongside the new Rush CD `` Snakes and Arrows '' ) . I was present at a Manchester Gig where the band played the whole album six months before it was due to be released so I had a bit of an inclination as to what to expect . It sounded mostly like a continuation of their previous 2 albums ( Deadwing and In Absentia ) at the time , but having listened to the finished article , there were a couple of tracks where `` Lightbulb Sun '' came to mind on the 2 softer tracks ( i.e . My Ashes and Sentimental ) and a touch of `` Sky moves sideways '' atmospherics appears elsewhere . The begining of `` My Ashes '' is very close to Led Zeps `` No Quarter '' . So much has been made of `` Anesthetize '' , and yes , it is without doubt the highlight of the album . The opening to this song is monumental . However , I feel the album could have offered more to us , the fans . Firstly , I believe that `` Anethetize '' should have been chopped into two parts . After 12 or so minutes , it is turned into a completely different vibe and is like a totally new song . Steve Wilson had great joy at introducing the song at Manchester as `` 18 minutes long '' , and the crowd response was just as enthusiastic at hearing the news . Neal Morse 's new CD has a 3 tracks on his new CD `` Sola Scripture '' averaging 23 min . each , and yet each is made up of 6 songs within it . In this case I would rather skip to a favourite piece of the track than have to fast forward . Prog . music is `` Very much alive '' . I would rather have 4 x 5 minute songs highlighting Mr Wilson 's amazing musical talents than one stretched out piece . On `` Voyage 34 '' that was a different story . AHHHHH Voyage 34 . That brings me to another small matter . That CD ( Or `` EP '' as it was known ) totalled 60 min . whereas F.O.A.B.P . ( A full album release ) totals only 50 min . Why is that so ? Finally , I believe the 2 main ingredients that were lacking on this release were the trademark harmonies and also the lack of any guitar solos , apart from Alex Lifeson 's shortis piece on Anesthetize . Steve seems to be putting more emphasis on the heavier chunky sound . Who knows , we could be witnessing an Opeth-like sound on their next release . To me , This CD was like listening to `` Animals '' after the release of `` Wish you were here '' . Do you understand where I am coming from ? Animals was a great album , but not up to the class of Wish you were here . I got more satisfaction listening to both the Blackfield albums honestly.FOOTNOTE - I have just come across a tape of Steve talking on an English Radio station and explaining more about the concept of the album , and it really stuck with me i.e . about the information technology overload our kids have to indulge in . When you go into friends houses , all you see is kids on their Playstations/Nintendos/X box/Laptop etc . I must admit , Steve has really hit the button on an issue to write songs about . No doubt , there is more to come on this subject . For some people , the songwriting is the most important . For me , it is the music that is more paramount . I have to like the music first before I analyse the actual lyrics . When both are merged together in exceptional form the result is a CLASSIC ."}, "25054": {"id": "25053", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 'm a relatively new Tree fan . The first time I discovered them was about three months after Deadwing was released . But in that time , they 've become my favorite band . The way they weave lush textures and dreamlike soundscapes around incredibly catchy melodies is an experience that one would be hard-pressed to find anywhere else . And that 's what Tree music is : an experience . Perhaps their earlier album-oriented records more than their recent song-driven albums , but FOABP is clearly a trip back to their roots . Think as if they had taken the metal out of the last two albums and stuck it into Signify , and you 've got a vague idea as to what FOABP has . But like any other PT album , this one 's tough to classify.This album , however , is not resonating with me like previous albums . It 's definitely a very good album , and it 's definitely more consistent and better than Deadwing , though it just seems to lack the highlights that DW had ( `` Anesthetize '' is no `` Arriving Somewhere '' , but then again , nothing is ) . DW is one of my least-favorite Tree albums , but it did have its moments . FOABP is consistently good throughout , but it never really touches greatness like their masterpieces have.At times , it just feels like PT is trying too hard to outdo itself . I love the 12-minute epic , `` Arriving Somewhere '' , but `` Anesthetize '' , while a very strong track , feels a little too proggy and just goes on for too long . The first two parts are awesome , but the third section ( the song can easily be broken up into three parts ) just feels tacked on to extend it , and it 's honestly a little boring . I hope PT does n't go into Dream Theater territory of trying to put a 20-minute song on every album just because so many people think that any song over 10 minutes is a good song by default.The musicianship is great , even though virtuosity is the last thing I look for in a PT album . Gavin Harrison is quickly showing that he 's one of the greatest and easily the most underrated drummer in the business . Richard Barbieri comes to the forefront on this keyboard-driven album , adding the texture and atmosphere that anyone would expect from a PT album . Listening to this album without headphones would be doing a great disservice to it.But this album IS consistently very good . The title track sounds a bit like Deadwing 's title track , but better . It 's heavier ; the guitar and drums in the intro catch you immediately ; the textures during the chorus cascade in a wall of sound that is precedent for the rest of the album . `` My Ashes '' is a little straightforward and feels like a slightly more lush Blackfield song , but it 's an emotional highlight . `` Sentimental '' follows in this vein with a catchy chorus and more keyboard textures . `` Way Out of Here '' may be the weakest song on the album , but it 's still a good song with ethereal textures , although it goes on for a little too long . `` Sleep Together '' is the highlight of the album . When the keyboards warble in , the listener immediately feels as if he has been thrown into a nightmare . Given the song 's meaning about suicide and escape from this world that the album has been presenting , it 's easily the most sinister song PT has ever released , and in stark contrast to the lulling and gentle album closers PT has been known for . The strings are brought to the forefront and provide what is likely the strongest texture of the album.Still , the album is nowhere near perfect . The lyrics need work . The concept of a youth corrupted by Xbox , prescription drugs , MTV , pornography , and the Internet is presented in the title track , but nothing new is really presented until `` Sleep Together '' , when the idea of suicide is brought out . The prescription drugs idea is overused in every song . PT was never really known for their lyrics , but for an album that 's only 50 minutes long , you would imagine they 'd know how to mix it up a little better . And that 's another weakness : the album is a little too short , especially when you consider there are only six songs . Yes , the songs are generally pretty long , but by the time `` Sleep Together '' comes to its powerful conclusion , you 're left wanting more.The greatest issue I have is that FOABP just does n't deliver on every front . None of the songs have any subtlety to them . The wall of sound is good to an extent , but at times , less might just be more . The album just feels too heavy all around , even on the lighter songs . The strength of In Absentia , their second-strongest album in my opinion , was that it seemed to incorporate everything they 've ever done . It may have been less consistent , but it touched on every base and took you on an emotional rollercoaster . Stupid Dream , my favorite PT album , had the greatest power to manipulate the mind and created the perfect bridge between their purely psychedelic albums and their rock-oriented albums . FOABP , on the other hand , just seems to hit you like a wrecking ball over and over again . The death metal section at the end of the second section of `` Anesthetize '' personifies this perfectly . That 's okay when that 's what you 're looking for , but that 's not what I 've come to expect from the Tree . I did n't come to listen to Opeth.Do n't let this keep you from buying the album , though . It 's a great album and still miles ahead of 95 % of the crap that 's out there . But in the high standards that I hold for my favorite band , I just feel a little let down . Just a little.Fear of a Blank Planet - 9/10My Ashes - 8.5/10Anesthetize - 9.5/10Sentimental - 8/10Way out of Here - 7.5/10Sleep Together - 10/10"}, "25055": {"id": "25054", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 'll keep it short , an 18 minutes track ( anesthetize ) that takes you places , that alone is worth the money , the rest is just gravy .

In certain circles , at any rate , there has been a lot of rather assuming talk , with phrases like potential ` album of the year ' thrown around . Ancillary to this , some of us were privileged enough to hear the entire thing in rough , prototype form live last year , and the textures and dynamics evident in some of the entrancing music we heard that evening certainly suggested something special waiting in the wings . Finally , a lot has been made of the fact that ( supposedly ) this album functions as one continuous 50-minute cycle of music , and that the lyrics deal pretty much exclusively with Wilson 's fears that the younger generation is risking descent into intellectual torpor owing to their addiction to an oh-so lethal cocktail of prescription drugs , MTV , internet addiction and banal culture of necessary instant gratification.For me , however , none of the above really has much bearing on the album itself . Sonically , the six pieces here ( which are distinct enough not to flow together the way , say Light of Day , Day of Darkness does ) present an interesting proposition . Crucially , the narcotic core of their sound has been left largely intact , with outrageously catchy melodies , dense , layered and painstakingly executed production , careful , wandering bass-lines and lush , intricate harmonies all present in abundance . There is a slightly more heavy approach evident , but overall the album is remarkably spacey and dreamy , with a lot of attention given to synth washes , soundscapes and somnambulistic melodies , all rather reminiscent of their The Sky Moves Sideways era . But this is juxtaposed with the tight songwriting and straightforward riffing of later releases . If their are any new elements , and I 'm inclined to say there are , they emerge in subtle ways : Wilson 's vocals , which have changed little over recent years , seem more brazen and stretched , while some of the melodies seem more intricate , more assured and composed , and take time for the listener to fully appreciate.The title track turns on a riff that is highly reminiscent of ` Deadwing ' , while the chorus has a kind of gentle brutality that is somewhat jarring . The rhythmic vocals over the verse have an interesting , pseudo-rap like quality . The outro is dreamy and unexpected . ` My Ashes ' is stunning , with that perfect verse/chorus interplay Wilson excels at , lush orchestration and nebulous , highly evocative lyrics . The wordless vocal which rounds off the song engenders a kind of urbane emotional atmosphere , a beautiful dignity.And then to ` Anesthetize ' , which stands well out of the crowd simply by virtue of being 17 minutes long ! Live , this track was instantly memorable and impressive , and here it does not disappoint . Wilson seems to have shoehorned just about every facet of his remarkable music making skills inside . The four minute introduction is sinister , haunting and deceptively melodic . The four to around 11 minute mark is utterly replete with intricacies , yet never overblown : indeed , it displays an uncanny use of shifting dynamics and sustained tension , of the kind Tool have often used so effectively . A slow build is embellished by an ornate Alex Lifeson solo with a welcome exotic tinge , before the heavy riffing slides into view , along with a great , eerie verse and one of their most breathtaking choruses . Then we are hit with something pretty surprising at 11 minutes - suffice to say the song implodes in spectacular fashion , and the excellent outro is ushered in , all sepia tinged sunsets and darkened skies.To follow that , the gorgeous ` Sentimental ' harks back to earlier albums slightly , with an intro reminiscent of ` Collapse the Light Into Earth ' , and a breakdown towards the end which re-introduces the riff from ` Trains ' in slightly moderated form , a happening I 've not entirely figured out . Despite this , the gentle lilt of the chorus is possibly Wilson 's most effective evocation of sheer melancholy ( no mean feat ! ) . ` Way Out of Here ' is perhaps the most interesting song , a kind of psychedelic metal experiment , although ` Sleep Together ' pushes it close , a kind of apocalyptic industrial tinged nightmare , with lyrics seeming to equate suicide with sexual release.Maybe not as much a massive leap forward then , as a consolidation , and certainly a near flawless , very tightly constructed album with a lot of depth , as the whole picture will take quite a lot of listens to emerge . Including only six songs does ensure welcome brevity and consistency . In many ways , which perhaps I 've not entirely made apparent , this is their most complex record ; at any rate , it is certainly extremely dense . Whether it is their best record , or album of the year is , however , open to debate . Nevertheless , it comes highly recommended ."}, "25057": {"id": "25056", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "THE BAND : Steven Wilson ( vocals , guitar , piano , keyboards ) , Richard Barbieri ( keyboards , synthesizers ) , Colin Edwin ( bass ) , Gavin Harrison ( drums & percussion ) .THE DISC : ( 2007 ) 6 tracks clocking in at approximately 50 minutes .

Label - Atlantic Records.COMMENTS : Continued brilliance from The Tree . While `` Fear Of A Blank Planet '' did n't hit me on first spin like `` In Absentia '' ( 2002 ) did , it 's still ultra fine music from PT mastermind Steven Wilson . Nothing new as far as lyrics go - still dealing with loneliness , rejection , a dark childhood , and a bleak future outlook . I feel `` Fear '' takes a step closer to the band 's past - reverting back to `` Signify '' ( 1996 ) and perhaps `` Stupid Dream '' ( 1999 ) - giving you much more mood and atmosphere , and less rock & pop . Where `` In Absentia '' and `` Deadwing '' ( 2005 ) had more tracks geared toward the 4 minute `` rock '' song , `` Fear '' gives you 6 lengthy tracks ( 4 of the 6 songs are 7 minutes or longer ... with `` Anesthetize '' just under 18 minutes all by itself ) . `` Fear '' starts off with the title track ... I feel this song is oddly similar to `` Deadwing 's '' title track . Though my least favorite track on the album , it 's still a good rock song with a husky jam in the middle ( though nothing groundbreaking ) . Track 2 is where the album takes flight for me . `` My Ashes '' starts slow with keyboards/piano and acoustic guitar ... with orchestra and the rest of the band joining in later . Simply a beautiful composition . On first listen , `` My Ashes '' hit me hard ... in the same vein as `` Even Less '' - one of my all-time favorite PT songs . `` Anesthetize '' is the marathon song - lengthy in all respects . As much as Lifeson 's guitar solo stands out ( his best work in 2007 is here , not on Rush 's `` Snakes & Arrows '' ) , it 's Harrison 's drumming that intrigues me . In fact , Harrison 's drumming throughout the album simply sparkles . `` Anesthetize '' features ups and downs and a wide range of emotions with some great guitar work from Wilson.. and this song is on par with PT 's other lengthy hard driving jam tune , `` Arriving Somewhere But Not Here '' from `` Deadwing '' . Through tracks 2 and 3 , there are several moments where the keyboards/synth reminds me of Led Zeppelin 's John Paul Jones ' work on `` No Quarter '' ... dark , eerie , perfect . `` Sentimental '' starts and closes as a pretty piano ballad with the band joining nicely in the middle ... another wonderful song . `` Way Out Of Here '' is the moodiest track - thanks to Robert Fripp ... a soft beginning and an extremely heavy ending . The closer `` Sleep Together '' starts out with a very industrial feel to it . But then it kicks in and synth/orchrestra takes over ... giving it a holier than tho tone . `` Fear Of A Dark Planet '' has a slightly different flavor to it then their last 2 albums ... maybe the new record label ( Atlantic ) had something to do with that ( probably not - though Lava Records , Snapper and Madfish labels may be a thing of the past for PT ) ; or maybe it 's been Wilson 's recent collaberative work with Aviv Geffen and their `` Blackfield '' albums which seem to be a bit mellower and more keyboard driven . Give this album time - it will get better with repeated spins . Either way , Porcupine Tree has the brains , the production tools , and the chops to release some great albums for years to come .

Where 'In Absentia ' succeeded in exploring a lot of different musical and thematic terrain , this album is very much a concentrated effort . That is n't to say that it does n't bring a lot of variety to the table , but there is a very clear concept.I feel like the time Wilson spent working with Opeth really paid off , and the heavier moments on this album and 'In Absentia ' definitely help keep things lively .

If you enjoyed Dark Side of the Moon or The Wall by Pink Floyd , Melancholie and the Infinite Sadness by Smashing Pumpkins , or Amused to Death by Roger Waters , chances are you 'll enjoy this CD as well.Unlike most bands categorized as progressive rock , Steven Wilson 's Porcupine Tree has always been able to inject tons of emotion into the music , even as they perform songs that change times and tempos and weave intricate lines and melodies together . FoaBP is no exception , and - keeping in mind that each PT album is distinct from the others - I think it 's their most brilliant album so far.Much like Amused to Death by Roger Waters , it took me a few listens to really appreciate this particular album . I was so used to Deadwing , their previous disc , which is a collection of very different songs that could work as the soundtrack for a script Wilson co-wrote with Mike Bennion . There are only six tracks on this CD , and they are not radio friendly ( a plus in my book ) .As for the songs on this album , `` Fear of a Blank Planet '' comes out of the gate with percussive acoustic guitar picking that 's soon joined by swirling guitars and PT 's trademark drum sound . `` My Ashes '' is the closest you 'll get to `` Lazarus '' on FoaBP - it 's just as beautiful as Lazarus but in a darker way - and you can feel the lonliness and disconnection in the words and warbling keyboards . `` Anesthetized '' is the long centerpiece of FoaBP , somewhat like `` Arriving Somewhere '' is on Deadwing , but it 's actually two songs put together ( a 12 minute piece featuring Rush 's Alex Lifeson on the guitar solo , and a 4 minute piece with amazing vocal harmonies that are far less poppy than the ones on `` In Absentia '' ) .Listening to `` Sentimental '' , you 'll know how it feels to grow up anesthetized and come out of it older and lost . `` Way out of Here '' expresses the disconnect from family and the loss of attachment and affinity for those who care.Porcupine Tree are musicians of the finest caliber , and Steven Wilson is progressive rock 's best songwriter . FoaBP tells an emotional story of depression , alienation , drug abuse , and apathy . By time you hear `` Sleep Together '' you too might think that the cure for it all is to burn your clothes , erase everything from your computer and online profiles , and find refuge in the closeness of another human being.After all , is n't that what we 're subconsiously seeking through our devices and material objects ?"}, "25061": {"id": "25060", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I highly anticipated this release from Prog . Rock greats Porcupine Tree , and I was n't dissapointed . This album follows the pretty much the same formula , as far as musical style , as their 2 previous albums In Absentia and Deadwing . But there is some new wrinkles , and some good wrinkles at that . First off , this album 's concept becomes more clear than previous PT releases . Themes of this album , as taken from their official website are : `` a 21st century cocktail of MTV , sex , prescription drugs , video games , the internet , terminal boredom , and subsequent escape . '' As usual , Steven Wilson has written some great songs here , both lyrically and musically . Though there are only 6 tracks here , they mesh together very well , so well , they could fit together to become one long track . As said before , musically , the album sounds quite similiar to the last 2 PT releases , with heavier guitar parts mixed with great melodies and beautiful piano pieces that pull you in . And though I really like this album , I can not automatically give this release 5 stars . One reason is that I think the theme of the album is so apparent , it kinda takes away from the listener 's imagination a bit . The lyrics are so direct at times , the listener ca n't always attach their own meaning to them . For the most part , I enjoy lyrics that say a lot without telling you nothing ... if that makes sense . Do n't get me wrong , these lyrics are n't bad , not by a long shot . Steven Wilson is an amazing lyricist as well as musician , but I just would have liked for the main theme of the piece to be a bit more indirect . My other complaint , though a small one , is the number of tracks . I know , when writing these kinds of `` concept '' albums , an artist should say what they want , and when the theme or message is done , it 's done . Whether its 1 , 5 , or 26 tracks..but as a fan , I 'm left wanting more than just 6 tracks . Now , granted , all the tracks are good lengths , especially with the song `` Anesthetize '' which clocks in at over 17 minutes . With that said , I would have to say , in my opinion , is the best overall track on the album . It starts off great , keeps the listener interested , and has great tempo changes , a great balance of musical interludes and lyrics ; everything you want from a track of this length.With all this said , if you 're a Porcupine Tree fan or just a prog . rock fan in general , you should love this album , there no reason not to . This is some really good material from this highly underrated band . They have been honing their craft for years , and Steven Wilson and Co. sound crisper and sharper than ever . I look forward to many more great albums from them in the future ."}, "25062": {"id": "25061", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "There is no doubt that PT is one of the better current rock groups , and `` Fear of a Blank Planet '' is another gem from this talented band . The only other discs I 've heard by PT are their previous two and `` Stupid Dream '' and for me , this is on par with those releases.The title track punch starts the disc with upbeat rhythms and a catchy although limited chorus . The verses rule on this tune . `` My Ashes '' is a spacey ballad with some awesome string arrangements and this is one of my favorite tunes on the disc . `` Anesthetize '' starts off sounding a little like Radiohead with a quiet medium tempo groove ; the tune builds slowly adding distorted guitars , heavier rhythms , a decent solo by Alex Lifeson and then some frenzied riffage takes over briefly . The last five minutes of the song are very mellow but tasty , almost Floydish . `` Sentimental '' is medium tempo hypnotic tune that borrows a lick from `` Trains '' towards the end of the song . The entire band wrote the music to `` Way Out Of Here '' , nice job , they should write more songs together . Another spacey intro builds into a heavy section with some tricky drum fills and double-kick work . The soundscapes by Fripp add a creepy vibe to parts of the song . Great tune . Finally , `` Sleep Together '' is kind of a popish tune with a repetitive keyboard rhythm that bounces through most of the song.Overall , this is a solid album with no filler and would be a good beginning for someone new to PT , but I 'm not sure why it 's causing so much argument between fans ."}, "25063": {"id": "25062", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is a great cd , capturing the Airplane on an exceptionally good night .

To add to this , the tracklisting for 'Spotlight ' looked overly familiar - and I was beginning to wonder whether there was actually ever a Balin era concert when they they did n't do 'The Other Side of This Life ' . I really should have known better . The Airplane 's capacity for innovation and reinvention is underpinned here by their trademark instrumental prowess and some wonderful three part harmonies . 'Pooneil'features a virtual masterclass in improvisation from Jack Casady as well as series of especially deranged and discordant 'Zappaesque ' sound effects at the beginning . In fairness it should be pointed out that two of the twelve performances appeared a few years back on the expanded ( Legacy ) version of 'Volunteers ' . But they sound far better here in the context of the whole concert - and we have a bonus in Balin 's 'Dresses Too Short ' - the only official version of this one we 've heard before is the one from the Box Set - dating from Marty 's one off performance with the band in 1972 . The attractive booklet contains a short but reflective essay from Jorma Kaukonen . This concert represents the Airplane at their most musically mature . Woodstock and their five classic studio albums are behind them . And yet the purity of their music has yet to be compromised by the departure of Marty Balin and the arrival of later extraneous members .

He was responsible for half of Amy Winehouse'sBack to Black , produced a track on Lily Allen'sAlright , Stilland a track on Adele's19 , which I 'm really getting into at the moment.On this album - a selection of cover versions - he displays an incredible talent for musical reinterpretation . I 've been resisting this album ever since it came out but eventually caved in . I 'm so glad I did . I feel like I already own it anyway , as I know all the singles he 's released from it so far ( from the radio ) and really love the innovative and thought provoking videos he put out to promote them.The man is certainly eclectic , going over tunes by the likes of The Zutons , Coldplay , Radiohead , The Jam , Britney Spears , Kaiser Chiefs and Kasabian , just to name a few , and reinterpreting their music in ways that I personally find very difficult to categorise . It 's good stuff though ; modern with a hint of retro with some banging beats . My favourites include `` Stop Me '' featuring Daniel Merriweather , `` Valerie '' featuring Amy Winehouse and `` Oh My God '' featuring Lily Allen . They all sound much better on my system at home than they did on the radio or on MTV Base . His version of Coldplay 's `` God Put A Smile On Your Face '' featuring The Daptone Horns ( Ronson definitely loves his horns ) is also really cool and currently being used on practically every reality/factual TV programme here , or so it seems , and I also enjoy `` Amy '' featuring Kenna and `` LSF '' featuring Kasabian . I thought I 'd like `` The Only One I Know '' featuring Robbie Williams ( Ronson is reported to be working on Williams ' forthcoming album ) but I did n't , no matter how hard I tried to . His version of Britney Spears ' `` Toxic '' featuring Tiggers ( and O.D.B . ) is certainly hysterical if nothing else and I 'm just starting to like his new single `` Just '' , the old Radiohead song , which on here , features Phantom Planet.The man 's done good and has had a very good run . `` Stop Me '' made it to # 2 on the UK Top 40 , he won a producer of the year 2008 Grammy the other day for producing his portion of `` Back To Black '' and won best male 2008 Brit Award - the first time the award has been given to someone who did n't actually sing on the winning album - and `` Valerie '' , which also made it to # 2 , is currently the longest reigning single in the UK Top 40 .

I am not alone in that regard and there are Greg Lake fans who go back to before Emerson , Lake and Palmer when he was the lead singer for King Crimson , which explains why `` In the Court of the Crimson King '' is the opening track in the concert on the first disc of `` Greg Lake : Live in Concert . `` I was rather surprised that most of the songs in the concert are from the ELP days including `` From the Beginning '' ( just once I would love to see Lake start that song on the guitar and launch into `` Roundabout '' instead ) , `` Touch and Go '' ( Okay , that is an Emerson Lake and Powell song , but two out of three ai n't bad ) , a version of `` Take a Pebble '' that takes advantage of Florian Opahle on acoustic guitar , `` I Believe in Father Christmas , '' `` Farewell to Arms , '' `` Fanfare for the Common Man , '' `` Footprints in the Snow , '' `` Lucky Man , '' `` Pictures at an Exhibition , '' and `` Karn Evil 9 ( 1st Impression - Part 2 ) '' for the encore . I was even more surprised that `` Lucky Man '' was really the only ballad that Lake sang ( he tells the story of how it became the last addition to ELP 's debut album ) , because I was expecting to hear more songs like `` Still ... You Turn Me On '' and some of the tracks from his side of ELP 's `` Works : Volume 1 . '' I should add that `` The Sage '' part of `` Pictures at an Exhibition '' would count as being a ballad . But the only song from his solo career in the concert is `` Love You Too Much '' and there is a second King Crimson track with `` 21st Century Schizoid Man . '' The concert is enjoyable and while Lake is losing power on his upper register there are plenty of moments in many of these songs where he does not have to go that high and I remember why his was the voice I coveted most in my youth.The second disc starts off with what would be called `` Greg Lake : Live in Rehearsal , '' which consists of a half-dozen full length tracks from the pre-tour rehearsals ( all performed on disc 1 except for one of the aforementioned missing ballads ) mixed with backstage footage and interviews with band members and others associated with the tour . A short documentary on `` The Band '' has more interviews with the members , who explain how they came to be in Greg Lake 's band ( there is a nice bit where David Arch , who plays keyboards and is the group 's musical director , explains how they did not intend to go the whole Keith Emerson route with lots of keyboards but could not avoid picking up an organ , a moog , a couple of more keyboards and eventually a second keyboard player ) . The final treat is a live performance of `` I Believe in Father Christmas '' performed live at St. Bride 's Church on London 's Fleet Street . Lake plays one of the two acoustic guitars accompanied by a keyboard player , the church 's choir and Jethro Tull 's Ian Anderson on flute . The sound is not perfect ( I have trouble understanding the minister 's introduction ) , but fan 's will still be enthralled .

The tone poem Pohjola 's Daughter is also much more than just a filler and makes the single instruments and performances incredible transparent.Let 's hope that Sir Colin will soon finish his ( probably last ) Sibelius cycle with the fabulous LSO and will end it with a great Sibelius First with exactly as much grandeur as this awesome Second has !"}, "25086": {"id": "25085", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "British critics are slavish admirers of Colin Davis 's Sibelius , and this CD is touted as a Gramophone Selection of the Month .

However , it 's hard to resist the utterly clear and natural sonics that the LSO Live engineers deliver , far better than anything Davis got form Philips or RCA/BMG his first two times out -- this is his third complete Sibelius cycle.As for the interpretation , it 's patient and measured , but with lots of inner detail and great pacing for effect . I do n't know if Davis has become a master or if I am simply more tolerant of his understated style . Barbirolli brought a similar measured individuality to the Sibelius Second in his famous recording ( Chesky ) , but he was more emotional and rhythmically free than Davis . Davis does n't give us much drama from moment to moment ( The Gramophone turns this lack into a virtue , claiming that it 's all about long-term buildup and architecture ) , but the LSO musicians play beautifully , and the engineers keep up the sexcellent sound.Is there a great buildup to a cathartic climax ? In the first movement I 'd say yes , although Bernstein is more hair-raising and Karajan more grand . English restraint still counts for a lot in Davis 's style -- the second movement does n't pull you back and forth as violently as it could , but the orchestral sound is deep and rich . The Vivacissimo scherzo should be a whirlwind ; here it 's only a strong breeze , and the gorgeous oboe melody in the trio is lethargic . The finale should burst on the scene in tidal waves of brass chords and swooping strings , but Davis 's retraint holds the tide in check . NOt fatally , I should add . Wtihout being volcanic , this Sibelius Second ends with a triumphant sweep.I am no expert in Davis 's other Sibelius cycles , having owned them only for a while , but if knowledgable critics claim that this is his best Second , I do n't mind agreeing .

'' I asked when hearing it at a friends house How tawdry I felt when I had to find the disc in the `` alternative '' section . But where does he belong ? He is a brilliant performer and a superb ( if somewhat idiosyncratic ) vocalist but what excites me the most is his ability as a composer . These are not just pop songs . Why not ? His emotional depth ( through music ) , melody , harmonic adventures and sophisticatedaccompaniment are those of a classical composer . Not just a one trick pony either . I like to think that Rufus was channelling some of these fellows on this album ... . '' Do I disappoint you '' : A swirling , decadent Szymanowskian splurge , complete with hints of Eastern mysticism and erotic dissonance.Going to a town : One of those perfect Mozart concerto middle movements where time stands still . When was the last time you heard a sequence of fourths used with such elegance and poignancy ? Tiergarten : It 's not just the German title . The sprightly , slightly odd accompaniment creates the perfect depiction of a garden stroll , while the vocal melody lets us know that deeper stuff is going on ... ... ... .Pure Schubert Lied.Nobody 's off the hook : Oh so Brahms . A folk like melody based on thirds which grows and surges to an exquisite climax , although the sense of longing is never satisfied , just a wistful acceptance . If that is not enough for you , it is accompanied by a piano quintet ... ... Hello ! ! Between my Legs : What a corker . While the opening somehow reminds me of Fleetwood Mac , the song soon takes on the characteristics and irresistible energy of a Verdi cabeletta ( `` when the rocket ships explode ... '' ) . The coda section suddenly switches over to a Richard Strauss extended climax ( as we all know , the longer the better ) .Rules and Regulations : This one is a bit hard . I am very tempted to say a Britten/Auden cabaret song , but am I just being too much persuaded by the boys ' school eroticism of the film clip ? Mind you there is the witty text and rhymes and the badly played recorder like we hear in Britten 's Noye 's Fludde ... ..Not ready to Love : Ravel . Not the busy whirly Ravel but the minimalisty piano concerto second movement Ravel.Slide Show : This one is hard . There are elements of Schumann- the delicacy of the melody and the emotion , the soaring phrases ( which are also a little bit Leonora from Il Trovatre do n't you think ? ) and the melancholy play out . But what about the crazy Bruckner brass burst ? Tulsa : A mad Piazzolla/Mahler mix.Leaving for Paris : Very Satie . Does n't go anywhere , but if you are in the mood it 's a nice journey anywhere . Actually , I enjoy it far more than Satie but you get my drift.San souci : It 's not really very classical is it ? However is there not a hint of Zanzibar from Poulenc 's Les Mamelles des Tiresias ?

Highly recommended ; definately on my top-ten list this year !"}, "25100": {"id": "25099", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Selling Insincerity is the debut album of Abigail 's Ghost , a young American band formed around the nucleus of guitarist and vocalist Joshua Theriot and bassist Kenneth Wilson . Though the band avoids categorization , their style of music mostly falls into progressive rock that emphasizes a blend of groove , spacey atmospheres , and excellent vocal harmonies.This is a self-released effort , drawing from a vast library of influences including Porcupine Tree , A Perfect Circle , Tool , Massive Attack , and Rush . The low bass drones of the album opener `` Mazurka '' lead into the rhythmically aware `` Close '' , which immediately stands out for its Porcupine Tree-like vocal arrangement , sparse drum beats , and bleak synth lines . The chorus of the song is incredibly memorable , and helps thicken the already dense soundscape . You can hear lots of weird sound collections in the background if you listen with a good set of headphones . The song breaks down into a creepy middle section filled with cold acoustic guitars capped by powerful bass strokes and distant keyboards.Joshua Theriot employs a similar vocal recording technique to Steven Wilson ; he utilises the same processed vocal style and laidback singing whilst continuously exerting a melodious delivery . His vocal melodies on songs like `` Waiting Room '' and `` Seeping '' are amazing . Though most will be reminded of Steven Wilson when hearing him sing , Theriot cites Chris Corner of IAMX and Sneaker Pimps as his main influence . He is also an excellent guitar player , adding varied guitar sounds to the compositions . He can go from elegiac lead playing on `` Monochrome '' to atonal expressions on `` Love Sounds '' and `` Cerulean Blue '' , both of which boast a Belew-like tone and articulation.Kenneth Wilson 's backing vocals and bass are equally important to the success of these songs . Not only is he a gifted songwriter , he is also an excellent producer given the duo 's limited resources when recording this album . If it were n't for the amazing production , there is no way these songs would sound as good as they do . Wilson 's bass playing is particularly central on `` Cerulean Blue '' , complete with industrial-like beats , eerie sounds , and manipulated vocal parts . The mix on this song is phenomenal , blowing the listener away with killer right-left speaker panning.The other members ' performance is awesome as well . The studio drummer did a great job , as he exerts both classic 4/4 beats and complex polyrhythms depending on the flow of the song ( he is now replaced by permanent member John Patrick Rodrigue ) . They have also enlisted a second guitar player since they cut the record : Randy Paul . However , Joshua Theriot 's guitar work is solid through and through with crunchy rhythms and excellent leads . Theriot has also recorded some synths along with keyboardist Brett Guillory who brings in Barbieri-like synth textures in order to reach necessary atmospheres.The lyrics are thought-provoking and match the incredible artwork perfectly . The image on the front cover gives a sense of separation while the baby doll lying on the ground in the foreground has ties to themes of abandonment , which is explored on the album . Also , `` Sellout '' could be read as a nod to Porcupine Tree 's `` The Sound of Muzak '' , but it is also about compromising oneself . The band is n't that keen on talking about their lyrics as they believe it might defeat the purpose of extrapolating one 's own meaning.Fans who enjoy progressive music that marries the hallmarks of Porcupine Tree 's modern-sounding material with the harmonies of Cure and A Perfect Circle should check this disc out .

I ca n't recommend Peter Mew 's overuse of No Noise for this album but the great music on it manages to transcend most of the issues with the mastering . Some people will find this difficult to listen to others wo n't mind it . It really depends on your ear and your system . Five stars for the album ... 2 stars for the mastering.It 's too bad this album did n't find an appreciative audience because `` Boulders '' is a masterpiece . Covering everything from his unique version of `` gospel '' ( `` Songs of Praise '' ) to folk ballads tinged with psychedelia , Wood 's music was always unique and demanding of his audience . The founder of The Move and co-founder of ELO with Jeff Lynne ( Wood left due to creative differences during the recording of ELO 's second album ) . Goofy , fun , delightfully creative and charming ( in a good way ) '' Boulders '' remains , along with `` Mustard '' , Wood 's masterpiece . Wood plays every instrument here ( except one ) and does all the vocals himself . Wood takes unexpected twists and turns from using the sound of slapped water as percussion to the humorous `` When Gran'ma Plays the Banjo '' where Wood plays the banjo impersonating the Gran'ma of the title and other**less talented**players.The booklet has the song lyrics and an appreciation of sorts by Wood himself discussing the album . We only get a single bonus track an early rough mix of `` Dear Elaine '' but the album would have been welcome without anything extra . It 's that good.Recorded in 1969 while Wood was still leading The Move and before he formed ELO with Lynne , the album was held three years after its completion so as not to conflict with Wood 's other output . It 's a pity because if this had been released in 1970 instead of 1973 I do n't doubt that Wood 's unique , stylizied delivery would have found an audience . He manages to take his hook filled music and twist it in ways only his peers and influences could have.If you 've heard `` California Man '' you 'll have an idea of the `` sound '' of the album . The last Move album sounds a lot like `` Boulders '' . Wood 's sound and approach wo n't be for everyone and anyone listening to this because of Wood 's brief affilation with ELO will be surprised because this sounds NOTHING like what Jeff Lynne later did with that band .

I love the fact that Mustaine is making a serious effort to return to his 80 's thrash roots . For the most part the album is pure heavy metal and avoids the progressive sound they had from the mid to late 90's.There are numerous strengths for this album . The production is great and the band plays suprisingly tight for not having been together long . Glen Drover is a fantastic lead guitarist . Shawn Drover is no Gar Samuelson or Nick Menza , but he holds his own well enough on drums . There are no really bad songs on this album and the remake of A Toute Le Monde is surprisingly good ... normally I do n't like those lightweight songs but that one has really grown on me.There are not many weaknesses to this album but they should be noted . I would say one of the main weaknesses to me is a lack of a `` classic '' track , such as Peace Sells or Hangar 18 . There are some very good songs on this album such as Sleepwalker and Gears of War but I would not put those songs in the same category as My Last Words or Tornado of Souls . Also , there is a lack of very speedy songs . Most songs are heavy , but the album is mostly mid-paced . I am a fan of the 80 's Deth sound so sometimes I want them to really go balls out but it usually does not happen here . Another problem is that the album is a little too political , even by Mustaine 's standards . Some of these songs are too centered around current events and will probably sound dated in ten years . When he does political songs it would be smarter to keep them more abstract , such as Peace Sells or Holy Wars.I do not want to sound too negative though , this is a strong album , some of the best metal to come out this year .

Junior is long gone folks . Love him or hate him , Dave deserves respect for all he has done for metal . His contributions are enormous . I am a guitar player and guitar freak anyway , so when I buy or listen to a Megadeth album , to me it 's all about the guitar work . This is what Dave does best , his singing is secondary . Dave does NOT disappoint on United Abominations . His chops , riffs , and solos are as top notch as ever . He still dominates the fretboard . So there was no disappointment there.Dave 's voice is the same as it has always been . Great singer ? No . But he never was anyway . Dave 's voice is just a tool to deliver the message , that 's it . This album is chock full of warfare , corruption , and the Apocalypse ( it 's Megadeth , what did you expect ? ) . I really dig the vibe and atmosphere on the song `` Blessed are the Dead '' as he presented his vision of the Four Horsemen.I do like this album . But after you listen to it , no songs really stand out . You listen to the whole album and remember very little of it . There is just no big impact . With The System has Failed I could stand in line at the chowhall and sing 'Kick the Chair ' to myself , but United Abominations has no anthems so to speak.Again I 've only had this album for two days , but I can already tell that this album will take time to grow on me . I 'll probably appreciate it more if I can find some guitar tabulature for it . And one more thing , thank God Dave is still carrying the torch of REAL metal . This IS a REAL metal album . It is not fair , but Megadeth released a decent album on Roadrunner records and it will probably sell 200,000 units worldwide . Meanwhile Metallica is getting ready to release another abortion of an album this year that sheep will buy and it will go platinum , go figure . But most metalheads see that Metallica can not compete with Megadeth anymore . Metallica ruled the 80 's , but life is a marathon , and Megadeth is WAY out in front while Metallica is deciding on how to record St. Anger II without a therapist ."}, "25118": {"id": "25117", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 've been waiting for this album to come out since about 2 months ago .

Despite that is the 21st century , Megadeth still remained heavy as hell on their new album . this is amazing . `` Sleepwalkers '' was a great opener . `` Washington is next '' is an awesome politically inspired song that rocks real hard .

'' There is a huge European metal sound on this record ( loads of twin lead guitars , a zillion musical time changes ) that can be partially attributed to Glen Drover joining the band ( he 's a former King Diamond guitarist . ) Megadeth has always had elements of that in their music , but rarely this dedicated over an entire album.Adding to this sound is Drover 's brother Shawn on drums . He plays with Neil Peart-precision and bulldozer power , providing serious musical muscle . Production-wise , It 's their best-sounding studio release by far.That 's not to take away from any of the previous Megadeth lineups , but in the past they had a jazzier , breezier sound which was unique , but not always heavy . `` Abominations '' is just full-on complex Euro-thrash without the glass-shattering banshee vocals.Unlike many recent Megadeth records ( which I like ) `` Abominations '' is beautifully inaccessible . You need to listen to it several times before it truly sinks in , but it rewards a patient ear.The lyrics and themes on this disc are mostly about today 's politically chaotic mess of a planet , which I think brings the best out in Dave . He 's a genius when he 's angry and focused . Many of his legendary songs are current events-related ( `` Holy Wars '' , `` Symphony of Destruction '' and `` Set The World Afire '' to name a few . ) `` Abominations '' fits right into that club.It does quiet down a bit for the remake of `` A Tout le Monde '' ( a duet with Lacuna Coil 's Cristina Scabbia ) but the rest sounds like truckload of 2x4s being fed into a giant table saw . `` Sleepwalker '' , `` Washington is Next ! `` , and `` Never Walk Alone ... A Call to Arms '' , is as powerful an album-opening 1-2-3 punch as any in the band 's catalog.This is n't just a return to form for Megadeth , it 's something heavier with a great big nod to the classic Euro-metal bands of the 80 's ."}, "25123": {"id": "25122", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Megadeth continue their return to form started with THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED . the 2nd trilogy is worth owning , THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED , UNITED ABOMINATIONS and ENDGAME.Sounds like a return to the glory days for Mr. Mustaine and co.

I personally love it when a band does something that no one expects out of them . And , not only does LP do that , they do it so good they make you forget that you even disliked the new sound.The album itself is not a far departure from the rap/pop/alternative infusion that made the band successfyl . It is the result of what ahppens when a band pushes themselves . I think that the album drips with personality , heart , and emotions.The band does get political , and at times a bit lovestruck . But , what the band does not do is depart entirely from their edge and sharpness . Chester 's voice still pierces the heart , and oozes with emotion . The basslines take hold . Shinoda 's vocals and lyrics take you to where he was when he got the inspiration for the song . It 's a full fledged , heavily worked on album.The only downside is that the album falls short in the productiond epartment . While the lyircs and overall effect of the songs still fills the listener with emotion . The way the album was put together seems a litle haphazard .

But , it is the major critique I have for it.in essences , I appluad the band for striving to do something different .

In fact , I was surprised when they released `` Numb '' and `` Breaking the Habit '' because I forgot those songs were even on there . Anyway , I can tell right away that their latest album Minutes to Midnight is great.A lot of reviewers seem to dislike this album for two reasons : 1 ) there are too many slower songs on here , and 2 ) Mike does n't rap very much on here . For the former , I think reviewer M. Smith said it best when s/he suggested that core fans of the band need to stop living in the past ; I mean , it would be different if the entire album was ballad-y . And it 's not like Chester 's vocals sound any different . For the latter , I kinda wanted to hear Mike rapping a little more too , but then I remembered that that 's not that important because he 's also the rhythm guitarist/keyboardist , so he decided to focus more on THOSE things . If he were a hype man ONLY , it would be a different story.Anyway , lead single `` What I 've Done '' is easily the best song . Also good are `` Leave Out All the Rest '' as well as the romantic three-in-a-row : `` Valentine 's Day '' , `` In Between '' and `` In Pieces '' . And `` Bleed It Out '' is a highlight as well ( especially that Saturday Night Live performance ) , but the only thing about it is , well , it 's the second single off the album , and it sounds a little too much like the second single from their LAST album , `` Faint '' ( but on the positive side , Mike 's rap is a little better on this song than on the former ) .If there are any songs that I can do without , they would be `` Give It Up '' and `` No More Sorrow '' , because they sound too wannabe metal .

In the past five hours I 've listened to this record none stop , and I still can not get enough .

Leave Out All The Rest , a slower song but Chester 's voice is just amazing in the song and the music is just so relaxing ... this song will grow on you , just give it a few chances . It would make a great single . Bleed It Out , one of the two songs that mike raps on , his rapping skills are amazing , it 's a very upbeat song and would make a great single as well . What I 've Done , you 've heard it , love it or hate it , I 've always loved this song . Hands Held High , a song obviously about the bush administration and if you read the lyrics they actually say some pretty humorous stuff about bush . No More Sorrow , another really heavy song and will make older linkin park fans happy . Valentines Day , great ballad that explodes into a very heavy song and is very emotional and great . Probably a lot of people will be able to relate to it . In Pieces , the song I was looking forward to the most . It has really different drumming , ska/clash-like guitars and also a great guitar solo in it . One of the best songs on the whole record . The Little Things Give You Away , amazing song and has the solo that every linkin park fan has been waiting for and its very beautiful and the whole song is just great.Agree or Disagree , I think this record is amazing and if you give it a few listens I 'm sure you 'll fall in love with it .

This is not the same Linkin Park who wrote `` One Step Closer '' ( a great song in its own right ) back in 2000 . No longer are these guys screaming `` shut up when I 'm talking to you ! ! ! '' while playing all power chords on the guitar . To listeners , this can be a good or a bad thing ; good to those who expect to see a little change and growth over the years , bad to those who enjoy hearing the same music and lyrics over and over again . Those of you looking for `` Hybrid Theory Part II '' or `` Meteora the Second '' will be very disappointed here . I 'll admit , I love LP 's first two major releases and still listen to them on a regular basis . But `` Minutes to Midnight '' is a horse of an entirely different color.Gone are the days of seamless interplay between Chester 's clean and/or screamed vocals and Mike 's raps in each song . As others before me have said , Chester handles about 80 % of the vocal duties on this album . But is that really such a bad thing ? The man has a phenomenal voice ! Sure , the scratching effects of one Mr. Hahn are almost absent here , but his presence can still be felt in the other electronic sounds pervasive throughout the album . What really impresses me , however , is how much the other three members of the band have stepped it up in regards to their instruments . Guitarist Brad Delson , for the most part , ditches the all-power chord playing that characterized LP 's first 2 albums in favor of something more clean and textured , and he even plays a couple solos ! The power behind Rob Bourdon 's drumming has intensified , particularly evident on `` No More Sorrow . '' And bassist Phoenix ? You can actually HEAR the man playing this time , most clearly on `` Given Up . `` Now I 'll admit , I was rather disappointed at first when I heard the two `` political '' songs on this album , `` Hands Held High '' and `` No More Sorrow , '' both of which clearly are pointed jabs at the Bush administration . The reason for my disappointment is that Linkin Park has made such great music in the past without having to resort to politics , so why start now ? I 'm no fan of Bush or the Iraq war , but I see no need for musicians to bring their views into their songs . ( I know many of you will disagree with me , and that 's fine , but keep your thoughts to yourself . You are n't winning The Battle for the Internets by posting comments on my review . ) That being said , these guys have done this a lot better than most other artists recently have , i.e . The Dixie Chicks and Green Day . LP 's political songs actually have a little thing called `` emotion '' behind them , and they do n't sound whiny or forced . ( See `` Not Ready to Make Nice '' or `` American Idiot '' for examples of this . ) Furthermore , yes , the F-bomb is utilized on three songs on this release ( `` Given Up , '' `` Bleed It Out , '' `` Hands Held High '' ) , and while I am shocked by that it fails to detract from the overall quality of the songs.I 'm now going to delve into a track-by-track review of the album:1 ) `` Wake '' -Just a short instrumental intro , barely a minute long . Perfectly sets the 50/50 `` beautiful '' and `` brutal '' tone of the album.2 ) `` Given Up '' -Linkin Park gone punk rock ? No way , it ca n't work ! But it does , and Chester 's voice is in top form here . The hand claps and jingling keys are unique background sounds , and Phoenix 's bass playing is killer . Also marks the first apperance of the F-bomb on the album.3 ) `` Leave Out All The Rest '' -The first real `` ballad '' on `` Minutes to Midnight , '' but it 's a great one . Chester sings this one beautifully and the lyrics are quite meaningful.4 ) `` Bleed It Out '' -Far and away the most fun song on the album to listen to . This is Mike 's first appearance and he does not disappoint . He proves that he is more talented than about 95 % of mainstream rappers today . Second track with the F-bomb.5 ) `` Shadow of the Day '' -A lot of folks have compared this to the U2 hit `` With or Without You , '' and I can see why . Was the band channeling Bono and Company while writing/recording this one ? Who knows , but it sounds good to me.6 ) `` What I 've Done '' -The album 's first single that you 've no doubt heard countless times on your local radio station ( s ) . Excellent choice for a single , but I personally would have picked `` Bleed It Out . `` 7 ) `` Hands Held High '' -This track is all Mike . Very reminiscent of his Fort Minor side project , but you can still tell it 's LP . I 'd love to hear this one at a live show.8 ) `` No More Sorrow '' -Chester 's turn to get political on us , and boy does he sound angry . And as a couple others have said , this song would n't sound out of place on a Metallica release . Rob 's drumming is extraordinary here.9 ) `` Valentine 's Day '' -Probably the most `` emo '' song on the album , but LP are n't trying to sound like Dashboard Confessional . And thank God for that . Starts out slow but picks up toward the end.10 ) `` In Between '' -Hold on , Mike can sing ? Who knew ? This is probably the slowest and most simple song on the album , but that does n't make it bad by any means.11 ) `` In Pieces '' -This might sound like an odd comparison , but this track reminds me a lot of the song `` 37 mm '' from AFI 's newest release `` Decemberunderground . '' More on my proposed Linkin Park-AFI connection a bit later.12 ) `` The Little Things Give You Away '' -Honestly , I cried the first time I heard this song . It 's that beautiful , and the perfect closer . I never thought LP had it in them to write a song about Hurricane Katrina , but it works.Okay , now onto why I 'm suggesting that Linkin Park and A Fire Inside ( AFI ) are similar . To be sure , they are two very different sounding bands , but they both took critical risks with recent releases that appear to have `` alienated '' many of their `` hardcore fans . '' AFI did it in 2003 with `` Sing The Sorrow '' and even more so with 2006 's `` Decemberunderground . '' These two albums were so dramatically different from anything they 've done previously that much of their `` fanbase '' wrote them off as `` sell-outs '' because they all wanted `` The Art of Drowning Part Deux . '' It is evident to me that the same thing is happening here with Linkin Park . `` Minutes to Midnight '' is unmistakeably different from any previous LP release , and it shows real growth and promise , but apparently there are still a ton of folks out there who are stuck in the year 2000 and are waiting for another song like `` Crawling '' or `` Runaway '' to come out of LP 's repertoire . Their loss I suppose ."}, "25151": {"id": "25150", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This has great tracks , so what if its not `` heavy '' as the previous ones .

Whilst the previous album Meteora was and is always going to be their best work , they have seen that creating a sound that is repetitious and the same would in time kill their fame . Like it or not , things change , people do and so do bands . Without change we would n't have the best that the music industry offers day in and day out . 'Minutes To Midnight ' is a album of shared personal experience on the tour road and their own personal touches . The back artcover of the album simply is astonishing and proves the point that the five are looking out into the ocean , to see what a 'tomorrow ' will bring . True , I will agree with some reviewers that some of the songs in this album sound like ballads . However , I am a fan of lyrics and the lyrics in these songs are meaningful.The songs that are my favourites and are played religiously are 'Shadow Of The Day ' , 'What 've I Done ' , 'In Between ' and 'Bleed It Out ' . I for one have enjoyed the more mellow music of Linkin Park that for me show more of a experimentation and has made me get closer to this band . Sure , you should maybe listen 2 or 3 times to this album before you start appreciating it , as I have.Overall Linkin Park should be applauded for experimenting and letting go with new sounds . Their next album will be that much better for this experimentation ."}, "25153": {"id": "25152", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I was among the many who were disappointed by Linkin Park 's new release upon hearing their CD was not composed and arranged in the manner the last two were , especially since the TRANSFORMERS anthem , `` What I 've Done '' , gave everyone the impression that it was exactly that . But , you know what they say about assumptions . Granted , when I listened to the 30 second clips available on Amazon.com I was disappointed.Linkin Park had fallen into the rut that define most Modern Nu-Metal , Progressive , and Hark Rock bands of the mainstream industry popularized by brooding teens , head-bangers , and casual listeners alike ( I honestly still think of this CD in that manner ) . And to top it all off , the decision to include profanity in their lyrics just felt like a major 180 and totally unnecessary in my opinion.Which is not to say I was offended , no , I simply thought Profanity never worked with Linkin Park like it does for RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE -- to name a band who uses profanity in their lyrics -- , especially when they could their point across or entertain the masses without it . Nevertheless , I decided I would not buy `` Minutes to Midnight '' and simply stick with the Ghost of Linkin Park 's past ; I.E. , `` What I 've Done '' and the previous releases . But then I forgot about on important and flawed detail about LP . Their songs are far too short and get boring easily after a hundredth listening.So upon hearing `` Shadow of the Day '' on the radio , I downloaded the CD and gave it a listening to . Sufficed to say , I was surprised by what assaulted my ears . MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT is not as horrible as I thought it would be , I was wrong in thinking I was buying another `` Fallen ( Evanescence ) '' that would forever haunt me as the biggest Musical Purchase Mistake of my life.No , what I found here still sounds like Linkin Park , only this time it lacks the anger of Chester Bennington 's sore-throat screaming , Mr. Hahn 's Scratch-Table and Electronic beats ( with the exception of a couple songs ) , and the constant presence Mike Shinoda 's old school rapping ( with the exception of one or two songs ) . To put simply Chester Bennington tries his hand at singing on a softer level and to his credit , it works in most of the songs on MTM and then sometimes it does n't mesh at all . The songs are softer and carry a more emotional impact ( the underline themes catering on Regret , Loss , and Reflection ) than the first two.And in one track Mike Shinoda attempts to `` sing '' Microphone confession style ( that 's what it reminded me of ) , a song which has very little instrumental , and it does n't suit him . He should stick to Rapping . And ironically , if you listen to this entire CD , `` What I 've Done '' suddenly improves as a song , especially with the way `` Shadow of the Day '' ends and connects the strange Distorted Sound Affect at the beginning of the song . The strength suddenly returns to the song because it is complemented by the others surrounding it . Ironically , I 'm not even sure why this CD got a parental Advisory Warning Label . The F***Bomb is only used a couple of times in two songs if memory serves me right . After that the profanity is hardly existent on the CD . I 'm not even sure what the ruckus was about anymore , aside from over exaggerated reactions.It honestly reminds me of this : [ `` Mothers rally against Barbie with nose piercing or Butterfly tattoo on her leg , back , or stomach ... whichever it was ... '' ] [ Track Listing ] :1 . Wake - 4/52 . Given Up - 4/53 . Leave Out All The Rest - 5/54 . Bleed It Out - 4/55 . Shadow Of The Day - 4/56 . What I 've Done - 5/57 . Hands Held High - 3/58 . No More Sorrow - 3/59 . Valentine 's Day - 4/510 . In Between - 3/511 . In Pieces - 4/512 . The Little Things Give You Away - 5/5Overall , MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT is a great CD from Linkin Park and unfortunately , like TRANSFORMERS - THE ALBUM , it shall forever be looked down upon as `` Disappointing '' because it lacked what people wanted or expected of them ( for TRANSFORMERS , it was the score . The Score , which had yet to come out and thus people sought to degrade the CD and complain like children about the score not being available instead of keeping that venom to themselves . For Linkin Park : The Original Sound of their previous CDs lacking in `` Minutes to Midnight '' ) .

They 're trying to leave behind the Nu Metal genre that has pretty much fizzled out . Without this move , they probably would n't be around much longer . Luckily , they did the smart thing and expanded their sound . Does it sound different ? Yes . Is it still Linkin Park ? Yes . I remember reading that Mike would n't be rapping much , and I was disappointed at first . But the album 's depth really makes up for that . The songs sucked me in to the point that I almost forgot about the absence of rapping verses . They 're that good . Sure , there are softer songs . But they 're executed perfectly . Not to mention , the few heavy songs on here are , in my opinion , heavier than anything else the band has done . Finally we get to hear true hard rock songs without that overly produced distorted guitar . We also get to hear acoustic songs on this album . I would also like to say that Mike 's presence is not missing ! He co-produced the album , plays most of the rhythm guitar so that Brad can finally play some lead , contributes 2 great raps , and actually sings one song all on his own ( which he does amazingly , I might add ... kinda reminds me of a deeper version of Ben Gibbard 's voice.. ) Look , if you only like bands like Evanescence , Breaking Benjamin , etc etc ( Do n't get me wrong , I love those bands ) then this album probably is n't for you .

Too bad those people are idiots who are narrow minded and ca n't stand when a band `` sells out '' . Minutes to Midnight is their best album to date . It is perhaps probably one of the best albums I have ever bought , and I was n't even expecting to like it as much.When I first found out about Linkin Park a few years ago , I dug their older albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora , and some stuff I heard from this album . But , a few months later , I went back to listening to Christian Rock music . Months later , I was back into secular music and I heard some more songs from Linkin Park and other bands . A few months after that , I had bought both Meteora and Hybrid Theory and liked them . But , they wore out on me pretty quickly , and I discovered that a band evolving is much better than a band staying the same . So I picked up this album just a few days prior to me writing this review , and I enjoyed this record.While they have changed from Meteora 's nu-metal sound to a more alternative sound and do that sound justice , most of the hard-rocking stuff falls completely flat . I find these tracks to be throwaway tracks , Given Up especially . I am sorry fans , but nothing about this song sticks out at all , and just appears to be tired and worn out . On top of all of those issues , the F-bomb is thrown around in this song like a Frisbee , and all of us know about the 18-second scream that comes off as annoying . It 's a good way to start off an album , but honestly , it 's just a throwaway track like I said . Amongst the softer songs , the only song I find to be just decent is In Between . In this song , Mike ( the emcee ) takes over the vocal tracks . While his voice is good , it 's not really as good as Chester 's voice.The softer songs on here do show us what this band has to offer on the `` alternative '' side . These songs are Leave Out All The Rest , Shadow Of The Day , What I 've Done , Valentine 's Day , In Pieces , and The Little Things Give You Away . Leave Out All The Rest is my favorite track on this album . The music is well done on this song , the lyrics are great , and Chester 's vocals on this particular song totally beat the vocals on songs such as Do n't Stay , One Step Closer , Somewhere I Belong , From the Inside , Points of Authority , any other song that they have possibly recorded . A lead singer in a band seriously ca n't be screaming , `` Shut up when I 'm talking to you ! '' or , `` The very worst part of you ... IS ME ! '' for seven years , or at this rate , twelve years of his life . On top of that , the other band members ca n't showcase their aggressive side for that long either.So , this is all I have to say about the particular album . As usual , fans are not worthy enough to give this album even one benefit , as they are all narrow minded . Like I said , a band ca n't showcase their older sound for every single record they record . It gets bothersome to people who are actually willing to see this band grow as musicians and as people . Limp Bizkit has also gotten this kick-in-the-behind by their older fans when their 2003 album Results May Vary was released . Another band that has also gotten this criticism is A Fire Inside ( AFI ) . I read Nate McCooey 's review of this album and he mentioned the same band . Seriously , America , when are we going to stop being this stupid ? Oh well , it does n't matter anyway . This album is totally a perfect addition for your collection.TRACKS : Given Up ( 1.5/5 ) Leave Out All The Rest ( 5/5 ) Bleed It Out ( 3.5/5 ) Shadow Of The Day ( 5/5 ) What I 've Done ( 5/5 ) Hands Held High ( 3.5/5 ) No More Sorrow ( 3/5 ) Valentine 's Day ( 4.5/5 ) In Between ( 3/5 ) In Pieces ( 5/5 ) The Little Things Give You Away ( 4.5/5 ) ALBUM SCORE : ( 43/55 ) Rating : 5 stars/5 stars"}, "25158": {"id": "25157", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Having worked in a record store , Linkin Park was like nails on a chalkboard for everyone there . The kids liked them , but every employee there thought they sucked royally . Cut to seeing Transformers this Summer , and the closing credits played over `` What I 've Done '' finally brought me in to check them out . Bringing producer Rick Rubin in was the best move the band could have made . Gone are the lame white-boy raps , and fake techno beats , instead concentrating on a more definitive rock approach , which at this point in their career has redefined their sound , instead of stagnating like Limp Bizkit or Korn have done .

But as someone who listens to large quantities of music from mainstream to indie , I contend that no one has mastered the art of rap-rock like they have ( Quarashi is the only band I can think of that even belongs in the same neighborhood ) . There 's an almost mathematical perfection to both Hybrid Theory and Meteora , their first two full , non-remix albums . Ultimately , Linkin Park has offered something that I could n't find anywhere else.I 'm not one to say that bands should n't change and mature . But , honestly , I did n't want to see Linkin Park change , because they 're already unique . They have changed in Minutes to Midnight , and the metamorphosis is n't a positive one.Upon a first listen , two things are glaring:1 ) Mike Shinoda 's rapping presence is minimal . I 've always preferred Chester 's raspy vocals to Shinoda 's rapping , but he 's so underutilized on this album that you realize that he 's an integral part to the Linkin Park sound . The fusion of his rapping and Chester 's vocals combined with excellent beats and melodies makes the band.2 ) There are a lot of songs that almost qualify as ballads . The good news is , most of them are pretty pleasant . Chester really does have a great voice- even when he is n't screaming and rasping . The bad news is that they take up slots on the album that I wanted to see filled with the rap-rock-electronica-metal that immediately entranced me on Hybrid Theory and Meteora.Undoubtedly , this album is the type that grows each time you play it , but it simply does n't do what fans of the band wanted it to do . There are a few hints of where the band has been . Stand-outs What I 've Done , Bleed It Out , Given Up , and No More Sorrow all convince me that this may actually be Linkin Park and not some evil clone band from Mars.Again , the album is n't bad- I enjoyed it even on the first listen , but most of it does n't really do anything to distinguish itself from the type of alt-rock that you can find almost anywhere . 3.5 STARS"}, "25160": {"id": "25159", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Seen them several times in the great city of Seattle , it was not until this album that the band finally clicked for me .

Boondox captured the legendary monster and wrapped the beast up into an amazing track . If Pumpkinhead could have written a song and rapped about where he came from , it would sound similar to this . `` Sleep Stalker '' is along the same lines as ICP 's `` Sleep Walker '' , in it Boondox does n't want to go to sleep because he wakes up to murder scenes and has the same problem as Violent J did where every time he falls asleep or closes his eyes somebody dies . Violent J comes in on the chorus for this track . `` Southern Nights '' took a few listens but it 's another cool track , there 's a really good dueling harmonica and sliding guitar break in this song that 's awesome and Violent J 's all over this track . `` Suffering '' is another great track , it has the same feel as `` She 's in the River '' from The Harvest . In the song Boondox has a love interest and keeps her close by , torturing and making her suffer before she ultimately meets her untimely death , I must say Boondox comes off as quite the lady 's man on these types of tracks.REMIXES '' They Pray With Snakes '' & `` Seven '' - I cant say enough about these remixes , they 're remixes of tracks that are already great , some may look at the song list and see these tracks as filler tracks for the cd , but no , these remixes are amazing just like the rest of the entire Punkinhed EP , they 're not to be overlooked because they complete the album and go over nice with the EP as a whole.Overall , Boondox 's Punkinhed EP is extremely dark and wicked.Pumpkinhead himself would have to give Boondox props for the justice he gave to this legendary monster ."}, "25163": {"id": "25162", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Listening to Yolanda has always been a delight .

Less distorions , less electronic sounds , more hard guitar , more real instruments or real instrument samples.The band made over 100 starts of music for this CD , and chose these . Every song is well mastered . I respect an artists ' choices of expression , and realize that people are not static -- they grow , change , learn , age and evolve . This is a perfect evolution . No jumping from monkeys to humans here , its easy to see how they got to this place . They said they intentionally tried to abandon everything that was `` comfortable , easy and they 'd done before '' . That 's clear.Its clear here that LP has done what they wanted to do , and not what they `` thought they should do '' . Yet they prove that they can still be what they were ( track 2 , example ) , and chose not to be that . Bands typically take one of two routes -- replicating exactly what they 've done to make more cash , or doing what they feel , to be a real artistic group . They are being real artists here.I feel influences here that I have n't heard before -- Metallica , U2 , Coldplay a bit , some NIN like beats in one spot , a small Blue October feel with some more calm introspective stuff that I have n't quite identified yet . It 's all good . No bubble gum pop , no 80 's hair band stuff . Some incredibly hard stuff , some very revealing stuff.I found myself liking the stuff that was most atypical because its like getting to see the other side of someone you feel like you know well . Deeper , different , and thought provoking.In this CD Chester is more able to do his thing . Shinoda is more able to do his thing as well . Shinoda is n't limited to his 5 second hip hop responses to Chester 's chrous . That 's refreshing that each gets full time to do his respective thing.It was said that each member of the band contributed just as much as the others during the process of development of tracks , where previously it would be the Shinoda & Chester . It 's clear that others had more input.I 'd almost say this CD could be considered a `` Prequel '' . I think had the band had the full freedom to do what they wanted , their first CD may have sounded like this.There is a marked uptick in the curse factor . I know how difficult it is to refrain from that , and with the first two instances I smiled and chuckled , becuase I had a great feeling of release for them . Be real and let it all out ... I have only had it one day , so I 'm refraining from making an outright `` AWESOME ! '' . It definitely does n't suck , I would n't even call it mediocre . It 's good . I just do n't know if I 've had enough time to discover how good it is.I do n't like artists who sound exactly the same on every album . Those are the ones who get a single play , and get put away . I do n't expect people to not evolve . Its like going back to your home town and expecting your old friends to be who they were `` back then '' . `` Back then '' is n't anymore.The packaging : Very _very_ nice book looking booklet with the DVD of PCM audio , interactive stuff for the PC including MP3 's so you do n't have to extract . Images , PDF of the album book internals . More.I always buy every LP CD , because I respect them as a group . They do their own artwork , and I really appreciate that as well . I take it in as their conveying an artistic message . I listen , chew it up , think about it.If you are one who listens to the words , you will definitely not be disappointed here . Lyrically , as good as ever . [ edit in , a couple days later ] I ca n't put the CD down . I am really liking it , a LOT . If I could change the 4 star to a 5 , I would do so . I think a lot of people who have been reviewing the standard CD could really benefit from the video on the DVD about the making of the CD . It really makes it all make sense.The only additional comment , is that I still really like the new totally different introspective slower tracks . I also really like stuff like track 2 . I wish they would have released a dual disc set here -- one CD of hard hard stuff , a CD of the introspective slower quieter stuff . That way , instead of a roller coaster of emotions , you can `` get it out '' whether you 're feeling the need to rock , or to chill.I want more of those 100 , soon . I feel like I want to encourage them to really push the fringes with the house beats on a couple tracks , the slow almost beatless tracks , and the industrial beat/80 's Police style beats mixed 50/50 .

Initially my delay was created by attempting to decide between the Liceu performance and this one ; obviously I opted for the Russian/French performance.That most of us know this work at all is due to its revival at Pesaro and subsequent recording on DGG . In a sense it `` disappeared '' for the greater part of a century and even though Rossini co-opted much of the music of Viaggio for Le Conte Ory , that work had few performances until after WWII . The recording set a very high standard of Rossini singing . Would that there have been cameras present to memorialize the production . It is truly amazing to think that Russia would be able to gather a group of attractive singers who could grasp the style of early 19th century Rossini and for the most part compete with singers from Western Europe who would be more at home with this period . Obviously vocal pedagogy has moved in Russia to a more inclusive embrace of western styles . None of the singers with one exception , have had a presence in houses outside of Russia , the one exception being Danill Shtoda . It should be added that the group of singers assembled for the Liceu production are hardly more `` starry '' or international than what we have at the Chatelet but I gather that neither the production nor the singing can compete with this Opus Arte set.It would be wonderful if a production could be mounted with the likes Juan Diego Florz , DiDonato , et . al , but finanial constraints being what they are it is hardly likely .

They do n't . i really like Panic and i like some of Fall Out Boy 's songs but i do n't like this album . i 'm not sure who they sound like .

They 're an influential Swedish black metal quartet that has been terrorizing the neighborhood since the early Nineties with overtly Satanic subject matter , vile vocals , blazing tempos , blistering guitars , and , most famously , breakneck drumming . With that said , do not be too quick to assume that you already know what to expect from their tenth and newest full-length . Marduk 's same basic sound may be the same , but `` Rom 5:12 '' also varies the formula a bit by adding a good fair amount of undeniable nuance , depth , tempo variation , and more intelligent , developed songwriting and sophisticated song structures.There are ten songs presented on this album , and exactly half of them find Marduk stepping outside of their comfort zone and expanding their horizons significantly with new ( and dare I say `` experimental ? '' ) ideas . The first of which , `` The Levelling Dust , '' boasts a good , juicy , mid-tempo , and even quite catchy thrash riff , deft , thumping drums , and extremely vile and acidic vocals from Mortuus , making it a strong opener . Track three , `` Imago Mortis , '' slows the album 's pace down considerably with a basic drum beat , slow , slithering , groove-oriented guitar line , and absolutely crawling tempo . Needless to say , it is a terrifically ominous piece , and one that chills the listener to the bone . Next , the brilliant use of a rhythmic , martial drum beat , haunted church-ish organ , and moody , classic-sounding keyboards ( which are simultaneously soothing and mildly unsettling ) make `` 1651 '' equally as dark and spooky . Finally , `` Accuser / Opposer '' and `` Womb of Perishableness '' are also both quite restrained , and are backed by fat , churning , stop-start riffs that drone on and on . The former tune is also of note for its strategically-placed use of atmospheric Latin chants ( at the end ) ; and the latter for its strong , persistent bass line.Fear not , though , longtime fans -- the rest of the material on display here is classic Marduk . `` Cold Mouth Prayer , '' which includes guest vocals from former member Joakim Gothberg , is a ferocious , bludgeoning , rip-roaring statement-of-intent . Its surging , searing , wall-of-sound guitars , and furious , pummeling blast beats should fill doctors ' offices around the world with patients who need a neck brace . `` Through The Belly Of Damnation '' ( which is highlighted by truly mindblowing hyperblasts ) , `` Limbs Of Worship , '' `` Vanity Of Vanities , '' and the closing `` Voices From Avignon '' all follow suit later on by ripping with vengeance and unleashing a murderous , scorched earth attack that is positively skull-crushing . But even these classic Marduk-esque blasters come across as somewhat new and refreshing -- it 's clear that the band are as hungry as ever , and it sounds as if they might even have something to prove . As a result , these songs are quite a bit more memorable than what was heard on earlier albums . `` Rom 5:12 '' is easily Marduk 's best and most expansive , accomplished , varied , original , well-rounded , and memorable effort to date . It is n't exactly a groundbreaking album , but it does rank right alongside 2007 's finest black metal releases ( it 's definitely in the top three ) , and all modern black metal in general . And it sure is n't guaranteed to change the mind of anyone who is n't already a devoted Marduk follower , but all aficionados of the band ( and genre ) will readily eat it up ."}, "25180": {"id": "25179", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "A pleasant listening experience , a very pleasant listening experience .

If those Judeo Bible pushers are right , and this will send me to hell , I 'm proud to back my bags and be on my way.From the moment the album starts to moment it finishes , Rom 5:12 is an assault .

This album pounds and pummels you until you ca n't possibly take anymore , and when it 's over , somehow , you push play again . The songs are fast , intense and have lot 's of depth .

So much so they make up for the 2 previous albums which , if flawed either cohesivesily like World Funeral or sonically like Plague Angel had their very nice moments and enough merit to consider them OK -esp on a live environment like on their terrific Blood Puke Salvation dvd.Following the current trend of inviting former musicians to play on their albums , there are a former drummer and a singer doing additional vocals on some songs . Sound like it would n't work ? Guess again ! It rocks ! Indeed , the drumming harks back to previous Marduk albums although following simpler , sparser , more rock'n roll oriented patterns . Guest vocals are a welcome variation and Mortuus ' vocal style kept developing in the form of aspired effects and his voice is now pleasantly higher in the mix , which he was deserving from their debut with the band . He is no longer coaxed to sound like Legion since either he and Devo now contribute to the lyrics , production and arrangements . Morgan has loosened his grip on the rest of the band and it does show in the general sound and atmosphere of the album.Sonically , it masterfully combines slow and blisteringly fast-paced blastbeat-happy songs -only not abusing either elements- with a lot of a more hardcore-oriented sound , not norsecore , but hardcore-punk.There is a long , brooding intrumental/orchestral interlude with some Arditi dude ? as guest that provides a respite from the sonic carnage and then the aural attack is mercilessly resumed . Plague Angel had one of these as well.The booklet deserves a chapter of its own .

Hitherto , the 1976 version had never appeared on CD.Inclusion of the original 1976 version makes this a particularly welcome reissue because , in my opinion , the 1987 version was significantly weaker than the original , lacking much of the bite of the 1976 production . Originally intended not as the name of a band but , rather , as a one-off exercise , the Alan Parsons Project went on to become one of the most successful and original of prog rock acts , but this is where it all began .

In the case of `` Tales Of Mystery , '' it was Edgar Allan Poe . My original copy of this was on vinyl , a reissue of the 20th Century Records release with a second version of the cover , depicting a bust of Parsons somewhat wrapped in mummy-bandages . ( The long shadow on the CD cover minus the mummy photos was the original cover . ) Featuring several of APP 's soon to be regular cast , collaborator Eric Woolfson and members of the groups Ambrosia ( Parsons produced the debut `` Ambrosia '' ) and Pilot , it was the kind of album that got labeled `` head music '' in the seventies . Perfect for listening to with headphones or while hanging out with friends in a room full of black light posters while probably not 100 % sober.Some 30 years later and more often sober while listening to CD 's , this album holds up well for its first half . The trademarks of APP appear in songs like `` The Raven '' and the instrumental `` Dream Within A Dream . '' There was even a minor hit single as `` The System Of Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather '' slipped into the lower reaches of the top 40 . The album 's final Beatlesque ballad , `` To One In Paradise , '' sounds worthy of Abby Road and is indicative of hits to come - think of `` Time . `` On the other hand , the 15 minute `` The Fall Of The House Of Usher '' is a soundtrack in search of a video accompaniment . While a younger and more - ummm ... - 'stimulated ' imagination might have filled in the picture , it now just sounds like background buzz . While I do n't mind the stentorian narration Parsons added from Orson Welles for the 1987 CD release , the additional synthesizers and solo guitars are an irritant . They could have left well-enough alone , but since CD technology was the shiny new thing at the time , I do n't blame Parsons for wanting to tweak the new version.Now , however , you have both versions in one box . This ups my original rating from 3 stars to four , as the sonic enhancements make the twin discs sound even better . For the first time since a long OOP Mobile Fidelity Disc , you can hear the version of this album in its original context , minus the extra guitars and synths . The demos add little to the package , but the bare narration from Orson Welles ( and the radio spot ) are worth a smile . As soon as I saw this at a domestic price , I knew I 'd have to own it , and it was worth the investment.As far as its place in the APP discography , I probably prefer `` I Robot , '' `` Pyramid '' and `` Eye in the Sky '' ahead of `` Tales Of Mystery .

That 's the first thing you notice.The second thing is the power and precision of his playing . The thirteen-time Grammy winner and premier saxophonist of his generation seems to have lost nothing . Backed by his peers ( Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau , piano ; Pat Metheny , guitar ; John Patitucci , bass ; and Jack DeJohnette , drums ) , playing nine attractive new self-penned compositions , he sounds as energized and expressive as ever.The third thing is how wonderfully this gathering of absolutely first-rank jazz players works together , setting aside egos , focusing all their attention on making the music sing and ring with beauty and authority . After all , these superstar sessions do n't always work . Proof ? The gorgeous ensemble playing up to , behind , and following the leader 's stunning solo on `` Five Months from Midnight . '' Or on `` Anagram , '' a Shorter-ish piece with a tricky unison head nailed by Brecker and Metheny , then sailing off into the wild blue yonder with another heroic solo by the leader as the band provides provocative comping for him to riff off of , power-driven by some of DeJohnette 's finest drumming on disc . When Metheny comes in with his own wonderfully conceived solo statement , the feel 's one of tribute , a tip of the hat , to the leader , without the slightest shred of cutting or one-upmanship . Mehldau 's solo , one of his finest , also sparkles with wit and approbation . DeJohnette follows with some controlled mayhem on his kit , and it all ends with a reprise of the head and a rousing ensemble send-off.The churning , chugging `` Tumbleweed , '' with its wild-west feel mapped onto some ur-heartland vibe , shakes things up , nicely framed by a bit of eldritch wordless vocals and Metheny 's tasty guitar-synth solo followed by a driving statement from the leader . Mehldau keeps things rolling with a quirky , percussively outrageous solo , and everyone comes back in for a rousing finale . Certainly a high point in a record bursting with passage after passage of brilliant playing.Even the balladic `` When Can I Kiss You Again ? '' though starting out gently enough , eventually gets the fully energized treatment with an emotionally searing solo by the leader that builds gloriously and then backs into tranquility . `` Cardinal Rule '' likewise begins innocently enough only to be goosed into overdrive by some killer unison lines from , again , the leader and Metheny and a nimble solo from Patitucci . The mid-tempo , samba-like `` Half Moon Lane '' shows a mellower side of leader and band , but its pure melody , easy Latin groove , and deft yet heartfelt sensibility maintain the highest level of playing . `` Loose Threads , '' another south-of-the-border tune , but with a little more muscle and a wackily fractured sense of time , nicely caps the previous number.With `` Pilgrimage , '' the last cut , we 're deep into the mystic . Hancock 's ethereal electric piano sets the table for this symbolic voyage into the unknown . But there 's nothing New Age-y or sentimental about this piece . Instead , we get glorious sound vistas anchored to a hard-headed sense of both one 's mortality , and the hope of a better beyond , beautifully expressed in Brecker 's magical EWI solo . The sense I get is something akin to C. S. Lewis 's vision of the weight of glory , the idea that Heaven is so much more real and substantial than earthly existence that were mere mortals to travel there they would find the grass so sharp as to cut their feet.One mourns the untimely passing of such an imposing and heroic musical figure as Michael Brecker .

Some people complain that these songs have been repackaged too many times , but I have a hard time arguing with the final result.The remastering of this collection sounds as good as the Rhino remasters ( which managed to be a slight improvement over the already great-sounding Rykodisc versions ) , and I really do n't understand why some people complain about the sound ( but I never owned any of the vinyl records , so maybe I am missing something ) . Still , the sound is the best that I 've heard on CD , and in terms of song selection , this is a near-perfect set . For some , this will be all the Elvis Costello they ever need . For others , it will be the beginning of a long journey into the career of one of the best , most insightful and most interesting singer-songwriters in popular music . Either way , it 's hard to go wrong with this collection ."}, "25195": {"id": "25194", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I am a fan of Elvis Costello although a fairly recent one . This CD has a lot of the classics , the songs that people probably associate with him . But I came across a few I had never heard ( I did n't think ) and liked enormously .

Driving rock songs dominated , mostly written by Elvis , although the music sometimes hides the nature of the lyrics . For those who care , the booklet contains full lyrics for all the featured 22 songs.Elvis had three UK top ten hits during this period , these being Oliver 's army at # 2 , I ca n't stand up for falling down at # 4 and Good year for the roses at # 6 . He did not have an American top ten hit until 1989 , when he made # 10 with a song titled Veronica , but you 'll have to look elsewhere for that.In 1981 , just when people thought they knew what to expect from Elvis , he demonstrated his love of country music by recording a whole album of country songs with Billy Sherrill as producer . From this album , Good year for the roses became a UK top ten hit as noted above . Originally recorded by George Jones and a country hit for hum , the Elvis Costello version was clearly popular with a lot of British people , most of whom had never heard the song before . Country fans familiar with the original did n't all like it , but I did and still do.This collection contains the three UK top ten hits mentioned above along with a selection of lesser UK hits and album tracks . Among the lesser hits , Watching the detectives and ( do n't wan na go to Chelsea both made the UK top 20 and established Elvis 's credentials as a rock singer , and both are here . Alison ( a song later covered by Linda Ronstadt ) is also featured . Beyond those track , I do n't think anything essential is missing from my perspective , but others may disagree . I say it 's a great collection with everything that I expect of an Elvis Costello hits collection ."}, "25197": {"id": "25196", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "There have been numerous Elvis Costello compilations , but this new release focuses on the most fertile period of his career , the first ten years .

Of course no one could keep up that blinding of a pace and subsequent albums that fall into this period , Punch The Clock , Goodbye Cruel World , King Of America & Blood & Chocolate are n't as strong , but do contain some first rate material . The songs have all been dissected before and fans of Mr. Costello owns these songs probably in multiple formats , but if you want an introduction into some the finest and most creative music of the late 70 's and 80 's , then this album should be in your collection ."}, "25198": {"id": "25197", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "By 1979 Elvis Costello and the Attractions had proven themselves to be one of the best and brightest acts to come out of the English music scene . Elvis Costello had shown over the course of three very different and distinct albums that he was nothing short of a songwriting genius . After the pop success of Armed Forces it seemed that everyone , including his label , was expecting a repeat with a similar sound and style . Elvis was n't about to be put in a box and it all came to head in April of 1979 when , during a drunken argument in a bar , Costello uttered a racial slur that gained him a fair amount of backlash and suspicion . Costello has apologized on more than one occasion and has proven over the years that he 's anything but a racist . Still , the damage was done and Elvis fought his way out of it through his music . Get Happy ! ! , released in 1980 , is one of his most ambitious and exciting efforts . It 's a mile-a-minute thrill ride through Motown and R & B ; stylings that no one could have seen coming.Elvis and the band went even further by cramming a stunning 20 songs on this record , clocking in at only 48 minutes . Most artists are lucky to produce a great album with half that many and yet Costello does n't waste a minute here . `` Love for Tender '' opens the record with some upbeat organ and a fast-paced beat that immediately lets you know that Elvis is exploring the world of funk , R & B ; , Motown , and soul . `` Opportunity '' rides a classic Motown beat and gives every member of the group a chance to really shine . In fact , while The Attractions are in fine form , it 's really bassist Bruce Thomas who dominates here . His funky basslines and sense of urgency keep every song flowing smoothly while unconsciously causing you to tap your foot . The quick-paced vibe of songs like `` High Fidelity '' and `` Human Touch '' are perfect examples of the sound Costello was going for , while slower numbers like `` New Amsterdam '' and `` Secondary Modern '' hit just as hard but in a different sort way . Even a cover of `` I Ca n't Stand Up for Falling Down '' went on to become a hit , proof that Elvis could take someone else 's song and make it his own.Lyrically the album is great but that 's not surprising because Elvis is always in fine lyrical form . The man can write , tell a story , and play with words like a walking dictionary . A special nod goes to my personal favorite , `` Temptation '' . The entire song beautifully sums up the album in terms of lyrics and music . Bruce 's bassline is incredible , Pete Thomas ' drums hit you right from the beginning and the subtle keyboards of Steve Nieve leave a haunting effect in the background . It 's truly one of Costello 's best songs and the soul-sound of it is so infectious that you 'll be humming it for hours . On a record full of stellar tunes this one really drives the whole thing home.Get Happy ! ! is an experience unlike any other in EC 's catalogue . It rushes by at a lightning pace and yet loses none of the charm and sophistication of his previous offerings . With 20 songs there 's no shortage of great material here and Costello 's foray into the world of Motown and soul is nothing short of magnificent . Even the title itself is a reference to the gospel music that obviously plays a large part on this release . It 's perfect from beginning to end and has more than stood the test of time ."}, "25199": {"id": "25198", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Love For Tender is a classic . Essentially a re-write of Love Me Tender by the other better looking Elvis what can you say : ) One thing to mention is the clever monetory double meaning running throughout the lyric surely one of the more witty attempts to do this type of song - I 'll pay you a compliment , And you 'll think I am innocent , You can total up the balance sheet , And never know if I 'm a counterfeit , You wo n't take my love for tender - All sung with that negative passion he excels at . There are others goodies here too - i also think Motel Matches is on his A-List .

'' Immolation seemingly had just two goals in mind when they wrote this album : focused , straightforward , compact songwriting ( almost all of the songs stay in the neighborhood of three to four minutes ) , and furious , devastating brutality . As a result , this iconic New York quartet have never sounded this hungry , aggressive , or crushing.In fact , truth be told , Immolation have always been a death metal band , but `` Shadows in the Light '' really leans more towards the grindcore side of the line . It also boasts an abnormally long ten tracks ( opposed to the band 's usual eight or nine ) . But those two things aside , every classic Immolation hallmark trait is in place on here , including abrasive , tractor-sized riffs , unorthodox soloing , free-flowing , blasting drum beats , bludgeoning rhythms , and guttural , commanding vocals.Even though the album has a somewhat brief running time , nobody should be left feeling shortchanged after listening to it , because man , Immolation sure cram a ton into these forty minutes ! Plus , it may be the heaviest release of their career thus far , but they never forget to slip in plenty of nifty , catchy hooks , and they also incorporate just enough melody ( usually through the frequent use of lead axeman Robert Vigna 's wailing , harmonic solos ) that the songs need to be memorable and avoid monotony.Opener `` Hate 's Plague '' and `` Tarnished '' are just two of the numerous incredibly tightly-knit , punishing , and mean bruisers to be found on here , and overflow with driving , incessantly pummeling blast beats , bulldozing guitar leads , and almost demonic vocals . `` Passion Kill , '' will surely soon be a set staple in Immolation 's live show . This doom-laden piece boasts blistering riffs , solo , and a really catchy chorus ( where frontman Ross Dolan evilly growls out sinister lines like `` God will punish you/God will torture you '' ) which will instantly get tattooed to your brain . `` The Weight of Devolution '' and the title cut mix things up a bit by opting for a moderately paced tempos and surprisingly groovy rhythms ( plus , the former also features excellent , wailing solos , and the latter has strategically placed , crashing high-hats ) . But later songs , like `` Breathing the Dark , '' `` Deliverer of Evil , '' and the jackhammering `` Lying with Demons '' are positively devastating , and more than make up for those two moments of somewhat restrained heaviness . Lastly of note are the tremolo picked melodies in the Eastern-tinged set closer , `` Whispering Death . `` Immolation have a sixteen-plus year under their belts so far , and even though they have been through several different record labels and band members over the years , they show absolutely no sign of aging or inconsistency . `` SITL '' is a terrifically strong and satisfying record which proves that this band is still at the top of their game , and is still going to be around for many more years to come ."}, "25203": {"id": "25202", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "very technical death metal with killer vocals and drumming second to none guitarist is technical sounding with the band comming together to make every song exellent as usual for this great band ."}, "25204": {"id": "25203", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I noticed throughout this album 's lyrics that Jesus was hardly the subject matter . they 've separated themselves from Deicide on this album and are walking on their own path . aside from attacking Jesus , Immolation has excellent musicianship . the solos are killer , as no metal band should be without them ."}, "25205": {"id": "25204", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I might get ripped for this review , but i honestly did not enjoy this DVD at all .

Irrespective of a viewer 's political positions , whether one is liberal , radical , moderate or conservative , the problem here is that the humor is just not funny as delivered . Both Bob Hope and David Steinberg employed politically-oriented quips in their approach to humor . Perhaps some find this funny . If you do , fine . I find it boring . This show and its companion , volume 2 , are worth watching if you were not alive at that time and want to examine a thick slice of the culture . My comments pertain to both volumes.As fun viewing , the show is a failure . It does not work , even as nostalgia . It 's difficult to feel nostalgic listening to David Crosby implying the world would be a better place without oil companies . Nothing like living on a commune ! There is a vague emptiness I feel in watching these shows . Perhaps it 's because I wanted another Hullabaloo or Shindig , both of which were filled with convincing performances , great dancing and excitement . They made me smile . This show has an entirely different atmosphere . To use a term from that era , `` it 's a downer . '' Aside from the alleged humor , the performances often fall flat . One notable exception is Neil Diamond 's delivery of Holly Holy.If you are curious about a facet of the culture and music of 1969-70 , the show is worth viewing .

The fact that it is sung in English is no excuse , especially when Rusalka or the Princess is going full-bore in some big ensemble . ( Loud sopranos are more difficult to understand than loud male voices . ) I understood maybe one-third of the libretto . Given the heavy reinterpretation given this staging , the listener needs all the clues he/she can have . Fortunately , the Met Opera web site had a synopsis that filled in some holes . That 's one star off there.Secondly , the production makes hash of the story . While some of the negative comments of one of my fellow reviewers seems to me to be nitpicking , the general thrust seems to be valid : there is no way to integrate the story , what you see on stage , and what you hear.In the first place , if I had n't read the blurb on the DVD case ( one or two sentences long ) outlining the Freudian interpretation , there is no way to see it in the staging . The story interprets the staging , not the other way around.In the second place , based on this Freudian view , the ending makes no sense . Are we to believe that Rusalka should have never grown up ? Or , are we to say that all men are jerks , all women are ... , and that `` coming of age '' sexually will transform women into demonic seductresses who will inevitably kill men ? Huh ? ? ? ? ! ! ! That leads to my third criticism of the staging : a fairy story only works AS A FAIRY STORY . Since Tolkien ( Lord of the Rings ) is all the rage right now ( January 2004 ) , let me invoke him : to allegorize a fairy tale is to kill it . One must let the mythic archetypes stand on their own , speaking their own truth , telling their own story.The mis-staging costs another star.Generally , we have a four star DVD here , but these errors , 4-2 = 2 stars.P .

For me , I find the songwriting to be extremely poor , not a memorable tune here . The guitar work is unimaginative and very average . I did n't dig Geddy 's singing either -- he seems unable to write and deliver a good hook or melody . The quality of the recording stinks too .

Rush happened to be one of my favorites out of the lot . My picks for best and worst albums would differ greatly from typical Rush fans , but regardless of album I could at least find enjoyment in half the album , if not the whole thing . This caused some troubles with some of the 70 's stuff which only had 4 or 6 songs , but hey . 2112 is an amazing album.Unfortunately this album just did n't grab me . For starters the production was a little too muddy , though I could overlook that with better songs . And that 's where this album really falls flat . The song writing is just ok at best . There 's nothing to capture one 's attention with most of them . They are n't really bad or anything , they 're just there . You have Caravan which started the album off to a decent note , but that being the first single , had I known , would have worried me as it 's only a decent song . Halo Effect is by far my favorite song on here . I love the acoustic guitars , and the rest of the band puts in a solid effort , beautiful song . Garden had nice acoustic guitars as well , but I think I was hoping for more reading how much others like this song . It 's still decent though.The album feels like a bunch of ideas they decided must go into the album without thought to how they 'd work together . One song has this random bluesy acoustic guitar piece which sounds really cool and all , but really does n't fit the song and just comes from out of nowhere , though probably the best part of that song . The vocal melodies are flat out boring and uninspiring . The guitar riffs , mostly are the same , though there are a few stand out riffs to be found . Headlong Flight has a great riff and awesome verses , setting up to be a great fast paced rocker , however the chorus which is n't that great completely changes the pace , and not in a way that works . The song gets ridiculously slow . I get songs can change pace and like many songs which do this , but this particular song it did n't work . Bu2b or whatever had the same problem . The verses were kind of groove rock and the chorus got all fast , in a way that did n't work for me.The main problem is this album is forgettable . I 've had to listen to it several times even to remember a lot of the songs , and even now I can only remember parts of some of them . I should n't have to listen to an album 15 times for something to grow on me . There should be a few songs which stand out imediately and there were n't , just a couple that later grew on me . It seems when Rush tries to put out an album of more than 8 or 9 actual songs , not counting instrumentals , they lose focus . If there 's another album in them I really hope they take their time with it and really focus on the songs rather than just slapping every idea they have together and hoping it fits . These guys are better than this.Overall this album felt like it was just all over the place with almost nothing worth coming back for . If you 're a Rush fanatic you 'll enjoy it . If you like Rush , but accept that not all their work is gold you may want to listen to it first , and if you like it then buy it ."}, "25234": {"id": "25233", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Ah ! Brian Regan , the bastian of clean comedy in America whether he 's family friendly , or not . The question of clean comedy vs dirty comedy and right and wrong is n't what goes on in my head and I pity those who think it 's about that ( and I know there are more than a few in his audience ) . There are funny comedians on both sides of the fence and Regan is squeaky clean which makes me look at him differently . Kevin James is largely clean and others are clean and lame , but what 's wrong with having a few jokes that do n't fly with little kids and when was stand-up comedy about universal appeal or understanding ? Taking these things into account I understand where Regan is coming from being from a middle class Protestant household with history in Mennonite . He strays from anything that would be impolite , crass , rude , or unappealing to anyone within earshot because the most impressionable and sheltering audiences run at the first sign of dissent , not to mention a dangerous tone of voice . This results in his comedy being akin to clown shoes , a prop that serves no purpose in the service of comedy . To others more accustomed to personalized comedy it comes off as less than honest even when he talks about himself or his family . To me , he 's not funny at all . Even comedians I ca n't relate to are funnier . It just seems that he boxes himself in , rather than being himself and in the process he ca n't reach profound comedy , or entertaining humor at all outside of this sheltered audience . If you 're an adult and you like Regan I have no interest in hearing your tastes apart from him , he 's that bad to me on this cd . This started it all and I 've seen his specials on TV thinking he must pick something funny off of the road and he 's always terrible , worse even .

I get all of that.But still , the album is horrendous . As you listen to it , you can not help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he 's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album . However , he is wrong . Horribly wrong . The arrangement of each `` song '' is sub-par , the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life , and then there 's Shatner himself . With his trademark delivery , Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track , and that 's really not such a good thing.This album would be utterly forgettable , if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have . Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review : THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE , IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE . I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks , long before it was in print on CD in the States , and even now , when I could have bought it for half the price , it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.You see , whenever I 'm feeling blue , I pop The Shatner into my CD player , and everything gets a little bit better . It never fails to bring a smile to my face , especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.Honestly , this CD is glorious in it 's sheer awfulness .

That 's just Trekkie spin . What you have here is one of the most blatant examples of a hyper-inflated Hollywood ego making a complete public fool of itself . If a normal person did anything like this , on the morning after they would seriously contemplate hara-kiri.Shatner 's vocal theatrics are a mockery of the acting profession - enough to make a person laugh themselves into a hernia or lose whatever they ate during the last 18 hours - except that the joke is on him . He actually thinks he is amazing even the angels with his talent . But no . His rendition of `` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds '' probably earned him a 600 year stint in that part of purgatory reserved for airport lounge singers.All said , this CD is so terrible that it has one redeeming quality - it would make an excellent white elephant gift next Christmas ."}, "25237": {"id": "25236", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "First - I love David Gilmour ... and believe he was more the 'sound ' of Pink Floyd than Roger .

The bad part about it , however , is that he speaks so softly that you ca n't hear anything he says without turning up the volume quite a bit . I would guess that the music is played at twice the volume as his voice when he speaks to the audience.The intro sets the stage for what is to come : a very , very slow version of `` Shine On You Crazy Diamonds '' which is played again later in the set at more of a pace that Pink Floyd fans are used to . There are a couple times during the set when David plugs in the electric guitar for a guitar solo but throughout the set I found myself wanting to turn it off in favor of watching the `` Pulse '' dvd instead.Overall I was very disappointed and if it were easier and possible I would return it for something else .

In short , the DVD transfer is horrible . Granted , the original 16mm film was not a professional job either , but this DVD appears as if it was derived from a very poor copy of the Beatles ' film.I have seen MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in many formats . Years ago I found a 16mm film copy in the library . I borrowed this print several times . The the picture was very clear , but the sound was poor . Later I bought a VHS copy through MEDIA . The original VHS copy was about the same quality as the film , except that it was convenient to play on a video cassette recorder . Still later I bought a `` remastered digitally enhanced '' VHS copy . The picture was about the same as previous editions , but the sound was greatly improved.Recently I bought the DVD release . I was somewhat concerned that the DVD did not display the Apple Logo , but I had heard that this film drifted into the public domain a few years ago . I was sadly disappointed at the quality of the DVD . Nothing was done to improve this copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR . The color is washed out , picture is grainy , and the sound is worse than the original 16mm film . About the only benefit of the DVD is that enjoys the semi-permanence of being on DVD and you can jump from chapter to chapter.As for the film itself , this was the Beatles first attempt -- outside of some of their music promos -- at making a film . It was designed to be for television , so it was captured on 16mm color film . The plot is simple : The Beatles and friends load onto a bus to take a sight-seeing tour of England . These tours were standard fare for Brits in the late 1960s . Along the way the passengers and crew of the bus encounter some odd scenery and situations . In between there are some great Beatles musical numbers.Okay , the film itself is not Oscar material . It is more like something you would expect from someone showing off a new home movie/video camera . However , it is classic Beatles . There was not much of a script for this movie and John , George , Paul and Ringo all took part in the production . Apparently all four Beatles were involved in the editing , though never at the same time . As such , the film took on conflicting directions depending on who was in the editing room . Paul even slipped in his solo `` Fool on the Hill '' promo from Southern France.We have all heard the legend . This film bombed on British television . It was broadcast in black and white . Later it was rebroadcast in color in a bad time slot . Worse yet , the film was blown up to 35mm and premiered in theaters . Still , it heralded the creation of Apple . All four Beatles would be involved in numerous other film projects and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was good experience.If you do not already have a VHS copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR , I recommend that you wait for Apple to re-release a restored copy .

The people who filmed and edited this concert must have been drunk or stupid because they definitely did not capture the concert like they should have . First of all , what 's with all the shots of the audience ? The shot of the girl dancing during `` Message In A Bottle '' does not make sense at all , the shots of the audience grooving during `` Wrapped Around Your Finger '' are pointless , the shots of those weirdos waving to the camera during `` De Do Do Do , De Da Da Da '' are dumb , and the shot of some teenager dancing real fast during one of the last songs makes me want to go back in time and break the cameras that were used to film the audience . Okay , there should be maybe some shots of an audience for a concert DVD but 98 % of the focus should always be on the musicians . Next , why are there almost no shots of Sting playing the bass ? Did the camera people forget that he was the bassist of the Police as well as the lead singer ? The camera only seems to be interested in his head . The guy is an excellent bass player and the directors for some reason chose to ignore that . Only on the multi angle tracks along with a few others can you see Sting playing the bass . Another extremely annoying factor about the camera work is that the backing singers get way too much camera time . Even when they are not actually singing , they are still shown . Why would the directors and editors choose to show the backing singers dancing instead of the band playing ? I do n't get it . Other crazy choices for the filming include that stupid strobe effect on `` Spirits In The Material World '' and that slow motion thing on `` Tea In The Sahara .

Otherwise I would not give it any stars . Someone needs to come out with a much better Police concert DVD that is filmed the way it should be . I 'm sure there is other footage that exists .

The score used in the original movie is a pallid , third-rate job that does nothing to advance the action or to support the eerie , `` film noir '' feel of the camera work .

'' 20th Century Fox wasted little time in developing a new property for their new star , and ( possibly under the influence of FUNNY GIRL , the great stage success that was set to film at about the same time ) reached back in time to tell the story of a theatrical legend : Gertrude Lawrence.It seemed like a winner . Gertrude Lawrence ( 1902-1952 ) was known as `` The Toast of Two Continents '' in an era when the term had an almost literal meaning , and the highs and lows of her extremely public private life were almost as dramatic as her career . Operating with an incredibly large budget and under the direction of Robert Wise , the bio-pic STAR ! seemed to have everything : lavish sets , incredible costumes , a truly great collection of songs , an epic running time , and -- of course -- Julie Andrews . What more could you want ? Well , an interesting movie would be nice.STAR ! opened with tremendous fanfare in 1968 and proved an instant fiasco . All the earnings of THE SOUND OF MUSIC were wiped out seemingly overnight , and with bankruptcy staring it in the face 20th Century Fox cut the film from three to two hours and rushed the film into general release as THOSE WERE THE HAPPY TIMES . As a result , the film holds the dubious distinction of being the only major Hollywood film to completely tank twice in major theatrical release.At the time , much of the film 's failure was laid at the feet of Julie Andrews . Gertrude Lawrence , her remarkable career , and her high-flying lifestyle were still well-recalled in 1968 , and Julie Andrews simply did not look , walk , talk , sing , or in any way , shape or form bear any resemblance to her . Seen today , however , this seems an unfair accusation ; it is very evident that the project was never intended as a recreation of Lawrence , and Julie Andrews is actually quite good within the very tight limitations imposed upon her . The real problem is the script , which goes nowhere at a slow crawl . Indeed , the single most dramatic event in the entire story is Lawrence 's financial bankruptcy ! Yes , you can enjoy the sights and sounds of STAR ! But the story is beyond boring : it makes you feel that you 're sinking slowly to the bottom of a sea of Jello . The DVD has been criticized for leaving out the few minutes of intermission material that accompanied the original release ; frankly , I ca n't see this as anything more than a mercy , for the less time spent here the better . As for the bonuses , they are okay -- which is to say that they are actually more interesting than the film itself .

Shostakovich 's opera includes some violence and sex which does appear on stage in live performances . In this film it looks like some sort of pseudo-artsy and highly unbelievable soft porn flick . To give an example , the fat woman who gets raped ( they show it with dim warm lighting ) acts like she is being tickled with a feather , which is not the idea that the score portrays . There are also a lot of very '90 's looking men with really the sort of buffed symetrical appearance you get from working in a gym , and not the rugged look you 'd have among people who perform manual labour all day . Or in the bedroom scene with Katerina and Sergei - their textbook writhings allow embarrasing glimpses at the one part of Sergei which should ( judging by Hrubesova 's movement ) be most 'involved ' , but which we clearly see in an entirely different condition and nowhere near where it would have to be to cause the effect she is displaying . You can also see a little piece of cloth between them sometimes , when clearly nothing of that sort is meant to be there . Fair enough , the cloth is there even if you do n't see it , but the fact that all this is shown makes their 'beast with two backs ' act seem ridiculous and insulting . It 's actually a matter of bad editing ( and bad taste ) .

This paradox of it being too literal and too fake at once applies not just to the sex scenes , but to the whole film in general . It 's rather insulting really in how fake it is . The film as a whole is just so cheap and lacks the tight and oppressive atmosphere of the score.The CD of the complete opera is available from amazon.com and I can not recommend it highly enough . Vishnevskaya is miraculous , and the conducting by her husband Rostropovich ( both personal friends of the composer ) is inspired . Rostropovich and Shostakovich studied composition together , and although not all of Rostropovich 's recordings of Shostakovich are first rate , this is the definitive ( and most alive ) rendition .

[ from 'Mother ' ] Lyrics that basically punch you in the face with their ideas are not really intended for thinking people . A self-pitying thirteen-year old asked to write some doggrell about their own feelings of adolescent angst might , for example , have scribbled the following lines on the bus to school : I 've got wild staring eyes.And I 've got a strong urge to fly.But I got nowhere to fly to . [ from 'Nobody home ' ] Feeling sorry for yourself , as George C. Scott once remarked , is the most popular indoor sport : it rarely makes for artistic greatness , however . And here the listener is being asked to choke on two whole jars of it.Some of the songs are of such absurd brevity as to leave the listener with a cheated feeling ; others are inexplicably bookended by random fragments of dialogue or puzzling sound effects . It 's a mess , in short . But so myopic and self-impressed were the Floyds that the album underwent the fate of being reworked into a bloviated motion picture and an even more pompous concert in Berlin .

This is to their credit , but it is an endorsement that still fails to account for , much less exonerate the boys for the fact that they were just another sad facet of the hippie fad.If we examine some of the Doors most prominent and unfortunately least appealing features , we will find a very bland , monotonous , predictable , and last but not least , pretentious band . The excessive feature of the organ often sounds like an underpaid Church accompanist finally reaching breakdown and leading a mutiny of one against the house of God . Krieger 's penchant for small , twangy lead guitar riffs in virtually every Door 's song is perhaps a little less annoying but still makes a mockery out of hyperbolic claims Doors enthusiasts often make about their place in history . But all of this pales in comparision to the pseudo-intellectual bleatings of a rock and roll idol whose rocky road to success ended in a French bathtub . `` Light My Fire '' could have potentially been a classic of the 60 's era , of which there are many . In spite of its daft lyrics , the really baffoonish way of rhyming things like `` liar '' and `` higher '' , it had the makings of a decent little ditty . The emphasis there is on `` little '' . Instead , it was expanded , bloated beyond all proportion to its actual merit with Ray Manzarek 's obnoxious , sedating organ . This is an excellent example of the quality of the recalcitrant Church accompanist quality I mentioned earlier that Manzarek 's playing exhibits . After what feels like at least a couple of days , but in reality is more like 2 minutes of this tired self indulgence , one gets the feeling that there 's only one other organ Manzarek abuses this gratuitously . Unfortunately , the boys are n't finished . They have more excess , more indulgent trash to heap upon this rapidly gathering pile of refuse in the form of Krieger 's customary and by now obligatory tiny twangs . God , this guy is awful . Like Manazerk 's mischievous meddling of the organ keys , Krieger 's turn in the spotlight is all too long and very , very unwelcomed . Finally after approximately 5 minutes of musical noodling , Morrison returns to recite lines that were poor the first time around , again.Jim and the boys continue to drag their collective knuckles in the mire on the wimpy , moronic `` Crystal Ship '' . With lyrics that appear to have been scrawled by an acne riddled junior high school student in haste to complete a poetry assignment and music that would not sound out of place on an elevator , this is the kind of song that most people would be personally embarrassed to have written , much less record and release . `` Break On Through '' has familiar organ tinkering from Manzarek . Not just familiar in the sense that it 's the kind of rubbish his grubby fingers are always immersed in , but also due to the nagging suspicion one has that this has been done somewhere before in the 1950 's and immortalized in a 1980 's Pee Wee Herman movie of all places . `` Tequila ! `` , if that helps . Aside from its sad derivative sound , it contains some characteristically pretentious attempts at `` poetry '' by Jimbo before he himself proceeds to inflict the most damage on his credibility by shrieking the idiotic line `` everybody loves my baby ! '' over and over , seemingly ad infinitum.Perhaps the real tip of the hat should go to `` The End '' . More pseudo poetry from Morrison . It 's clearly an effort to shock and unsettle listeners . It 's not only embarrassing drivel masquerading as poetry , but it 's not even original in the aspects that are supposed to be the most shocking . The killer , awaking before dawn proceeds to kill his father and make love to his mother . Although maybe the average Doors fan is unaware of this ( can they even read ? ) but this is a concept that is of course directly lifted from Sophocles . It should be noted that Morrison 's ambition was to be taken seriously as a poet and not just a rock and roll star , but his `` poetry '' was routinely derided and dismissed by critics . Anyone asking why need only listen to the 11 plus minutes of the tedious , pseudo-shockfest of `` The End '' .The only good thing about the above track is that it does mark the end of a very pitiful listening experience . Jim Morrison to his credit , went through all of the rapid stages that accompany many of the most exaggerated rock stars in the space of just a few years . He hit his commercial and `` artistic '' ( sic ) peak and was regarded as a sex symbol . Within a few years however , he had become dumpy , bedraggled , and clearly out of ideas . He then died embarrassingly , a sad drug related death of a burned out case . It took Elvis two decades , Morrison did it in about four years . Live fast indeed.On a footnote , I visited Paris recently and had the chance to see the cemetery in Montmartre where Sartre and Beckett are buried . I did wonder about the whereabouts of Morrison , but he is buried in the Eastern part of the city and we were staying in the North .

I Know There 's An Answer , Here Today , and You Still Believe In Me are slightly captivating among the remaining songs . The problem here at least to my ears is that the songs all have a similar arrangement . Not slow and romantic like Surfer Girl or Warmth of The Sun or fast and jumpy like Fun Fun Fun and Surfin ' USA . Its all mid-paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effects.It boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this CD as the third greatest rock n roll album of all time . Geeze Louise , this album barely even rocks ! There is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef ! fects . It trudges along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end . The harmonies all sound the same after a while and Brian hogs most of the lead vocals . The lyrics may have some special meanings but that 's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music . How anyone can compare this to even the weakest of Beatles records is ludicrous.In my opinion , stick with a good compilation of the Beach Boys . California Girls , Help Me Rhonda , I Get Around , and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping . I have three of them and they all work fine .

When you have both Paul McCartney and George Harrison taking an interest in your work let alone Todd Rundgren producing as well , it 's safe to say that you 're on to something big and that 's exactly what this album represents .

One mistake here , though , is Jackie Gleason 's `` Melancholy Serenade '' mistakenly titled 'Theme from the Honeymooners ' .

It is actually Gleason 's theme for his live self-titled variety show of the early 50s , where the 'The Honeymooners ' was popularized .

I , myself , have always had a big thing for all three . `` Like Young '' , a bit of a `` beat '' tune , is possibly best sung , as it is here by Linda Lawson . `` Moritat ( A Theme from The Threepenny Opera ) '' is one of my favorites , though ( popularly known as `` Mack the Knife '' ) , here an instrumental piece .

And while I generally love Alex Ligertwood 's vocals ( especially his work with Santana ! ) , they just do n't work here . In fact , both vocal inclusions seem silly and totally out of place.Second : the recording seems to have no idea of what it wants to say or where it wants to go . Most songs are not written by Jay , and perhaps this has something to do with it.Third : aimless , general tunes , out of place vocals , lame and silly Jamaican/Caribbean/Reggae-like numbers are completely out of charcater for SG , and they are a rather embarrassing inclusion here , IMHO.On the brighter side -- Birks Law ( written by Jay ) is a decent tune.In conclusion , this is one of the weaker efforts by what I consider a great group . I have been an ardent fan and follower of the group since their inception . I have seen them live many times . I admire Jay and his work . I generally like most SG songs .

Smith is , undeniably , the most successful Christian musician ever . But his third album unfortunately lacked the timeless elements of his first two ( and fourth ) albums . At the time of its release , THE BIG PICTURE was very big . We loved it and could n't get enough of it ( that is , until we finally had enough ) . It was one of those contemporary Christian albums that had a lot of hype and had not trouble living up to the hype . But it lacked the potential to maintain the audience 's interest as the artist matured and especially as the audience matured ( the target audience was clearly young teenagers -- more on this later ) .The majority of these songs though quite good in their own way were mostly what one may call fad songs . There 's nothing here that is similar to the musical style in PROJECT , 2 , or even I2 ( EYE ) . This was clearly Michael W. Smith 's attempt had a little bit of edgey , fast-paced rock 'n ' roll . And it worked at the time . ( David Meece did something very similar with his album 7 . ) THE BIG PICTURE boasted a more daring Smitty as well : one who was not afraid to tackle the what , at the time , were pretty tough and taboo issues . `` Old Enough to Know '' dealt with a young lady 's struggle in the areas of peer pressure regarding sexuality ; `` The Last Letter '' addressed the theme of suicide , which became quite an ordeal among teens in the 80s ; and `` Goin ' Through the Motions '' addressed general peer pressure among young people in general . The messages contained in these songs were positive , uplifting , and fortunately , very effective . But as this music was written for me and my generation when we were around the ages of 12-17 years old , we have now outgrown it . We may , to a much lesser extent , deal with some of these issues ; but as we are now in our late 20s and 30s , we deal with altogether different issues . And though there 's now a new generation of 12-17-year-olds dealing with the aforementioned problems , they 're going to seek out help in more contemporary music . ( I hope the music will have the same good advice as this one had . ) But very few , if any , will look for that kind of guidance from a 20 year old Christian rock album.The first four songs on here are memorable , nostalgic , and overall enjoyable . `` Rocketown '' is the only one which I would say has `` timeless '' appeal . The `` Bonus Track 1 '' is a very short piano-only piece which is somewhat reminiscent of one of Elton John 's more classic melodies .

These Bach Violin Concertos ( and previous recordings ) show Andrew Manze to obviously be a violinist of extreme technical ability as far as negotiating complex passages , however what he has in complex passages work he is lacking in flowing melodic line , solid intonation , smooth articulation and beauty of sound . His playing often sounds scratchy , awkward and uneven . The tone he emits from his instrument is not attractive and his phrasing sounds unnatural.Let 's look at the A minor concerto in detail and compare it to Jaap Schroder/Academy of Ancient Music/Christopher Hogwood 's recording on Decca 400 080 ( IDN 3259140008026 Out-of-print ) or ( A Minor Concerto on Uni/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 43326 ASIN : B000004CYD and E Major Concerto on Pgd/L'Oiseau-Lyre - # 448178 ASIN : B000004CYP ) .Let 's talk about the engineering of the recording , first . When the A minor recording first started I was struck by the boxy closed-in sound of the Manze recording and it 's lack of high overtones from the baroque violins . The prominence of the Manze 's violin overpowers the orchestra . On the other hand , Schroder 's recording is much better balanced with a really nice ambiance to the recording with a decay time of about 2 seconds , perfect . Schroder 's recording has the nice high bright silky overtones which the original instruments should have.For the performance , Manze shows uneven articulation and wavering intonation that is not enjoyable to listen to . Also , there is a lack of what I would call buoyancy to the Manze recording . Schroder has a command of the music with solid intonation combined with smooth articulation . Schroder 's fast movements are buoyant and soaring when needed . While listening to the slow movement of the Schroder recording , I was lulled into ecstasy . Manze , on the other hand takes the slow movement too slow and his tone is uneven during long notes . In one instance he reaches a high note and there is a definite slide up into the note that is very irritating.As a side note , another alternate recording that is almost as good if not as good in it 's own way as the Schroder recording is the one by Elizabeth Wallfisch on Virgin Records - # 61558 ( ASIN : B00000J2PS ) .All in all , the Manze recording of Bach 's Violin Concertos makes for an unsatisfying listening experience .

OK , so two or three of the 14 cuts on this release may have made it on Your Hit Parade , it 's pretty safe to say the remaining cuts never even got a cardboard sales award ! It is rumored that The Beatles were inspired by Anita 's hit recording of the `` Music Man '' gem , `` Till There Was You '' to cut their own version of the song . `` Paper Roses '' is probably the single record Bryant is best remembered for ... but even this record has been overshadowed by Marie Osmond 's hit cover some years later , which pretty much made Anita 's recording stale and forgotten . After a string of modestly selling albums for Columbia , the label dumped her long before her well known hate crusade against gays , indicating her career was in trouble years before she claimed political adversaries had derailed it . Her last album for Columbia was a pathetic dud of a love theme album that really showcased Anita 's failing vocal abilities along with cornpone arrangements that would put a monkey infused with gallons of Starbucks to sleep . At that time , and sadly , the singer 's voice was becoming dark , leathery and unappealing with a drastic loss of range long before its time . But on she forged with the sacred label Word out of Wacco , Texas . It seemed like a solid home for the often sacred singer , but Anita 's output with the label lacked inspiration and all their efforts paled in comparison to her sacred releases with Columbia ( especially the pop-inspriational Columbia album , `` I Beleive '' ) . Certainly the most embarassing release of her entire career was a lack-luster , unspired live religious album with Word which was released not long before they showed her the door ( most likely due to massive compliants from record buyers offended by Bryant 's hate crusades , along with dismal record sales and that failing voice ) . On this live recording , the singer offered unending testimonies about how she was grand enough to lead her flocks to The Lord if they bought her records and books ... it was obvious that Anita now believed The Lord was an employee of Anita Bryant ministries ... the time left on the LP consisted of poorly performed & darkly arranged sacred tunes . Along her career path , Bryant managed to write a long series of books for religious publishers mostly offering Anita 's guidence on how to have a perfect family like her 's . However , even her most ardent supporters jumped off The Good Gospel Ship Anita Bryant , after she dumped her first husband , the father of her children and the co-subject of her happy family sagas . One of the last straws for her public was an outlandish , interview Anita Bryant actually granted with Playboy magazine ... where she discussed everything from her political crusades to her orgasims . To top it all , reports have surfaced that one of Anita 's sons has been outted as being gay . With a career that nose-dived into financial ruin and a failing voice , bankruptcies were not far away via theaters Bryant and her latest husband established in places like Branson , Missouri and Pidgeon Forge , Tennesse , that went bottoms-up , while Anita prayed with casts & employees , guarenteeing the Lord 's blessing on everyone that stuck with her ... she would secretly 'get out of Dodge ' , leaving a few ticket holders in the lurch , and bilking employess and fellow performers out of back pay , including one of her loyal fan club members . Many believe it was actually her failing career , including being dumped by Columbia Records , that prompted MS Bryant to try to jump start her failing career with her ugly policical crusade , rather than any kind of religious conviction . Finding work almost non-existance in this new century , and finding she was n't welcome in several states due to bankruptcies , MS Bryant is reviving `` Anita Bryant Ministeries '' online in a desperate and sadly pathetic attempt at financial survival ... I ca n't help but wonder if she 's seeking a new Playboy interview to bring things full circle ! Unlike everyother artist that was popualr when Bryant enjoyed her biggest success , there has been no interest or demand in issuing her recorded material on CD 's ... with this one exception ."}, "25433": {"id": "25432", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I was quite disappointed upon receiving my copy of this CD after seeing all the 5 star ratings given by other users .

The songs suffer from a similarity in sound/tempo/theme such that you are basically listening to one long song throughout the 12 cuts .

Back then , I thought both bands were such musically-brilliant , insightful bands because of the fact that they were marketed as bands that were heavy metal yet were insightful and thought-provoking , and being the gullable kid I was due to my lack of knowledge of underground music at the time , I ate them both up like hotcakes . For the last seven years or so , I 've been neck-deep in underground metal and industrial bands , and to say that I 've burned my bridges to Tool and RATM would be an understatement . Rather , it would be more appropriate to say that I hijacked a TOS-1 Buratino flamethrower tank and not only decimated said bridges with the tank 's massive thermobaric rocket payload , but also decimated any nearby engineering firms that could have rebuilt those bridges to said alt-metal bands . Okay , enough of my rambling , on to reviewing Tool 's `` Aenima . `` Listening to this album as an adult , I ca n't help but get infuriated by it . This album infuriates me because aside from sounding so drab for being a `` heavy '' rock band , it totally reeks of dishonesty for the fact that it 's marketed as an intelligent slab of music yet it tightly-clings to such juvenille aesthetics that do n't gel at all with aesthetics that are supposed to be `` higher class . '' Even if the juvenille lyrics in some songs are supposed to be ironic humor , it did n't work because I 'm not laughing.MUSICIANS/MUSICIANSHIPWhile many of the musicians here have some instrumental talent by themselves , they do n't win much points from me because they do n't craft much music on this album that I actually like.Maynard James Keenan is an extremely overrated singer . His vocalwork is one of the main reasons why I hate this album , since his vocals usually are either really bad `` anguished '' singing or pseudo-aggressive yelling , in which both styles would be right at home with your run-of-the-mill 90 's nu-metal ( or alternative metal for those who demand euphamisms ) or Nine Inch Nails album ( yuck ) .His songwriting is n't impressive at all , either . So much of his lyrics on this album are like what you 'd read from an angry high schooler 's notebook who 's in an introductory philosophy class , so it 's like a mix of bad , angsty poetry and pseudo-intellectual ramblings . Some songs like `` Fourty Six and Two '' and `` Third Eye '' exemplify the pseudo-intellectual lyrics , while songs like `` Hooker With a Penis '' ( brilliant song title ) have lyrics as if they were yanked straight out of an angry 15 year-old 's mouth.Adam Jones is a guitarist that has skill ( though is inferior to the likes of Chuck Schuldiner and Ron Jarzombek ) , but a lot of what he 's made on this album is really flat and uninspired . The only song where any of his riffs and solos sound like there 's some energy in them are in `` Third Eye , '' while it seems like the rest are just grunge/nu-metal riffs played in an `` artsy '' manner or flat , simplified progressive rock riffs with an occasional polyrhythm . Most of the solos are n't that good , either , since so many of them sound like half-baked , goofy `` feedback '' solos you 'd hear from Tom Morello ( another painfully overrated guitarist ) .Justin Chancellor 's bass is interesting in areas , though nothing that really grabbed my attention . If it counts for anything , at least his bass is more audible in this album than most rock albums out there.Danny Carey is a drummer that 's been showered with tons of praise . Now he is a skilled drummer , but skill with an instrument does n't mean they automatically can make interesting songs . True , in a lot of the songs on this album , Carey does some neat , technical stuff with his skins , but they ca n't save the songs for the fact that so many of them are either boring or downright irritating.SONGSThe only song on this album I 'd say is promising is `` Third Eye . '' In fact , I 'd say that for the most part , it shows that when pressed , Tool 's rhythm section can come up with dynamic , interesting music ( especially since this one clocks in at 14 minutes ) . However , it gets ruined with Maynard 's lousy vocalwork , especially when he screams out `` Prying open my third eye ! ! `` .The `` hit '' songs like `` Stinkfist '' and `` Aenima '' are examples of the grunge/nu-metal songs with an `` artsy '' glaze applied to them , and boy do they sound annoying . They honestly do n't sound much different ( or much better ) than the typical grunge/nu-metal gunk infesting the mainstream at the time this album came out.Other songs like `` Push1t '' and `` Eulogy '' are examples of trying-too-hard-yet-flat progressive-rock with the occasional `` heavy '' moments on this album , and when I 'm not chuckling at Maynard 's attempts to come off as a deep thinker , I 'm usually wallowing in boredom over how bloodless most of them feel.There 's filler tracks like `` Message to Harry Manback , '' `` Intermission , '' and `` Die Eeir Von Satan '' that add next to nothing in terms of musical quality , in that they only pad out the running length of the album.PRODUCTIONThe production quality on this album is n't bad , since all the vocals , guitars , bass , and drums come in rather clear . However , like with all music , good sound quality ca n't save lousy music.FINAL WORDDespite all the heavy marketing and hype from the likes of MTV and Tool fans , this album is NOT a progressive metal masterpiece that will stretch your mind and change your life.If you 're looking for some actual metal albums that have brilliant musicianship , innovative ideas , creativity , or thoughtful lyrics ( or a combination of any ) , I strongly suggest you invest your time and money on these albums instead ( and yes , I 've listened to and own all of these ) : Death : `` Human '' Cynic : `` Focus '' Pestilence : `` Spheres '' Phantasmagory : `` Odd Sounds '' Atheist : `` Piece of Time '' Spastic Ink : `` Ink Complete '' Blotted Science : `` The Machinations of Dementia '' Gordian Knot : `` S/T '' Bunkur : `` Bludgeon '' Neurosis : `` Souls at Zero '' Godflesh : `` Pure '' Blut Aus Nord : `` MoRT '' Pan.Thy.Monium : `` Khaooohs '' Meshuggah : `` Destroy Erase Improve '' Do n't be surprised that if you get engrossed in any of the above albums and own a copy of Tool 's `` Aenima , '' that you find yourself getting rid of said Tool album ."}, "25444": {"id": "25443", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "if you do n't like this band and worship the members as gods , you are an inferior being and for that i look down my nose at you even though i 'm only fifteen like i know what the hell i 'm talking about . the benevolent reverend maynard told me to be myself and open my mind to new ideas so i snub people who have different opinions from me . tool are the most amazing , intellectual , spiritual , aesthetically pleasing sonic experience i 've ever had and because of that , i 'm in a class all my own and ca n't be touched . nevermind the fact that aenima has gone platinum and everyone else who owns it thinks the same exact thing . i 'm still my own person and i 'm still better than you because tool are gods . you can come crawling back to me when you 've realized the musical genious and sonic voyage that is tool , and only then will i treat you as an equal . i 'm open minded . i listen to tool.has anyone else had this experience when talking to a tool fan ? they have this single-minded ferocity similar to that of a born-again christian or a member of the 'holy rollers ' . it 's weird.anyway , as for the music , i like the songs eulogy , message to harry manback , hooker with a penis , intermission and die eier von satan . i 'd like the rest if i had n't heard the singles a million times and if the rest did n't get so boring . it just kind of goes on and on , and is n't really as layered as you may be lead to believe by these reviews .

In 2006 , this sort of reinvention of Bowie is something that was expected , but in 1970 , this must have been rather unexpected . Influencing this change was no doubt the presecne of guitar hero Mick Ronson , whose embracing of distortion and feedback made this entirely possible . The results of this change , quite honestly , are a lot more mixed then most Bowie fans would lead you to believe -- `` The Man Who Sold the World '' has been elevated to cult status and truthfully it 's not that the album is bad per se , it 's just that it 's not particularly exciting.Bowie lets us know right away that things have changed -- `` Width of a Circle '' is an extended cut drenched in feedback and distorted guitars with a galloping bassline ( played by producer Tony Visconti ) and a rambling vocal from Bowie . No doubt it woke a lot of people up as to the change of direction , and it proves to be a decent number . But Bowie seems incapable of really sustaining this and seems unsure how to integrate it into his idiom -- `` All the Madmen '' starts as a bleak acoustic ballad before overdriven guitars and a downright irritating synth line get in the way , `` After All '' ends up being a dull Lou Reedish ballad , and many of the metalish pieces are pretty much unmemorable ( `` She Shook Me Cold '' , the lyrically fantastic `` Running Gun Blues '' ) . The album closes on a high note , with the bizarre folk/metal fusion title track ( made famous decades later by Nirvana 's performance of it on MTV ) and the fractured , paranoid , and downright bizarre metal churn of `` The Superman '' , but the album is a bit too inconsistent to be a completely satisfying listen.There 's enough on here to make it worth a pickup for those exploring Bowie 's catalog , but he 'd do siginificantly better work in the very near future .

'' . As far as Down South music was concerned I had just got into liking No Limit Records and I had awlays been fans of Down South artists like Outkast , Scarface & The Geto Boys , etc . Eventhough , I liked Ha ! , I did n't know what to expect from a Juvenile CD , so I did n't purchase any Cash Money CDs . When I saw B.G . 's video for `` Bling Bling '' that fetaured all of the Cash Money artists then I decided to purchase Juvenile 's `` 400 Degreez '' and B.G . 's `` Chopper City In The Ghetto '' . After listening to both CDs , Cash Money was addded to my favorite Down South list , especially once No Limit Records started getting weaker once they let their producers , Beats By The Pound , stop producing the majority of their tracks.One of the first tracks that I remember hearing Lil Wayne on was a track called `` Play'n It Raw '' that was on B.G . 's `` Chopper City In The Ghetto '' CD . The song featured B.G. , Juvenile , Lil Wayne & Turk , which I would later find out were The Hot Boys . Once I heard Lil Wayne on that track , I knew that once he made a solo CD that he would be a force to be reckoned with . Once The Hot Boys came out with `` Guerilla Warfare '' , which was a nice CD by the way , Lil Wayne was amped and ready to drop `` The Block Is Hot '' . Once I heard that CD I knew that Lil Wayne would be ready for big things . The CD would end up in heavy rotation and my favorite tracks ended up being the title track , `` Kisha '' w/The Hot Boys , `` High Beamin ' '' w/B.G . and my all time Lil Wayne favorite track `` Loud Pipes '' w/Juvenile , B.G . & The Big Tymers.Lil Wayne 's next CD was entitled `` Lights Out '' . He had nice tracks on there but `` Lights Out '' was n't as good as `` The Block Is Hot '' , in my opinion . My favorite tracks ended up being `` Hit U Up '' and `` Shine '' w/The Hot Boys , and `` Get Off The Corner '' . Once controversy started hitting Cash Money with Juvenile and B.G . leaving , Mack 10 getting overpaid and the breakup of The Hot Boys , I did n't like the direction Cash Money was going in so I did n't purchase `` 500 Degreez '' especially after hearing `` The Way Of Life '' with TQ of all people.However , Lil Wayne rebounded immensely with `` The Carter '' . Backed with Mannie Fresh beats , Lil Wayne even surprised me with his lyrical content and the overall flow of the CD . My favorite track was `` BM J.R. '' but I loved the singles `` Bring It Back '' & `` Go DJ '' and his tribute to the Hot Boys , `` I Miss My Dawgs '' .To be honest with you , after I heared that Mannie Fresh was leaving Cash Money , I was saying to myself even if Lil Wayne decides to come out with a `` Carter 2 '' that it would n't be tight without Mannie on the boards . I can admit , however , I was wrong . `` The Carter 2 '' starts off with a wicked 5 and a half minute , no chorus track entitled `` Tha Mobb '' where Lil Wayne sounds like he is freestyling over a Heatmakerz track . After listening to the track twice , I said to myself , I guess he does n't need Mannie Freah after all . Then the 3 part track which includes `` Fly In '' , Track 13 , `` Carter 2 '' and `` Fly Out '' , I was amazed by how Lil Wayne is basically rapping which appear to be freestyle rhymes . Tmix & Batman should be commended by the track , as well as , giving the production over these tracks that are fed by Lil Wayne 's lyrics . `` Money On My Mind '' features a tight sample and Lil Wayne is able to contibute 3 nice verses over the track . Now I know I may upset some people with this assessment but `` Fireman '' and `` Mo Fire '' are the two worse tracks on this CD . `` Fireman '' is clearly an example of when people say do n't judge the CD by the 1st single , because if you did you would think `` The Carter 2 '' was terrible . Lil Wayne could have easily released `` Shooter '' , `` The Best Rapper Alive '' , `` Receipt '' or even `` Grown Man '' before he released `` Fireman '' . `` Fireman '' will definitely have you missing Mannie Fresh providing Mannie Fresh . `` Mo Fire '' is not even worth discussing . However , Lil Wayne rebounds very quickly by the time you get to Track 7 . `` Best Rapper Alive '' is definitely in the running with `` Shooter '' with my favorite song on `` The Carter 2 '' . Big D should be commended with his production and the clever use of the sample on this track . Before Mannie Fresh 's production would win over Lil Wayne 's lyrics . Now with Mannie Fresh no longer producing him and with his lyrical wordplay stepping up , Lil Wayne 's lyrics overshine the production . At first listen , `` Grown Man '' wo n't be one of your favorite tracks but the more you listen to the song that features Currency the track will be atleast something that you do n't mind listening to every now and then . It 's a contradiction to what Lil Wayne would usually make because usually he would make a song degrading women instead of making a nice rap song for the grown and sexy . `` Receipt '' is another one of my favorite tracks as once again , the proudcers on the track , Heatmakerz , makes a clever use of an old school sample and Lil Wayne takes care of the rest . The more you listen to the track you will definitely think that this track is dedicated to his boo Trina . `` Shooter '' was taken from a track by Robin Thicke entitled `` Oh Shooter '' that was on his debut CD . Robin Thicke incorporates his use of the song and Lil Wayne is still able to drop 3 verses to this track . The reason why this track is one of my favorites is because this track is different from what Lil Wayne is accustomed to doing . This track should be the next single , but we 'll see . Robin Thicke has a nice track out with Pharrell entitled `` I Wan na Love You '' . `` Weezy Baby '' is a very catchy track as Nikki lays down some nice vocals to this midtempo track . `` Get Over '' is catchy as well as Nikki returns to lay down some more vocals and Lil Wayne is actually able to bring some substance to his tracks instead of trying to win with clever metaphors . The track sounds like a dedication to one of his homies . `` Get Over '' is a nice change of pace because most of the tracks on `` The Carter 2 '' end up sounding alike.Other than `` Fireman '' and `` Mo Fire '' there are n't too many things wrong with `` The Carter 2 '' . There are times where the metaphors that he uses are n't as strong as the others and there will be times when you hear a song with tight lyrics and wonder how the track would have sounded with a Mannie Fresh beat . Some of the tracks sound the same but you can pretty much listen to every track on this CD.Cash Money may be on life support as a whole but Lil Wayne is doing his best to keep the label on his shoulders . If you liked `` The Carter '' then you should like `` The Carter 2 '' , even without the production of Mannie Fresh . If you liked `` The Block Is Hot '' , `` Lights Out '' and `` The Carter '' , then you will like `` The Carter 2 '' James ' Top 51 ) Tie Best Rapper Alive1 ) Shooter w/Robin Thicke3 ) Money On My Mind4 ) Fly In , Carter 2 , Fly Out ( Same Beat ) 5 ) Tha Mobb"}, "25478": {"id": "25477", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I was n't expecting the production on this album to be as good as usual ( without Mannie Fresh ) , but the production is suprisingly great .

I 'm not sure what exactly sparked this improvement , probably some combination of maturing as a man and MC ( you have to remember Wayne was VERY young when he signed with cash money , he was 16 when the Hot Boys debuted ) and just working on his writing and flow.Lil ' Wayne is now back with his latest offering , 'Tha Carter II ' , with the absence of Mannie Fresh , one of the key players in making 'Tha Carter ' such a good album . I anticipated this would really effect this album negatively , considering Weezy has never worked without Mannie Fresh altogether , and because Mannie Fresh is just a great producer in his own right . As I expected , Weezy is on point the whole album , but the production here is much better than I would have thought it would be . The Heatmakerz ( 'Tha Mobb ' & 'Reciept ' ) , T. Mix & Batman ( 'Fly In ' , 'Lock & Load ' , 'Grown Man ' , 'Carter II ' , 'Hustler Musik ' , 'I 'm A DBoy ' & 'Fly Out ' ) , The Runners with DJ Nasty & LVM ( 'Money On My Mind ' ) , Doe Boys ( 'Fireman ' & 'Hit Em Up ' ) , Yonny ( 'Mo Fire ' & 'Oh No ' with Matlock ) , Big D ( 'Best Rapper Alive ' ) , Robin Thicke ( 'Shooter ' ) , Deezle ( 'Weezy Baby ' ) & Cool & Dre ( 'Get Over ' ) all contribute beats in place of Mannie Fresh , and do a great job for that matter . The 'Fly In ' and 'Fly Out ' songs are sort of a continuation of 'Tha Carter 's 'Walk In ' & 'Walk Out ' , with 'Carter II ' being the 'Inside ' of this album . All 3 tracks have the same beat ( as did the ones on 'Tha Carter ' ) which features a great piano loop , and an orchestral part that increases in intensity as the verses go on.Lyrically , you definately get more than you would expect from Lil ' Wayne , but he still has a ways to go to become an elite MC . He 's one of the best in the game when it comes to punch lines & metaphors , and he has proved that he can carry an album , but he still needs to work on his subject matter , which is largely uninteresting and pointless . Another thing Lil ' Wayne has greatly improved over the years is his flow . He has perfected his trademark sloppy southern drawl , into one of the most original and interesting flows in the game . 'Tha Carter II ' finds Wayne even more mature musically and lyrically than on 'Tha Carter ' , and I think this is why I would give the edge to the sequel over the original , which I loved also ( But , 'BM JR ' still might be better than every song on 'Tha Carter II ' ) . But still , I highly reccomend both.Top 5 Songs ( In Order ) :1 . Shooter - A remake of Robin Thicke 's 2000 song 'Oh Shooter ' , and it might be one of the dopest songs of 2005 . Very original production , stuff you would never expect to hear on a rap album , and this is just a song anyone with an open mind should love.2 . Fireman - It 's the popular lead single , which often comes off forced and cheesy nowadays , but the great production and some of the best and catchiest lines from Weezy make this a banger.3 . Feel Me - Probably the best song lyrically , and just overall one of the best songs on the album.4 . Best Rapper Alive - Love the production , and another overall dope song.5 . I 'm A DBoy ( Featuring Baby ) - Great hype song with the drums sampling Eric B & Rakim 's 'Paid In Full ' . I do n't like Baby as a rapper any more than the next guy , he has a decent flow and goes well with this track.Worst Track : Mo Fire - Mediocre beat , annoying hook , and just not a very good song.Lyrics/Substance/Subject Matter - 8.5/10Flow/Delivery - 9.5/10Production - 9.5/10Overall Feel - 8.5/10Guest Apperances - Kurupt , Currency , Nikki & Baby - 5/10 - All of the guests only do hooks besides Baby , and they dont really play much of a role here at all.Overall Rating - 9/10 - If you liked 'Tha Carter ' , you 'll love this .

It was hard for me to adjust to a Cash Money release lacking Fresh 's infectious beats , but once I took this for what it is ( which is a Wayne release ; not Mannie ) , I actually began to appreciate it more than its predecessor.I wo n't lie , and say I followed Wayne before Tha Carter . The only time Cash Money ever appealed to me was through the Big Tymers ' I Got Work , as well as Juvenile 's 400 Degreez . I honestly did think Cash Money was a dead empire before 2003 , when Juvenile 's Juve The Great brought some mainstream spotlight back onto the label . Juvenile did n't have an extended stay on the label , but it did n't matter ; later that same year , Wayne picked up the ball , and ran with it , releasing Tha Carter . Tha Carter was built on Mannie 's beats and Wayne 's newfound flow ; Mannie laying the foundation to this complex , and Wayne building from there with his rhymes.I think all of us were worried when we found out Mannie severed ties with Cash Money , because Tha Carter 2 seemingly needed Mannie 's beats to once again cememt that foundation . However , Wayne did n't allow his house to crumble ; instead , he brought in a cast of underground , east coast producers , and created Tha Carter 2 ; arguably the greatest release to ever come out of Cash Money Records.The sound is nothing like previous Cash Money albums ; and that 's why it succeeds . With production handled by a handful of cats , they provide the perfect musical backdrop for Wayne 's unique flow . While Tha Carter was a great release , Wayne sounded a bit too comfortable flowing over the beats Mannie produced ; changing his enviorment like he did on this release brought out the best in Wayne . On The Carter , Mannie 's production sometimes overshadowed Wayne 's lyrics ; on Tha Carter 2 , they perfectly compliment them.This is a great album from beginning to end ; saying this will become a classic within the coming years would not be an overstatement at all . As it stands , it IS a Cash Money classic , and one of the best modern commercial hip-hop releases you 're going to find from any region . Wayne may not be the deepest of individuals , but he has a supreme way with wordplay , an infectious flow , and an ear for truly hot beats ; make sure to pick up this release if you 're a hip-hop head ."}, "25492": {"id": "25491", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "i first thought this cd was so overrated when everybody said this ( ... ) was the classic ... especially because of the fact that i did n't like fireman that much ... but i was wrong , this cd is the BEST cd of 2005 ! i do n't think he needs mannie fresh that badly , he got T-MIX and the DOE BOYS ( who produced the most of the songs ... ) the best songs are ...

More distinguishable than the previous Cash Money releases , but this time around it feels much more serious and actually like a complete record thats been taken time to fully create .

Theres More delivery , more punches , not bad for a southern artist like himself . THis is the direction he shouldve BEEN taking his skill of lyricism too , now all he needs to do is roll on with it .

I remember when they first came out , nobody knew what to make of them and they hardly got any positive press . Today , the tables have turned , as System Of A Down have become one of the most respected rock bands of the new millennium . You ca n't open up any music/entertainment magazine without seeing something about them . As of 2005 , System Of A Down have successfully infected the mainstream . And what a way to do so.The first handful of songs , `` Attack , '' `` Dreaming '' and `` Kill Rock N ' Roll '' do well to get the blood pumping , while not straying too far from System 's signature sound . The title track and first single , `` Hypnotize '' is one of the most simple , yet beautiful songs System Of A Down have written to date , and from there it 's a bit more challenging . I got ta admit , the first few times I listened to this , I was a bit indifferent to what I had heard . A lot of songs on here , such as `` Lonely Day '' and `` She 's Like Heroine '' ( which are Daron-dominant tracks ) simply are n't instant hits , but glue themselves to your brain after a while . However , severe adsurdity prevails in `` Vicinity Of Obscenity '' which will defnitely make you feel at home . The closing track , `` Soldier Side '' is a continuation of the opening track on `` Mezmerize '' and serves as an epic closer to this piece , and the perfect way to connect both albums . Because afterall , they are one in the same.Of course , everyone has preferences as to which part they like better . Personally , I 'm still stuck on `` Mezmerize '' and probably will be for a long time . However , put 'em together , and you get one hell of an album . Surely , they could have cut out a few tracks here and there and released this all as one album , but who cares . It was worth the wait and worth the money .

One of my favorite soad songs . It starts off very heavy with the fast drums and the melodic chorus makes it a great song.2.Dreaming 9/10 ... Definitely a song that grew on me . At first i was n't a big fan of it , but it has certainly grown on me . My favorite part is the middle with the breakdown and Daron singing.3.Kill Rock N ' Roll 8/10 ... Eh . Another Cigaro type fun song . But , it 's really only decent . Too hard to understand the message if there is one ... except for the grass part.4.Hypnotize 9.5/10 ... A more serious side of SOAD that i love to see . Such a melodic song and i love the intro into it.5.Stealing Society 8/10 ... Another decent song . The beginning is a tad annoying but it ultimately turns into a good song.6.Tentative 10/10 ... Probably my favorite song on the cd . Great lyrics and you ca n't beat the chorus or the bridge where the heaviness kicks back in . Good stuff.7.U-Fig 9/10 ... The beginning guitar is so cool sounding and then the song explodes . Serj owns the vocals all the way so it 's great stuff.8.Holy Mountains 9/10 ... A five and a half minute epic . Softer more melodic verses with eratic outbreaks of the chorus which is extrememly heavy and pretty fast paced . New ground for SOAD and a great song.9.Vicinity Of Obscenity 7.5/10 ... One of , if not the weirdest song every by System . I loved it , but it gets annoying quick and it 's kind of pointless.10.She 's Like Heroin 6/10 ... My least favorite on the cd . Just not good , Daron on vocals , it 's almost nauseating , kind of like Old School Hollywood without the guitar breakouts and the techno voice.11.Lonely Day 7.5/10 ... Eh . Another not so great song by Daron . Just kind of boring , and i ca n't get past the line `` the most lonliest day of my life . '' It does n't make sense , anywho , just ok.12.Soldier Side 9/10 ...

In addition to not being very far removed musically from `` Mezmerize , '' this album also follows about the same blueprint . The songs on `` Hypnotize '' are very corky and energetic . It combines jokes with serious , bold political messages , and heavy songs ( `` Stealing Society '' ) with slower , ballad-esque numbers ( `` Lonely Day '' ) . Plus , many of the songs have several tempo changes . ( `` Dreaming '' combines `` Chop Suey '' -esque singing with tempo changes that bring `` B.Y.O.B . '' to mind , and `` U-Fig '' and `` Holy Mountains '' are chaotic , off-the-wall tunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns . ) And , finally , guitarist/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than he did on the band 's first two albums . But most of his singing , here , is actually pretty good . ( Track one , `` Attack '' begins with fast , ultra-crunchy riffs , before Daron begins to croon nasally , and he actually sounds as good as Serj . ) There are a few throw away tracks on here . `` She 's Like Heroin '' goes absolutely no where , and `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' is so silly , it could be a `` Steal This Album '' b-side . But there are several more good songs than so-so 's , and there are a few mature moments ( i.e . `` Kill Rock ` N Roll '' and the title track ) , which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song.Upon my first listening to this album , I was not at all impressed . I thought System were trying to hard to be funny , but usually ended up coming across as goofy . Fortunately , however , I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot .

Needless to say I did n't rush out to buy Hypnotize . It kills me that they would put Daron Malakian in charge of a majority of the vocals when you have a truly incredible vocalist like Serj in your band . Serj made this band for me all those years ago and continues to be my favorite part of System Of A Down . However , after countless listens to not only Mezmerize , but also Hypnotize , I can honestly say that I 'm thoroughly impressed.System Of A Down have always been ahead of their time . Serj 's insane vocal-stylings boggle your mind at times , the lyrics are always strangely intricate , and the music never fails to get your blood rushing . Those things have n't changed a bit.Attack is the most reminescent of the older System stuff thanks to the excellent sing-along quality of the chorus . Dreaming shows Daron 's vocal ability off quite well , particularly towards the end of the track . Hypnotize has great dual-vocals with great lyrics and music . Tentative is one of the few tracks where Serj conquers the running time and , as expected , he commands your attention . Holy Mountains serves as the best song , along with Attack . The beginning is quite haunting until you get to the intense chorus . Vicinity Of Obscenity is your typical strange SOAD track , much like This Cocaine ... was on Mezmerize.My favorite songs are Attack , Hypnotize , Tentative , Holy Mountians , and Vicinity Of Obscenity . Hypnotize was far from an instant hit with me so if you 're anything like me and dismissed this after the first couple listens I definitely recommend going back and giving it a few more detailed listens .

Hypnotize is the perfect blend of blazing screaming crazyness that was very present in their self-titled effort and Toxicity , and the more safisticated blazing screaming crazyness that was Mezmerize . Anyone who had doubts of a band selling out when Daron Malakian started singing will have their doubts thrown right back at them . System Of A Down managed to blend both Daron and Serj voices perfectly into these group of songs , while perfectly mishmashing guitar crunching with well organized riffs . There 's not much more to it . This is the perfect combination of what System Of A Down does best . // 10Lyrics : Lyrically Hypnotize shines . Perfectly blended with very heavy symbolic messages and flat out screaming and noises , and no matter which on of the two it is , or somewhere in between , it will get your attention , and bury somewhere deep in your head . The riffs and lyrics will stick to you , a gift System of a Down has mastered , undoubtly a huge part of their massive success over the last couple of years . Hypnotize also sees the horizon broaden lyrically for System Of A Down . They tackle issues such as War , of course , with songs like Soldier Side , the continuation of the intro from Mezmerize , which sees the songs taken to epic proportions , one of the biggest sounding songs System has ever done . Not to mention the songs that are just down right crazy , like Kill Rock n ' Roll or Vicinity Of Obcenity , but System of a Down would n't be System Of A Down if they did n't load it full of symbolism . The one big surprise comes in Lonely Day , the only really personal song System Of A Down has really done , with lyrics like `` If you go , I wan na go with you , and if you die , I wan na die with you '' really touch a nerve that System has n't explored before , and they do it amazingly well . // 10Impression : It is no doubt that Hypnotize will outsell anything System of A Down has ever done , and it should . Mezmerize blazed the trail for this albums much anticipated release , and System deserve any praise that this album gets . They perfectly tweeked a sound that has driven them to the top , mixing what their self titled album and Toxicity did for them to be the one of the most respected bands in metal , and what Mezmerize has done for them to be one of the most respected band in music today . // 10"}, "25510": {"id": "25509", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This release is definitely better than the first half of System of a Down 's double-album project this year , the horrifically misguided Mezmerize . Hypnotize partially redeems the project with a generally stronger set of songs , but releasing the new material on two albums has had middling results at best . Like all double albums , this material could be boiled down to an incredible single album , but as a double it 's just bloated and unfocused . Eliminating stone-cold garbage like `` Cigaro '' and `` Old School Hollywood '' from Mezmerize , and `` Kill Rock n ' Roll '' and `` She 's Like Heroin '' from Hypnotize , would have made SOAD 's recent product look much more focused and hard-hitting.As for Hypnotize itself , SOAD 's strengths are exercised a little better this time , especially in a commanding trio of tracks in the center of the album & # 8211 ; `` Tentative , '' `` U-Fig , '' and the band 's most haunting look yet at the Armenian genocide of the early 20th century , `` Holy Mountains . '' Unfortunately , the momentum is then broken by the stupid `` Vicinity of Obscenity . '' Of course , the band uses such nonsense as an artistic statement , and they 've even done it successfully in the past , but here the point just does n't come across . Meanwhile , the useless `` Lonely Day '' proves why SOAD should not be doing ballads , though the full version of `` Soldier Side '' can nearly match `` Aerials '' as the greatest of SOAD 's powerful slow-burners . But the overall lesson of this double-album project is that the efforts of SOAD ( and particularly Daron Malakian ) to expand their sound are not leading to true advancements , with a real shortage of their former triumphs in breakneck songwriting and fearsome chops.Malakian has earned respect as an outstanding songwriter , but in his baffling drive to advance his own less-than-stellar skills on vocals and guitar , he is egotistically wasting the incredible talents of his bandmates . The relentless rhythm section of Shavo Odadjian and John Dolmayan has been pushed to the background , while Serj Tankian is now crushingly underutilized . Metal singers who can truly sing are terribly rare these days , and Tankian 's incredibly inventive phrasing and terrifying delivery make him one of the best ever at forcing the listener to really think about what he 's doing . It is downright insulting to watch Tankian be reduced to a fraction of lead vocals , and to have to listen to him singing backup to the far weaker vocals of Malakian , whose whiny and reedy voice is seriously damaging the power of SOAD 's material . In the future , Malakian must retreat back to his core strengths as a songwriter , so the band as a whole can exercise its incredible power once again .

It seems obvious , paying twice for a double album that actually coulda fit on a single cd anyway . But if you got them right when they came out you probably only paid like 9 bucks for each of 'em , so the monetary difference ai n't much of a concern . Still I think the consumer came out a little behind , not because we paid too much but because we got more than we needed . Simply put , when SOAD needed to come up with 20+ songs in a single session they came up with a few more clunkers than usual . ( A problem typical of most double albums and pseudo double albums ) So , finally meandering to my point , 'Hypnotize ' has 3 lousy tracks . 'U-Fig ' is mostly just bland and uninspired , other than the chorus which is truly grating . ( Though it 's worth noting that I 'm in the minority on this issue , as most people seem to enjoy that piece of crap . In fact I seem to have received psychic comeuppance for my denouncing of the track as I just poured soda all over myself . Back in a sec ) Sadly , 'U-Fig ' is quickly overthrown as the most irritating SOAD song as we arrive at 'Vicinity of Obscenity ' and 'She 's Like Heroin ' . Here SOAD 's goofiness gets the best of them and they churn out to hideous novelty songs for those who ca n't distinguish between what 's catchy and quirky and what 's simply annoying and ridiculous.Still , the other 9 tracks are good , often great . They retain the greater sense of melody they found with 'Mezmerize ' and incorporate plenty of harmonies , which I feel really augment their sound . Many hate Daron 's singing and while he is annoying at times I think he 's mostly acceptable and , again , works very well while harmonizing . The instrumentation is strong and energetic and though they are n't really a Nu-metal band the instruments still largely just provide a base for the vocals . There are a few neat riffs , but this ai n't a thrash album or anything like that . 'Attack ' is what you need from an opener , very energetic and driving though it still has SOAD 's trademark sudden starts and stops . 'Dreaming ' is perhaps the strongest track , with a great epic , harmonious chorus and strong dynamics . 'Tentative ' is the next best thing , huge and emotional and apocalyptic . 'Holy Mountains ' is the most ambitious , multi-faceted thing here . Not every instance of it works , but it 's very good overall . They get a bit more emotional at the end , with the simple power-ballad 'Lonely Day ' and the closer 'Soldier Side ' . This last one is perhaps a bit melodramatic at times , but they pull it off anyway and it 's a fine capper to the whole project.Still , it shoulda been only 1 album . Lop off those 3 track I mentioned here and combine it with 'Mezmerize ' minus 'Old School Hollywood ' , 'This Cocaine ... . ' and maybe one more relatively mediocre track of your choice and you 've got the best SOAD album of their career . But 't was not to be , and it 's not like anyone is making me listen to those tracks , so I suppose it 's no huge loss.Lastly , the way the packaging of these albums is supposed to combine is lame , but whaddya expect ."}, "25515": {"id": "25514", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Mesmerize seemed to be the transistion alblum this amazing alblum .

A huge change now is Daron 's and Serj 's voices are working together instead of separately this along with way more changes within in the song make this one of thier best .

I 'll buy myself an electric mandolin just to do that song .

In short it was much more than I expected . After listening to the entire album , I believe Hypnotize retains the heaviness from SOAD 's earlier albums but goes to places they have never been before . Mezmerize , I thought , was an excellent album that was unique because the band was expanding its musical boundaries . Hypnotize continues this expansion but in my opinion it is a lot better than Mezmerize . I believe this album will be the favorite of the 2 sets among the true System fans , but that is my opinion . So what is so awesome about this album ? 1.Attack- starts the album off with a bang , thanks to frantic vocals from Serj and alternating vocals from Daron.2.Dreaming- a bit less frantic than Attack , but it sounds like something from Steal This Album . very nice.3.Kill Rock n Roll- this song amazed me when I heard it at the concert in Atlanta . The studio version is even better . One of my favorite tracks right now.4.Hypnotize- we all have heard this by now . It is definitely a surprise because it is a different direction for SOAD . I love it though because it has a punk feel to it towards the end.5.Stealing Society- Daron and Serj alternate vocals on this one and it is crazy ! Might be my favorite overall at the moment.6.Tentative- slower than the previous tracks , but still a powerful song.7.U-Fig- excellent guitar work on this track.8.Holy Mountains- this track was floating around the net and sounded awesome . the studio version does it justice as it sounds excellent . slower type of song but very strong , I am impressed.9.Vicinity of Obsenity- this is the craziest song on the album . chorus repeats `` banana banana banana , terra cotta pie '' . It is hard to find the meaning of this track but Serj is all over the place in this one ripping it to shreds.10.She 's Like Heroin- Daron stars in this track . this is a terrific song , one of their best I think.11.Lonely Day- my least favorite of the 12 tracks . Dont get me wrong , it is a good song but it is so plain that a lot of people may not like it . Probably the slowest song from any System album.12.Soldier Side- WOW ! this track is unbelievable . It picks up where Soldier Side Intro left off on Mezmerize , and I think these are the most personal and emotionally strong lyrics System has written . It ends the album on a very high note , leaving you Mezmerized and Hypnotized over what you just heard.I hope this persuades some new listeners to check this band out . The true fans do n't need any persuasion . I have been a huge fan since the self-titled album and I am completely amazed by Hypnotize . If you thought Mezmerize brought them to new heights , you have n't heard anything yet ."}, "25519": {"id": "25518", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "First off , 95 % of nu-metal sucks , other than maybe soad , slipknot and flaw still hold my attention . This is an album worthy of 4 stars . Serj is a great vocalist . However , Daron YOU SUCK as a singer . I 've been a fan since the `` System of a Down '' album . Which is classic , along with Toxicity . The lyrics have also lost alot of serious value . It is alot of goofy and corny type stuff now . Which is alright but can get obnoxious at times . Also , I am not one to act holier than thou if I have been listening to a band longer than a few others . However , it is REALLY annoying to hear people who have only heard this album talk like they know everything about SOAD . So , please stop it . Song 's like Kill Rock N ' Roll , Hypnotize , Tentative , U-Fig , and Soldier Side make this album really good in fact . However song 's like Lonely day ( What is worse , Daron 's vocals or his sappy cheese filled lyrics ? ) just bring the album down . If you are new to soad and are impressed with this album , check out `` System of a Down '' and `` Toxicity '' to really be blown away . Also , look at the song `` She 's like Heroin '' Serj 's parts are great and make the song listenable , , then Daron 's singing is just God awful . Seriously , who gave this guy a mic ?

That 's only close to 76 minutes worth of music folks.While I like both releases ( though I feel that Mezmerize is the stronger of the two ) , I have to give this business decision to screw people by making them pay 28 dollars for 2 releases that could 've ( and should 've ) been put on just one CD just one star.Burn both CD 's onto just one 80 minutes CDR and listen to them all the way through from start to finish . It makes a very cohesive listening experience and makes the whole even stronger than the parts.I 'm surprised that more reviews on here have n't mentioned that SOAD are making people pay double for just 76 minutes of music.That bothers me , but then again , the albums ARE really good stuff and really catch the band in an incredible transitional period which really makes me excited to see where they go next.Hopefully the rumors of them splitting up are just that , rumors.I 'm a fan back from the beginning when they first came out and I think they 've just gotten stronger and stronger with each release ."}, "25522": {"id": "25521", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "After nearly 4 years since their last official studio effort ( not counting 2003 's `` Steal This Album ! '' ) System Of A Down boldly returned in May with their newest offering `` Mezmerize '' . `` Mezmerize '' proved to be well worth the wait , and when I heard that it would be the first part of a double album , the second part being released 6 months after , I was very excited . But after the excellent return with `` Mexmerize '' , where did that leave SOAD to go ? `` Hynotize '' clearly answers that question by being one of the best and most refreshing rock/metal albums of the year . Everything you 've ever loved about SOAD is fully intact on the release , and in fact is much better than it has ever been . `` Hypnotize '' is everything its predessecor `` Mezmorize '' was and more , making it a must hear for all fans.Opening up with the blistering anthem `` Attack '' , System of A Down ups the ante on all levels . `` Attack '' features amazingly well written lyrics about our government and its nact for attacking things that do n't necessarily need attacked , however it 's not just the typical `` no war in Iraq '' song . No SOAD relates how our own government could eventually turn around and just attack us all , because they could . The excellent lyrics of Serj and Daron 's lyrics are just as impressive as always on the release , something which I have always loved about the band . Songs like `` Kill Rock And Roll '' and `` Hypnotize '' are fairly different from anything the band has written before , and pieces like `` Stealing Society '' and `` U-Fig '' recall their roots from their Self-Titled album . Musically the band is on the same level as `` Mezmerize '' , which is not a bad thing at all . Daron gives a great performance on guitar , throwing out thrash inspired riffs in heavier tunes like the afformentioned `` Stealing Society '' and `` Attack '' , but is also capable of laying down soft and intricate portions on thought provokers like `` Lonely Day '' and `` Soldier Side '' . If you listened to `` Mezmerize '' you probably noticed Daron 's increased time on the mic , which is carried over into this album as well . His vocals are n't bad by any means , but Serj Tankian has always been the reason why SOAD had such a unique sound , and really I 'd like to hear Serj more than Daron . As for Serj 's vocals , there are great like always , showing his usual range of zany stylings evident through out all the top tracks like `` Attack '' , `` Kill Rock And Roll '' and `` Stealing Society '' . Shavo Odajian and John Dolmayan back the band in stellar fashion once again and propel the heavier the songs , and well as balance the slower ones . The album moves at a great pace , and is 12 actual songs ( `` Mezmerize '' was 10 songs and an intro ) so you have plenty to choose from . Standouts include `` Attack '' , `` Kill Rock And Roll '' and `` Stealing Society '' .In the end `` Hypnotize '' is everything I hoped it would be and more . This clearly surpasses the precedent set by `` Mezmerize '' , and is one of the best albums you 're likely to hear this year . In typical fashion there is a nice variety of SOAD tunes found on this record , and all fans of the band are going to find something about this cd to enjoy . The cover art is particularly cool , and the way it fits with the cover of `` Mezmerize '' is very well done . Like `` Mezmerize '' before it , it 's nice to hear a great band like System Of A Down returning to top form in a time where the original movement they were a part of has slowly died away . This proves that the band was not just a product of their time , but a band with the power to stay years after they debuted . `` Hypnotize '' is a testament to that . Having the heavy , catchy tunes that initially drew us to the band , slow and introspective pieces that give the album depth , and plenty of craziness and politically charged lyrics to satisfy the most hardcore fans , `` Hypnotize '' is flat out a must hear release this year .

Indeed , with the near death of that obviously baseless sound , System of a Down , unlike Korn , Limp Bizkit , Mudvayne , etc. , remains a Billboard behemoth because this Armenian foursome possesses a truly unique formula.The second half of its 2005 output , Hypnotize , to me , is much more of a logical step from Toxicity than the very good , yet still regressive , Mezmerize . Where that album toyed with a more tempered and simplistic formula , Hypnotize is a lethal dose of aggression and mayhem filtered through a refreshing maturity in the songwriting department.Possibly throwing a middle finger to the critics who question the musicianship of the group , Hypnotize contains System of a Down 's most impressive technical performance since its self-titled debut , hands down . I mean , in no way has this become a technical band , but the songs are far more dynamic , the time signature changes more frequent and complex , and the riffs noticeably more intricate . In fact , `` Lonely Day '' ( not one of my favorites ) contains a solo from Daron , which should put to rest the critique that he has limited ability while simultaneously highlighting the fact that he obviously does not believe in shameless self-glorification over song quality.And speaking of Daron , the primary songwriter for the band is featured more prominently on the vocals here , and though this has already tragically and predictably led to tabloid-maniacal fervor over the possible dissent in the ranks ( see aforementioned The Washington Post 11/20/05 article ) , Malakian 's added vocal role takes nothing away from Serj 's ability to command attention . Instead , the two attain a level of harmonization not present on any previous releases , and the result is SOAD 's most impressive vocal performance yet.This obvious cognizance and intent is what leads me to praise this release as a more fitting heir to the genius of Toxicity . I mean , I do enjoy Mezmerize , but that effort demonstrated standard SOAD originality , but no growth . With Hypnotize , you have the eerily composed and epic nature of `` Holy Mountains '' , the vocal oddities of `` U-Fig '' , the never attained before heaviness of `` Attack '' and `` Dreaming '' , and the ever-present intensity that was such a strength for Toxicity all coming together as evidence that this band has accurately identified its strong points , and is now ready to expand and exploit them.Whether it 's the to be expected quirkiness of tracks like `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' , or the cohesion of the title track , System of a Down has reaffirmed the widespread accolades it received for its monumental Toxicity . Retaining every bit of unrestrained fury and unmatched personality of that landmark release , Hypnotize also does what Mezmerize could not ; provides evidence that this is a band we have yet to hear the best of ."}, "25527": {"id": "25526", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "How many bands come out with two albums in one year ? `` Hypnotize , '' following closely behind the release of `` Memorize , '' is the stronger album of the two .

System of a Down is the culmination of those dreams . `` Toxicity '' is my favorite hard rock album ever .

They 're the most important band making music today -- better than Radiohead , U2 , or any other pretender , if you ask me . They are Hall of Fame material , if by then there is any justice regarding selection.Anyway , `` Hypnotize '' is n't quite as good as `` Toxicity '' , but it 's better than `` Mesmerize '' , with greater lyrical depth , fabulous songs , impressive musicianship , and terrific vocal harmonies . I 'm not going to dispute the fact that Serj 's vocals are better than Daron 's , but their tandem vocals complement each other well , adding a musical wrinkle they did n't have on `` Toxicity '' .

First , I find it amusing that when `` Mesmerize '' came out 6 months ago , everyone thought that it was great . Fast forward to now and the response seems partially luke warm with some being outright negative towards `` Hypnotize '' . I think had this second part to the overall album just been released as a double album , everyone would have loved it . Perhaps the band made a miscue by dividing the releases apart from one another ? Or perhaps System Of A Down has hit the beginning of their popularity downslide . This seems to be the case with any artist : once they hit their popularity peak , there 's nowhere to go but down . Granted , U2 has seemingly defied those odds by consistently releasing bad albums that the public herald as `` classic '' but for the rest of the bands on Earth , it 's all a game of how long they can stay atop the wave before they get sucked into the current.I 'll put it this way : `` Toxicity '' was truly a landmark album for this band . It not only made System Of A Down a household name but beyond the hype , it is an album of truly great songs . They established themselves an identity and broke far and away from the term nu-metal all in one fell swoop . Naturally , this album will likely always be their benchmark with most people and though it 's not their most creative album by any stretch , the strength of the songs solidified it as a truly classic album . With `` Mesmerize/Hypnotize '' , you might be able to scrape together a similar amount of strong songs between the two as you got with `` Toxicity '' by itself . From my perspective , System Of A Down has grown creatively and musically since `` Toxicity '' and the level of experimentation is obvious but in the end , they may have sacrificed the opportunity to `` strike while the iron is hot '' in terms of having songs the world will love.To that , I say who cares what the world wants . The world 's ( namely America ) music audience has a very short attention span and it always will . Though I think System Of A Down has hit a weird period in their career , I think the combination of creativity and songwriting is going to result in their best works in the future . Unfortunately , with some people seemingly already jumping ship , who knows how many people will still be around to enjoy it ."}, "25531": {"id": "25530", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "You people should stop your complaining immediatly !

Serj is n't as good as before either . It 's just different- In Mezmerize , when Serj and Daron sung together there was amazing harmony and counterpoint . In Hypnotize , sub-par.FINAL THOUGHT : The songs are n't that bad really ... it 's just that Mezmerize and Toxicity are too good ."}, "25534": {"id": "25533", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Well , after Mezmerize left me with a great , but ultimately far too small taste of the new direction System is now taking , I of course had to wait impatiently for this second half to be released . I loved Mezmerize , and aside from the somewhat mediocre `` BYOB , '' I thought it could compete face to face with any of System 's other albums . It was n't perfect , in my opinion , as it had some of System 's laziest lyrics . But it was still a shocking revelation of how much System has grown and matured . Instead of slowly deteriorating and giving in to the wishes of short-sighted marketing executives like almost every other band from this era of metal , SOAD continues to create art and progress . For a more in depth opinion of Mezmerize , I have written a separate review , but of course this is a review of Hypnotize ... .and to be honest , I was disappointed upon first listen . The songs just would n't gel for me , did n't grab me emotionally like the best songs on Mezmerize . But this turns out to be a bit of a grower ( albeit it a very fast one ) : three spins and I was hooked . Sure , it does n't resemble the self-titled in quite as many ways as Mezmerize did . But it takes those elements that Mezmerize brought back into the equation and develops them even furthur . The frenetic , progressive Mr. Bungle-esque time shifts and dissonances are more seamlessly combined with the melodic sentiments carried over from the Toxicity days to create a new sound of sorts . System is going forward and wo n't be looking back anytime soon.One major difference between Mezmerize and Hypnotize is variety - while Mezmerize had a more interesting variety of different sounds ( `` Old School Hollywood , '' `` Cigaro , '' and `` Question '' for example , ) Hypnotize shows a more cohesive sense of flow . Many of these songs are the same blend of addictive melody and old school SOAD punk-metal energy . This can work for or against the album , depending on your preferences . Either way , though , it splits this `` double album '' into two distinct albums . And all for the better ... who wants to sit around and listen to the same sound for 80 minutes ? Another major difference is this : Hypnotize is easily the darkest SOAD album since the self-titled . Even my friends who are n't particularely sentimental or over emotional when it comes to music say that this album does something to them ... it hits a nerve somewhere . A lot of the best examples are towards the end , like `` Holy Mountains '' which I see as being a far more mature successor to `` Ariels '' and one of the best songs on this album . After the comic relief of `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' comes the ungodly creepiness of `` She 's Like Heroin . '' Despite sloppy lyrics , `` Lonely Day '' is still a haunting melody . And of course there 's the full version of `` Soldier Side '' which sends chills down my spine still after listening to this album for a week.Even in many of the other songs , this emotional intensity can be found in assorted choruses and bridges . `` U-Fig '' seems to have a Dredg-like antsy quality to it and the apocalyptic `` Tentative '' foreshadows the too-close-for-comfort intensity of the last few songs on the album ( and at the same time manages to evoke the meloncholic vibe of Steal This Album 's better songs . ) The title track was the perfect choice for single , and it was the first song to grow on me . In many ways it is the oldest-sounding song and could have been a track off of the self-titled if it were not for Daron 's lead vocalizing . By the way , while I 'm on this subject , I would like to share my opinions on Daron 's voice ; many people seem to unfairly dismiss new System solely based on his voice . While I will admit that he does n't have the `` nicest '' or most well trained voice , I could cite dozens of worse singers in any form of popular music . He may not have the outright beauty of Serj 's voice , but he has style and energy that I think benefit this new direction System is going in . Besides , Daron is n't REPLACING Serj , the two voices are simply playing point and counterpoint . If anything , Daron-critics should like Hypnotize more because it has more Serj than Mezmerize did.People who complain that this album is n't enough like the `` old '' System need to stop being nostalgic whiners that are afraid of change . System of a Down have changed as a band , matured , developed - and thank God for that ! Had they stayed the same to appease the fanatics , they 'd be down the drain with all those other nu metal bands . I could n't be happier with the changes System has made . I will always have a place in my heart for the self-titled , it was my favorite album for a long time and I do n't think they 'll be able to top it in my book ... but I would rather they change and continue to become a different band that makes more cds that are great in their own unique way than drive the same formula into the ground repeatedly until I stop liking them altogether . In art , change is survival . Learn to embrace that concept , or be left behind - your choice ."}, "25535": {"id": "25534", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "2005 was the best year for new music I 've seen since 2001 .

It is a little bit of all the simple joys and terrors of this world packed into a 40-minute CD.Is this as good as Mezmerize ? It depends on what you 're looking for . Mezmerize seems more like a cohesive whole than a colleciton of songs ... but Hypnotize definately has some of that `` collection of songs '' vibe to it . However , the songs here are much more interesting and well-developed in my opinion . It 's scary just how good System of a Down has gotten at writing amazing pop songs . They have now reached a point where they can write a song with hokey-sounding lyrics on paper ( `` the most lonliest day in my liiiiiiiife '' ) that WORKS like nothing else and actually has an emotional impact . If you like pop , metal , rock , or just plain interesting music , this is well worth your time . Yes , it is fairly `` mainstream '' in terms of sales , but it sounds nothing like all those awful contrived fake-metal bands out there . Trust me : this is the real deal right here . From the sudden onslaught of `` Attack '' to the false calm created by the acoustic bits of `` U-Fig '' to the masterpiece that is `` Soldier Side , '' Hypnotize resembles a sonic orgasm.And yes ... in case you were wondering , Serj sings a lot more here than on Mezmerize .

In addition to not being very far removed musically from `` Mezmerize , '' this album also follows about the same blueprint . The songs on `` Hypnotize '' are very corky and energetic . It combines jokes with serious , bold political messages , and heavy songs ( `` Stealing Society '' ) with slower , ballad-esque numbers ( `` Lonely Day '' ) . Plus , many of the songs have several tempo changes . ( `` Dreaming '' combines `` Chop Suey '' -esque singing with tempo changes that bring `` B.Y.O.B .

But most of these songs are very good and there are a few mature moments ( i.e . `` Kill Rock ` N Roll '' and the title track ) , which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song.Upon my first listening to this album , I was not at all impressed . I thought System were trying too hard to be funny , but usually ended up coming across as goofy . Fortunately , however , I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot .

His voice is n't bad at all -- it just does n't mesh like Tankian 's masculine spasticness does .

I was totally blown away by `` Mezmerize , '' and I know it 's an unpopular opinion , but to me , that 's the best work they 've done . Every song on there is wonderful , and while it may not have been too serious , it was kind of refreshing to hear , and only two songs were actually political.Here comes the sequel to that one , `` Hypnotize .

The former is well-performed but to me seems like it was kind of written to be a hit more than connect with the band 's artistry . The latter has some of the band 's weakest lyrics , never getting in depth on what makes the day so depressing/lonely . A tale of a prostitute and drag queen on `` She 's Like Heroin '' is okay , but that 's not really one of my favorite songs from the group , either.This album is far more political than `` Mezmerize , '' but many of the songs deal with the Armenian genocide issues . The greatest songs , for me , do n't match with the other disc , but it is still pretty good . Not as quick and quirky as the predecessor , but songs like `` Stealing Society '' and `` Vicinity of Obscenity '' show the group has plenty of creativity in them and are totally exciting to hear .

That 's not to say they do n't have they 're similarities . Songs such as `` Enough Cryin '' and `` Gon na Breakthrough '' are heavy on the rap , both featuring Brook but that is n't a bad thing because both songs are really strong , funky and dancable hip-hop soul/funk . Same story goes `` About You '' with Will I Am and `` No One Will Do '' . One thing that might settle differently with other listeners about this album is the numerous lyrical references to what she 's `` been through '' and how she came over them to let us now about it empowered her . Not a bad thing at all on the surface but if your aware of Mary J 's career thus far it 's a concept she 's by this point long ago worn into the ground so she was more than repeating herself on that note considering that was the entire concept ofNo More Dramawhen you got right down to it . Three of the most impressive songs on this album are `` Good Woman Down , '' Ca n't Hide From Luv '' and `` Ca n't Get Enough '' -all of which showcase a strong grounding in the Chicago funk/soul style that grounded Mary J 's music in it 's 70 's based tradition for quite awhile at this point and they are part of the glue that holds this album together . On `` MJB Da MVP '' she 's actually looking back on her musical past and talking of how her career moves . And on we go to the last part of the album where her whole outlook comes to an important conclusion . `` I Found Everything '' brings in Raphael Saadiq in for a gospel/soul tune that owes a lot to Mary 's connection witht eh late 60 's Aretha Franklin Atlantic era recordings . `` Father In You '' and `` Alone '' again dip into the funk , not just in terms of music but against lyrical ideas about semi-Freudian relationships revolving around men . `` Father In You '' strikes a very important chord with me because how similarly it relates to someone I know who 's had similar experiences . Of course this also contains `` One '' , a duet with U2 and although it 's an very compelling hybrid of both of their dramatic musical styles .

Mary sings with so much soul and passion and you can really feel what she 's been through . Her vocals are also so soothing yet amazing , especially on songs like It Ai n't Really Love . Mary should keep up this fantastic work because I really feel for her . Also , her re-make of U2 's One ( in which U2 actually duet on the track with her ) is absolutely brilliant . If you were dissapointed with Love & Life , or even if you were n't , I strongly suggest you try out this amazing effort by one of the best R'n'B female singers of all-time ."}, "25551": {"id": "25550", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I have been a Mary J. Blige fan since her heyday in the early ` 90s ; in fact , I even remember when she used to sing backup for Father MC . But while her first four albums were great , her next two albums were kind of average . Also , as my brother said , her voice was starting to weaken . But as soon as I first heard `` Be Without You '' on the radio , I was blown away and I had a feeling she was making a comeback . And she does just that on The Breakthrough.There are great songs aplenty on here , so it 's hard to pick any one as the favorite . But introspective tracks duly impress , like `` Father In You '' and the motivational `` Good Woman Down '' . `` Baggage '' is also stellar , as it has Mary telling her man that she 's not bringing her problems to THEIR relationship or blaming him for them ( why ca n't MORE women say things like tha -- never mind ) .Other highlights include `` Take Me As I Am '' , the cover of U2 's `` One '' ( complete with U2 ) , and the Raphael Saadiq-assisted `` I Found My Everything '' . And while I never really cared for Mary 's rapping alter-ego Brook-lyn , the rap in `` Enough Cryin '' actually makes a great song even better . That always is n't the case , though , as evidenced by `` Gon na Breakthrough '' .There are n't many fast songs to be found on here , which is good because that 's what brought her last two albums down ; case in point : I did n't care for the hidden bonus track . And the musical timeline found in `` MJB Da MVP '' would be great if it was n't for the lazy sample of a sample ( it lifts 50 Cent 's chorus from Game 's `` Hate It Or Love It '' ) . The album as a whole is also a tad long at 73 minutes.But The Breakthrough is still great . Take heed , though : do n't buy this expecting another What 's the 411 or My Life .

Who else can say that they are one of the main reasons a lot of the up-and-coming Hip-Hop inspired R & B ; singers are cropping up and vying for your attention on the airwaves ? Everybody from Ciara to Ashanti to Teairra Mari to Nivea to whoever else you can name have one woman to thank ... .and she is STILL the reigning Queen of Hip-Hop Soul . Sure , she had her own obstacles along the way , both career-related and her personal battles as well . But like most strong Black women , she persevered and made due with what she had to get through . Failed relationships , overbearing producers , a demanding record label , and an equally anxious fan base all make up the huge undertaking that Miss MJB is left to handle . After a disappointing showing with Love & Life , Mary takes a step back and goes for broke with The Breakthrough , an album that undeniably puts her back on the right track.Track for track , Mary represents to the fullest . `` No One Will Do '' and `` Enough Cryin '' set the tone for the rest of the album . Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas makes a disheartening showing on `` About You . '' This is n't because of any bogus lyrics , but rather a verse that makes you wish he was still rapping like the Peas used to do on their first two albums ! Alas , we are talking about Mary J and not the man I 've deemed the Black version of Sideshow Bob . `` Be Without You '' was probably the best choice for a radio single , with `` Alone '' featuring Dave Young ( who sounds suspiciously like another crooner named Dave Hollister ) and `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' featuring Jay-Z as two of the best choices for follow-up singles . You know Mary had to represent for the struggle with uplifting songs like `` Good Woman Down '' and `` Take Me As I Am '' fulfilling those looking for an encouraging word or two . `` Baggage '' and `` Ai n't Really Love '' are the songs dedicated to the no good men out there . And besides `` Be Without You , '' the mushy stuff shows up on the fascinating `` Ca n't Get Enough '' and the captivating `` I Found My Everything '' featuring Raphael Saadiq.By no means does this review give you the whole picture , but I ca n't help but say that you 'd really be doing yourself a disservice by not purchasing this album . It 's probably the best album since the Mary album , and that 's really an understatement . Mary J.

Blige debuted in 1992 with her album `` What 's the 411 '' and her hit song `` Real Love '' . Immediately , she garnered tremendous respect from the critics and the fans . She was immediately named `` The Queen of Hip Hop '' . Throughout her career , she has always stayed on top of her game , recording wonderful R & B ; and hip-hop songs . Fourteen years later , she remains The Queen , and more amazingly , she has garnered more success this decade than in the 90 's . She has since been compared to legendary artists Aretha Franklin , Patti LaBelle , and Dionne Warwick.Her seventh studio album `` The Breakthrough '' is exactly that . She needs no more than the title to explain how amazing of an artist she is on this album . Through every song on this album , she writes , produces , and performs to the fullest of her capabilities . She places her personal pain , heartbreak , and trials on these songs . Compared to some of her past material , she shows much more maturity on `` The Breakthrough '' , which shows that she takes risks and tries to evolve as an artist . Her biggest risk is admitting her weak side in life . The best example is her hit single `` Be Without You '' , admitting that though her man treats her wrong , she ca n't stop loving him.Her performances prove that she is truly one of the best R & B ; artists of modernday . Few from this genre have matched or beat her . She expresses her emotions and heartbreak to the fullest , never holding back . She proves in this album that contemporary R & B ; can contain soul , not just grooves . Her collaborations fit the individual songs well : Brook , Will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas , Raphael Saadiq , Jay Z , and U2 . Her versatality shows that she can cross genres and still sound great . Surely , since many know how amazing of an artist she is , it is not necessary to explain any fuller of her talent.Therefore , `` The Breakthrough '' is an essential for any Mary J. Blige or R & B ; fan . This album is sure to please a variety of its listeners . ***Expect Mary J. Blige to receive at least six 2006 Grammy nominations : Best Contemporary R & B ; Album , Best Female R & B ; Performance ( `` Be Without You '' ) , Best R & B ; Song ( `` Be Without You '' ) , Best R & B ; Performance by a Group , Duo , or Band ( `` I Found My Everything '' w/ Raphael Saadiq ) , Best Rap/ Sung Performance ( `` Enough Cryin ' '' w/ Brook ) , and Best Pop Collaboration ( `` One '' w/ U2 ) ."}, "25559": {"id": "25558", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "When Mary J Blige 's new CD `` The Breakthrough '' arrived in the mail , I rushed to put it in the CD player .

In the first part of the CD , Ms. Blige bursts into love and affirmation for her producer husband Kendu with a catchy piano-based tune `` Be Without You '' and the heart-thumping `` No one will do '' . `` Gon na Breakthrough '' and `` MjB da MVP '' are feel-good songs that demonstrate Ms. Blige 's perfect sense of rhythm and dance vibes . At this point , one might have think that Ms. Blige has lost its emotional gravity but fear not - for `` Good woman down '' is a rip-roaring anthem to encourage woman to confront their abuses ; `` Baggage '' , `` Father in You '' and `` Ai n't Really Love '' illustrates her past heartbreaks and hopes excruciatingly . Ms. Blige gives perhaps one of her best performance in `` I found My Everything '' that captures the energy seen in legend Aretha Franklin . The song `` One '' with U2 summons our conscience to help our brothers and sisters .

Blige 's seventh studio album and it 's one of the best albums that the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul has released in quite some time . Mary is in love and she appreciates her man and she wants the world to know . The Breakthrough opens up with the soulful number `` No One Will Do . '' This song is followed by the up-tempo `` Enough Cryin ' '' featuring new female rapper Brooke . This is one of those classic Mary songs about a no good man . Mary has realized that we are all happy that she is happy and in love but the fans who fell in love with her really related with the Mary who sang about pain and drama.The albums first single `` Be Without You '' is a beautiful ballad .

She offers hope in this song . `` Take Me As I Am '' is an mid-tempo song with a real nice beat . The title `` Baggage '' makes one think this is a slow song but it 's actually a rather up-tempo song , which sounds a bit dated . `` Ca n't Hide From Love '' reunited Jay-Z and Mary J. Blige . Mary sounds a bit Aretha Franklin like in this song.It 's really great that Mary included `` MJB Da MVP '' on this album . This is Mary 's song that was released on mix tapes earlier this year .

Blige - The Breakthrough ( Geffen , 2005 ) Mary J. Blige may call herself `` da MVP '' but two years ago she was anything but . In the midst of the Alicia Keys and Beyonc & eacute ; phenomena ( two women who were inspired by Mary ) , her album , Love & Life , went virtually ignored and the fact that she reunited with Diddy did n't make things any better . However , with all three of those people out of the way , her new husband as manager , and `` Be Without You '' topping the charts , Mary truly broke through with her new album , The Breakthrough.Usually when we buy a Mary album , we say that dreaded phrase : `` It 's not her best but it 's better than her last album . '' We might have to say that again but do not underestimate the songs on here . `` No One Will Do '' starts the album off right while `` Father in You '' and the 9th Wonder-produced `` Good Woman Down '' holds up against all Mary 's other classics . Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , who were sorely missed since 1999 's Mary , reunite with Blige ( with help from the up-and-coming Avila Brothers ) and brings us the great `` Baggage '' and `` Ca n't Get Enough '' . But one song that trumps even those is the Raphael Saadiq-produced , Aretha-inspired `` I Found My Everything '' . ( Mary and Raphael on the same track ? Why have n't they thought of this before ? ? ) Second place goes to her remake of U2 's `` One '' , featuring U2 themselves , which proves that Mary can work well with almost anybody.I was n't feeling `` Enough Cryin '' or `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , both featuring her rapping alter ego Brook . Also , `` MJB da MVP '' is a mixtape cut that really has no business being on this album . And where 's the other Raphael Saadiq-produced song , `` So Lady '' ? I heard it before but it 's not on this album , at least not on the copy I bought . But there are n't too many bad things you can say for The Breakthrough .

You should already have this album ."}, "25568": {"id": "25567", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Sometime in 2005 , it was announced that Mary J. Blige was going to release a greatest hits package . But when the lead single Be Without You hit the airwaves , the impeccable reception led to her seventh studio album being pushed out instead . And what a wise decision this was , as it is easily Mary 's most solid release in the since the turn of the century . Not only does it feature excellent work by some of the biggest producers in the game right now ( Bryan Michael-Cox , Sean Garrett , Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , to name a few ) but the majority of the tracks also feature writing credits by Mary herself , giving most of the songs the personal touch needed to give them a sense of believability . `` No One Will Do '' is seen one of two ways : easily an album highlight , or just a boring opening track . Fortunately , I 'm leaning more toward the former as this song captures attention and features an excellent vocal performance . The lyrics are well written and fit perfectly with the beat and delivery . `` Enough Cryin ' '' keeps things going at about the same level of quality . Produced by Darkchild , this is one of the songs that has a fair amount of drama . Mary sings about leaving a relationship because she 's sick of crying over it . The bridge in particular is excellent . This song is also one of two that features Mary 's alter-ego `` Brook-Lynn '' rapping , and she actually sounds pretty good . `` About You '' featuring Will.I.Am is probably one of the least memorable songs on the album , which is a shame because it is not bad in any sense . With that said , it is possibly the weakest track on the album just because it tends not to stand out from the pack.On the other hand `` Be Without You '' is easily a highlight . Somewhat reminiscent of Mariah Carey 's `` We Belong Together '' , this song takes things a step further . It has beautifully written lyrics that are relatively deep , and the vocal performance is simply stunning . Although this album has several highlights , this is one of two songs that are on a level of their own . `` Gon na Breakthrough '' is one of the more upbeat tracks that adds elements of fun to the album to keep things from getting too bogged down with the deeper , more dramatic songs . This is far from the best song on the album , but it is definitely a welcome addition . This is also the second song featuring `` Brook-Lynn '' rapping , and again she sounds pretty good . `` Good Woman Down '' is a great song with a great message . Here , Mary sings about how hard it is to sit back and watch things that happened to her happen to others she loves , and telling us `` you ca n't hold a good woman down . '' `` Take Me As I Am '' brings us back into highlight territory , although this was one that had to grow on me initially . This song has Mary singing in the third person , describing her past and asking us to accept her as she is or not at all . This features one of the best vocal performances on the album . Mary 's voice is subtler than on other tracks , but it suits the beat and lyrics perfectly . `` Baggage '' is a song many can relate to , as it describes not wanting to hurt a new relationship with memories and issues from the past . Here , Mary apologizes to her husband for hurting him and assures him that it is only because of what others have done to her in the past , not because of him . This is probably one of a few songs that borders on being merely average , but the bridge almost entirely saves it . `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' is possibly the only song I truly do n't like on this album . Mary 's voice sounds strained in most places , and the chipmunk-type noises in the background only hinder things further . I do n't know what Mary was trying to do with her vocals here , but I really hope she does n't try it again . `` MJB the MVP '' is the song I was most worried about , as this type of song generally comes across as arrogant , and serves no real purpose . I was pleasantly surprised by how well this worked , and in fact it was one of the songs that stood out most on first listen . The song has Mary recapping her journey thus far , even going so far as to use lines from previous songs of hers . And strangely enough , it works ( except for 50 Cent 's part , but that 's brief enough that it does n't matter ) . `` Ca n't Get Enough '' is a nice mid-tempo that is a good addition to the album as a whole , but does not really stand out . Mary 's voice sounds great here , and the lyrics are really sweet . However , there are far better songs here , but also some worse ones . `` Ai n't Really Love '' is another album highlight , which contains the excellent message that `` a love that tears you down ai n't really love '' . The song has Mary reflecting on a relationship where her partner was distant . The vocals are subtle but full of emotion , thus elevating the song to highlight status . `` I Found My Everything '' is another sweet song , with a straight-forward message . The breakdowns in particular are what make the song stand out , although it is a great effort as a whole . `` Father In You '' has a darker sound , and describes Mary 's childhood without her father around . It features excellent production , and beautifully emotive vocals . This is another highlight that took a couple of listens to grow on me . `` Alone '' is one of those songs that is excellent when you listen to it , but is unmemorable when you think about the album as a whole . It 's really a shame because this is definitely a highlight , and should easily be a standout . Featured vocals by Dave Young only make the song that much better , as he has a great voice . Hopefully this song will stand out more the more one listens . `` One '' featuring U2 is the second song to be completely on a level of its own . Mary and Bono sound excellent together and this and `` Be Without You '' are easily the two best songs . The backing music is stunning , as are the emotive vocals and excellent lyrics . Lastly , there is the hidden track `` So Lady '' which does n't really help the album at all . It does not fit in with the rest although it is a decent song , and `` One '' would have been a much stronger song to end with.Overall Mark : 4.5/5Coming at a time when many artists were making exceptional comebacks ( Mariah Carey in terms of sales , and Toni Braxton in terms of quality ) , Mary proved that she could easily hold her own . It also disproved what many were starting to believe : that Mary was on her way out . Her previous two albums were decent but not her best work , but this one featured Mary back on top form . We can only hope that Mary continues making albums that meet or exceed the quality of this one , although it will be a difficult feat ."}, "25569": {"id": "25568", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 've had this disc since its release day back in December but honestly was so stuck on my favorite single , BE WITHOUT YOU that I had not listened to it in entirety till within this month !

On this album there are also some guest artists such as Bono , Raphael Saadiq and Jay-Z . It definitely seems to be one go one step further then her last .

On `` What 's The 411 '' Mary J Blige caught my attention because she used hip hop samples mixed with r & b ; to create a sound that I was n't use to . Tracks like `` Love No Limit '' , `` Real Love '' , `` Reminisce '' , `` Changes I 've Been Through '' , basically the whole CD , remained in heavy rotation for awhile . However , when Mary J. Blige released `` My Life '' in 1994 , I knew that I would be a Mary J Blige fan for life . This CD , 'til this day is my favorite CD of all time . At the most difficult time in her life , caught up with bad relationships , drugs and alcohol , Mary was still able to release one of the best r & b ; CDs I have ever heard . In certain songs , you could tell that Mary was crying for help and in others you could tell that she just wanted to give an honest perspective on various events that were going on in her life . Just as `` What 's The 411 '' could be , `` My Life '' could be played from beginning to end . There are n't many people who can release 2 CDs and have them be CDs that could be listened to in their entirety . `` I Never Wan na Live Without You '' is still one of my favorite slow jams of all time . In 1997 , Mary J. Blige released `` Share My World '' and that CD would end up being a new beginning for Mary because she was no longer working with Sean `` Puffy '' Combs on her CDs . However , Mary still kept things going with tracks like `` Everything '' , `` Seven Days '' , `` Love Is All We Need '' w/Nas , `` It 's On '' w/R Kelly and the title track . In 1999 , Mary J Blige pulled a switch on us with `` Mary '' . Mary J Blige turned in the hip hop and r & b ; sound and acted as if she wanted to be an adult contemporary r & b ; artist . She had a lot of ballads and midtempo tracks on this CD and some people were unable to relate to the Mary J Blige on this CD . However , once I heard `` All That I Can Say '' I knew that I would n't have a problem with this CD . `` The Love I Never Had '' is still one of my favorite Mary J Blige ballads and the duet with her former boyfriend K-Ci of Jodeci , `` Not Lookin ' '' , is still a classic in my opinion . In 2001 , Mary returned with `` No More Drama '' . She started the party with the Dr. Dre produced `` Family Affair '' , she was ready for a vacation on the Neptunes ' produced `` Steal Away '' and she definitely proved that she was ready to straighten her life out with the powerful `` No More Drama '' , where Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis sampled the theme song to the soap opera , The Young & The Restless . I also ca n't forget the Missy Elliott produced `` Never Been '' . After declaring that she did n't want anymore drama and even working with Puffy again on the `` No More Drama ( Remix ) '' , Mary decided in 2003 to work with Puffy on another CD , `` Love & Life '' . The CD was energized with the first single , `` Love At First Sight '' with Method Man and also featured other tracks that I enjoyed such as the Dr. Dre produced `` Not Today '' w/Eve , `` Ooh '' which sampled the same beat that ED OG & Da Bulldogs used back in the day on `` I Got To Have It '' , `` Willing & Waiting '' and the powerful slow jam , `` Special Part Of Me '' .Some people may not have enjoyed `` Love & Life '' as much as I have , so in 2005/2006 Mary J Blige is back with `` The Breakthrough '' . Some people also see `` The Breakthrough '' as a comeback CD for Mary J Blige . I ca n't see how that 's possible because every CD that Mary releases can be classified atleast as a quality r & b ; CD . There is no `` Emancipation Of Mimi '' going on here . Mariah made quality CDs and then for some years with `` Rainbow '' , Glitter '' and `` Charmbracelet '' she regressed . Mary J Blige has never regressed.The 1st single from `` The Breakthrough '' is `` Be Without You '' . Mary J Blige shows people that she never lost her groove with a track like this . Bryan Michael Cox and Ron Fair provide Mary with a nice midtempo/slow track and Mary takes care of the rest . `` No One Will Do '' is my favorite midtempo track on this CD as this sounds as if this track is a tribute to her husband , Kendu . If you want to try to capture `` The Breakthrough '' in one track , I would say that the one track is the Rodney `` Darkchild '' Jerkins ' produced `` Enough Cryin ' '' . Just like `` Soldier '' by Destiny 's Child was the unoffcial women 's national anthem of 2005 , `` Enough Cryin ' '' is definitely an early candidate for the unofficial women 's national anthem of 2006 . Mary breaks it down as she declares that she is finally ready to get out of the situation that she is in with this particular man . After all the time of being dumb and in love , she is ready to stand up for herself as a woman and declare enough is enough with lines like `` Do n't wan na play house no more , so dumb to think you gon ' marry me , I got to be out my mind , thinking that I need someone to carry me . '' Brandy might want to pull Rodney 's name out of the Rolodex and work with him again after hearing this track . Although , I am not a Black Eye Peas fan , WillIAm outdoes himself on the feel good track `` About You '' featuring Mary , Will and Nina Simone . Will creates a nice track and even when he raps he stays out of Mary 's way as she wants to talk about how this man has got her going . `` Take Me As I Am '' also ends up being one of my favorite tracks as this midtempo jam allows Mary to talk about the fact that people just need to let her be herself and accept her the way that she is in all ways and all aspects of her life . `` Baggage '' has Mary on another nice uptempo track as Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis are back to produce another track with Mary . Mary talks about why she acts certain ways in a relationship because of all the events that have happened in her past relationships . She also says that she does n't mean to make the one that she is currently with to suffer because of that . Vidal & Dre produce `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' which features Jay Z . The track would have been even better if Jay Z would have actually laid down a verse on the track , but Mary still makes this a nice feel good uptempo track . `` MJB Da MVP '' has Mary making her own song out of Game and 50 Cent 's `` Hate It Or Love It '' . Mary goes through different events in her career and although I wish that the actual remix of Hate It Or Love It with Mary and Game could have been on here , `` MJB Da MVP '' ends up being a nice substitute . `` Ca n't Get Enough '' sounds like an old achool uptempo song as Mary talks about how much she is enjoying her current situation with her man . `` The Breakthrough '' has a real positive vibe to it for the most part . It seems as if Mary J. Blige has let go of the majority of the demons in her past and that is definitely shown throughout this CD.Anyone that knows Mary 's CDs knows that she is going to have some tight ballads on it . `` Ai n't Really Love '' has Bryan Michael Cox back on the production . Mary sings about a situation that finally has her fed up and explains how she loves him but not enough to compromise her own love of self by wasting time in a one sided relationship . `` I Found My Everything '' is produced by Raphael Saadiq and even has Raphael on some background vocals throughout the track . This song sounds as if it 's something that would have appeared on Tony Toni Tone 's last CD , `` House Of Music '' . Mary has definitely added to her classic list of slow jams with this track . `` Father In You '' has Mary explaining the fact that since she did n't have a father figure in her life as a child , she expects that from her mate . This ends up being another one of Mary J. Blige 's powerful slow jams . At the end of `` The Breakthrough '' Mary J. Blige holds her own with U2 on `` One '' as her CD ends on a good note . There is also a bonus track after `` One '' as well . So do n't think that the CD is over after you hear `` One '' .Overall , Mary J Blige has another classic with `` The Breakthrough '' . Alot of people are saying that this is Mary 's best CD . Everyone is entitled to their own opinion . However , I 'll ask anyone who thinks that to listen to `` My Life '' one more time and that may change your mind . If you are a fan of Mary J. Blige and her CDs then you ca n't afford to miss out on `` The Breakthrough '' . Just as I was telling another amazon reviewer , Tony , Mary J. Blige 's `` The Breakthrough '' , Anthony Hamilton 's `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' and Jamie Foxx 's `` Unpredictable '' are going to be holding me down for awhile as far as current r & b ; music is concerned.P.S . Music listeners do n't be confused by Brook who raps on two tracks on `` The Breakthrough '' . She is actually Mary J.James ' Top 61 ) Enough Cryin'2 ) No One Will Do3 ) I Found My Everything w/Raphael Saadiq4 ) Take Me As I Am5 ) About You6 ) Ca n't Hide From Luv"}, "25578": {"id": "25577", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I have n't enjoyed a Mary J Blige album this much since her 1999 MARY album . This seems to be a really personal album for Mary , but in many of the songs she channels this into making anthems . The first single `` Be Without You '' is instantly catchy , classic R & B ballad . The first 8 tracks of this cd are amazing , notably the opener `` No One Will Do '' , the anthems `` Gon na Breakthrough '' and `` Good Woman Down '' , and `` Enough Cryin '' . On `` Enough Cryin '' and `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , Mary raps . They are hot songs ! I hope `` Enough Cryin '' is a single at some point . The latter part of the disc is much more ballad oriented , with some great ones like `` Father In You '' , `` Ai n't Really Love '' , and `` I Found My Everything '' . Overall a great cd !"}, "25579": {"id": "25578", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "`` The Breakthrough '' is Mary 's 7th album . She started off with the album , `` What 's the 411 ? `` , in 1992 . It was a brilliant combination of classic Soul and edgy hip hop and very personal lyrics that a whole generation could relate to . It was hyped to the skies and she was imediatly compared to Aretha Franklin and Chaka Khan . Her next album `` My Life '' would prove experts right , Mary was indeed the real thing and this P. Diddy produced album was almost as good as the debut . It was most of all , more vulnerable and deep . On third album `` Share My World '' she truly showed her potential to the max , This album was also fukl of good producers such as Babyface , Jimmy Jam/Lewis Jerkins and R. Kelly . On 4th album `` Mary '' she want back to just the classic soul and skipped the Hip Hop that her previous albums had been filled with , the album continued to be full of great producers and was also a success . `` No More Drama '' was released in 2001 , it continued the trend with great producers such as Pharell Williams and Jimnmy Jam/Lewis and was her most mainstream album to date . `` Family Affair '' and `` No More Drama '' were both hit sibgles . `` Love and Life '' was quite a dissapointment though , once again P.Diddy was back as the producer but this time around it was n't as good and most of the album had a sound of overproduction with beats and sound effects instead of just releasing a natural album where Mary could shine on her own . Now 2 years later her new album `` Breakthrough '' is released , read on to find out the conclusions.It seems like she 's been back with the great Jimmy Jam/Lewis , and Jerkins but even other producers are included . On this album there 's also some guest artists such as Bono , Raphael Saadiq and Jay-Z . It defenitely seem to be one go one step further then her last . The sound is a mix of Soul and Hip Hop and it will defenitely give you some surprises . The best songs are the emotional ballads , that she 's always been excellent on . Old fans should defenitely not be dissapointed . `` No One Will Do '' is one of the highlight . Is a emotional midtempo that reflects the perfect love , she admits `` I want no one but you '' . `` Enough Cryin '' is also a midtempo with piano backround , about infedelity . `` About You '' is classic soul/hip hop , Wil.I.Am . also feautures on this one . `` Be Without You '' is a highlight , another emotional ballad with piano where she shows heartache . `` Gon na Breakthrough '' grows on me . Another hip hopish song feauring girl rapper Brook . `` Good Woman Down '' is also about heartache and tough relationships I think . `` Take Me as I Am '' a great personal ballad , the title sais it all . `` Baggage '' a decent midtempo , that would look good on any album . `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' is hop hop and it feaurures `` retired '' rapper Jay-Z . `` MJB Da MVP '' , well this is quite a surprise , it got the same sound as 5O Cent 's `` Hate it or Love it '' and feautures lyrics from him on the hook . This version takes the price . On the hook she sais `` I 'm the soul hip-hop queen and i aint going nowhere , but you already know meHate it or love it '' I hope this one will be single released . `` Ca n't Get Enough '' is a decent old skool soul midtempo . `` Ai n't Really Me '' also a slow jam about bad relationship and infedelity . `` I Found My Everything '' a soulish duet with Raphael Saadiq . `` Father in You '' slow one too , but typical album material . `` Alone '' a duet with Mary and Dave Young . Last song is a cover/duet of U2 'S `` One '' but it also feautures Bono . This version is one of a few times I can admit that a cover was really well made and diffrent . A bonus track called `` So Lady '' between Mary and Saadiq also appeares as track # 17.Overall , very well made , both in the production and the the songs included . You 'll get emotion , uptempo , Soul and Hip Hip and even some very nice collaborations . 2-3 songs here have the potential to becoma shart toppers . Having said that , this is a exellent album that fans should n't be dissapointed with at all . Great job Mary ! .

Stand out songs include `` NO ONe Else '' , `` Enough Cryin '' , `` Father In You '' , and the remake of U2 's `` One .

Blige 's THE BREAKTHROUGH is clearly one of Mary 's strongest albums EVER . Mary J. Blige becomes extremely personal on this album , much more so than her 2003 effort LOVE & LIFE . While LOVE & LIFE was a good album ( though some critics called it one of her weaker efforts ) , THE BREAKTHROUGH easily trumps LOVE in almost everyway.First , Mary J. Blige had some slight pitch issues on LOVE & LIFE . Here on THE BREAKTHROUGH , Blige 's voice is much better in tune while still keeping the same raw emotion that she has within her powerhouse vocals . In fact , in a growth that has stemmed since Blige 's debut album and the emotion she showed on the exceptional `` I 'm Going Down '' ( from her second I believe ) , Blige 's vocals have grown more and more emotional with a greater coarseness that provides for a great texture on her recordings . In fact , Blige is one of the few artists that continue to build herself better and better with each substantial recording . Now , with THE BREAKTHROUGH , she has reached the pinnacle.What is particularly fantastic about THE BREAKTHROUGH is the fact that Blige is n't afraid to admit she has her faults or that she has n't lived a perfect life . Most of her songs have blatant titles such as `` Baggage '' or `` Take Me as I Am '' . Even more sweet or real ( however you perceive it ) is her love songs and `` poetry '' that is directed towards her husband music producer Kendu , where she has such songs as the exceptional `` Ca n't Get Enough '' , `` I Found My Everything '' , and arguably , `` Father in You '' . In another exceptional cut , `` Good Woman Down '' , Blige tells the story about her father being abusive to her mother very powerfully . It is themes such as these that make THE BREAKTHROUGH ever more credible.Not only does THE BREAKTHROUGH stand on its own two feet where topics of interest are concerned , the production is among the best for any R & B ; album of 2005 . On The Jay-Z featured `` Ca n't Hide From Love '' , a neat sample is used mixed with a deep bass line , well produced drum programming , keyboards , and of course Blige 's powerful vocals on top of it all . Furthermore , acoustic piano lines are laced throughout the album on tracks such as excellent first single `` Be Without You '' . Furthermore , some of the risks taking with sampling provide yet another vehicle of excellence to this already exceptional affair . `` About You '' brings late jazz diva Nina Simone to the mix with a sample of her most famous song `` Feeling Good '' . To make the use of that sample even greater is how Blige wonderfully harmonizes above Nina 's low register , smoky vocals . Furthermore , the exceptional `` I Found My Everything '' sounds so similar to Aretha Franklin 's legendary recording of `` You Make Me Feel ( Like a Natural Woman ) '' in its overall timbre and soulful feel . In fact , on several occasions , you can clearly hear the influence of Aretha Franklin on Mary J. Blige as Blige very successfully keeps the spirit of soul alive throughout this album.There is no true filler material on this album , which is shocking for an R & B ; album . This will definitely be a Grammy Nominee for 2007 . This is honestly one of the best R & B ; albums of 2005 , period . Well done Mary . 5 stars ."}, "25588": {"id": "25587", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "To the Mary fans who 've been avid listeners of her music since 1992 's 'What 's The 411 ?

Diddy '' Combs ; that album was proof that earlier collaborations by Blige & Combs were much better , and that for future reference , Blige should never again do an ENTIRE album with Diddy .

This has got to be the very best R & B ; release of the year.Lead off single has got to be the very best R & B ; song of the year , or the past few years for that matter . A stunning mid tempo ode to love , in the mould of her 1997 hit ` Everything ' , featuring delicate piano , lovely backing vocals , and her fiery vocals.Opening track is the hip hop/soul of ` No one will do ' , a lovely midtempo breezy horn laden number . The piano sprinkled Darkchild produced ` Enough cryin '' is a fiery riposte at players who lead girls on and leave them high and dry , and her telling him she 's through with him and his games.The hip hop laced ` About you ' features Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas and the haunting vocals of Nina Simone ( yes ! ) courtesy of a sample of Simone 's 'Feeling good ' . ` Good woman down ' attests to the strength of woman , even when oppressed by menfolk. ` Take me as I am ' is a stirring lush midtempo number . The lilting midtempo ` MJB da MVP ' chronicles the different stages of her career and has her dropping names of her hits . It also features a rap from 50 Cent . A highlight on this disc. ` Father in you ' is a moving ballad that laments the lack of a father figure in her life , and her plea for her man to be that to her . Brilliant ! ` Alone ' is a brilliant retro sounding duet with Dave Young that would make Marvin Gaye proud.Her stirring remake of U2 's ` One ' starts off similar to the original , with Bono even providing vocals on the first verse , then Mary taking it from there . Her phrasing is different and builds to a crescendo towards the end . Bono and Mary have recorded together before , on Kirk Franklin 's 1998 Grammy nominated 'Lean on me'. ` So lady ' is a neo soul style number similar to UK duo Floetry 's style , and featuring lyrics about how her man makes her feel so much like a lady ( she now wears make up and high heels because of him ) . This is a bonus track on the UK edition , as is the last track , the funky guitar driven ` Show love ' featuring fiery vocals.One of the best releases ( of any musical genre ) of 2005 !

There 's also something to be said for the fact that she 's managed to attain and sustain her success without resorting to stripping down to her bikini.I have immense respect for the woman on so many levels . I think it 's clear that over the years , she has grown not only as a recording artiste but also as a person . She 's obviously happier than she 's ever been and this comes through on this latest work . All in all , ( especially when compared to what else is available out there ) , it 's a decent body of work . I 'm not going to bother with individual songs as I think other reviwers on here have said all that needs to be said . What I will say is that after the relative dullness of her last few CDs , Mary J. Blige can rest assured that her crown is safely back in place . The queen of hip-hop/soul/r & b ; is back ! However , it 's my opinion that reviewers who suggest that this is her best work to date , or that it can be compared to `` What 's The 411 ? '' or `` My Life '' just could n't possibly have been there at the time . Those two albums in particular , were events . The songs , the videos , the Puff Daddy club remixes , the drama ... it was a phenomenon the likes of which we are never likely to see again . Mary J. Blige may well go on to produce a CD that will outsell her first two albums - maybe she already has done - but I sincerely doubt that she ( or any other artiste for that matter ) , will be able to replicate the impact that she had when she burst onto the scene in the mid-nineties . My friends and I still feel something today when we play her early stuff and we 're talking well over 10 years later . Will or can the same happen with this one ? I guess we 'll just have to wait and see.With all that said , I still think `` The Breakthrough '' will be a must-have for most ( if not all ) Mary J. fans and it will definitely introduce her to new a brand new and wider audience as well .

The best is `` Baggage '' where she apologizes for bringing all her emotional drama to the relationship and `` Father In You '' is superb classic soul where Ms. Blige thanks her husband for the ways he has made up for her absent father . `` Good Woman Down '' she plays the role of mentor to young woman who went through the troubles she went through . `` I Found My Everything '' is a straight-up anthem with an exuberant vocal .

The other part shows her giving advice to her female fans to leave their abusive man in Good Woman Down and Take Me as I Am . The most heartfelt is Father In You , as Mary sees her current husband as her father figure instead of her own father . This has that feel of one of Aretha Franklin 's late '70s ballad hits -- just has that Aretha-esque vibe to it . Note -- Some songs will have you crying , especially Father and Good Woman Down -- the pain is so deeply felt from Mary 's voice . Mary can sure be singing it -- her soulful singing is so good over the hardest hitting beats and rhythms on it . I was going , `` Sing it , girl ! or Sing it Mary ! '' on several of the best songs . I love the orchestra on the Raphael Saadiq assisted I Found My Everything . From his band Toni ! Toni ! Tone ! to this -- man , I do n't know how this guy does it with coming up with these wonderful soul/R & B songs for others ! Take Me As I Am uses the same sample Jay-Z used on his own hit from '96 , Dead Presidents , but a little slower and stark groove . One other surprise is her with U2 doing an update of their '91 song , One . The band sounds fabulous with Mary and Mary and Bono sound so good together . But the band lets Mary do most of the singing here . How smart for U2 to take some time off their hugely successful world tour this year to record a song with Mary J for this album .

The first one was for `` Share My World '' a project that COMPLETELY changed my mind about Ms Blige . That particular proejct was a milestone - The Breakthrough ranks right up there with Mary 's absolute best.I have become so proud of her persona and how she has literally blossomed . While there were projects between the two mentioned above that were less than stellar , Mary definitely exudes maturity and enrichment in her delivery and her attitude . Moreover , the woman is doing as much as she can to convey that to youung women and for that I applaud her ! ! The Breakthrough , as far as I am concerned , only has ONE cut that I may have rethought - the duo with Bono is so-so but because the rest of the project is positively phenomenal , you can forgive/overlook an indulgence.This is hip-hop for grown folks .

There is , no doubt , that the singer poured all of her considerable vocal and songwriting talents into this most personally revealing and musically satisfying album . Co-writing no less than eleven of the listed sixteen songs ( there is a `` hidden '' bonus cut included at the end of track 16 ) , Blige is a spokesperson for women , as well as a `` therapist '' that can give good counsel to men as they deal the topsy-turvy relations game.On an album wherein all the cuts are outstanding , my favorites include `` Enough Cryin ' '' , a triumph of writing , Blige 's trademark forceful vocal performance , brilliant orchestral arrangement , and extraordinary background accompaniment ; `` About You , '' featuring Will.i.am and legendary Nina Simone , is another brilliantly orchestrated track ; the poetic `` Be Without You '' ; `` Good Woman , '' a thought-provoking and toe-tapping message to the young sistahs ; and the double-threat of `` Take Me as I Am '' and `` Baggage '' . `` MJB Da MVP '' chronicles Blige 's triumphant fourteen-year ( and counting ) career , expressing the singer 's highs and lows , as well as her appreciation of her fans.There are not enough superlatives that can be heaped upon `` Ai n't Really Love . '' This is the kind of song that Aretha could 've done in her prime and , obviously , the `` Queen 's '' scepter has been passed to Mary.The gospel-influenced `` I Found My Everything , '' co-written by featured vocalist Raphael Saadig , has a Prince-thing about it , musically and lyrically . `` Father in You '' is sheer perfection in more ways than one as a tribute to fathers and strong men.And the last ( credited ) cut with U2 ( `` One '' ) demonstrates that Blige can hold her own ( and on occasion , overpower ) the best on the world 's musical stage.Another bonus of the release is the breathtaking photography and attire of the singer.Blige has never looked sexier and more captivating.Mariah Carey best be glad that this album was not released earlier in the year.Mary J 's `` emancipation '' is far superior to `` Mimi 's '' !"}, "25604": {"id": "25603", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I love the music of Mary J.

Another highlight on this CD is MJB Da MVP . This song is about the ups and downs of Mary 's life and career in the music business . It is a great dance track . Be Without You is another gem on this album . This is a heart wrenching hit song about missing a loved one . One is a very strong track too . Bono and Mary sound great singing together .

All the great additions and great breakthroughs/comebacks have been something to see , but still there was that one lady who needed to finish it . Well December 20th brought it , a day that you are glad to be alive for with Biggie dropping a classic album after his death , Four Brothers-one of the best movies of the year- coming out on DVD , and Mary J. Blige dropping another standard setting album . The Breakthrough shoots right up to the top , right there with Mariah 's Emancipation . The soul and passion of this woman and the trials that you can tell she 's been through is unmatched . It really shows in the music on this album . You ca n't really find a bad track on the whole cut , although it slightly slows down a tad in quality after the first ten tracks to me ( to ME , might be different for you ) . The album starts off great with No One Will Do , stating that she has come across someone that surpass every other man she 's been involved with ( beat is kind of off-kilterish throwback soul sample ) . Very nice ! Enough Cryin ' and About You are collaborations with a couple of rappers . Enough Cryin ' is an uptempo hip hop track that features a pretty good female rapper called Brook and About You has Will.I.Am who even though Black Eyed Peas done went more crossover pop than anything is still a good rapper that 's on a track that discusses revealing true feelings about the person being involved with . Be Without You , no need for too much on that . A great single to show off the album that has really started to burn up the radio ! Gon na Breakthrough is one of my favorite cuts on the album . An uplifting feel to it that makes you just want to dance your day away . She could be talking about just dropping your stress away or breaking through to a special person and taking them to levels of love they 've never seen . Either way , it 's a lovely track ! Good Woman Down is a track that shows how far Mary has come . Going through so much , she is now at a point where she can teach these young ladies today how not to make the same mistakes or go through the same misfortunes she has . She is a teacher now through the trials and tribulations of love . I like the little background deep sigh of relief on it too . Take Me As I Am is talking about whoever she comes across to take her as is because the things she has gone through has made her , good or bad . So it would not be right to try to make them another person . You either want her like that or you do n't really want her ( a track a lot of people could really take something from or relate to ) . Baggage is another favorite of mine . The beat is a standout . If you ca n't bob your head to it or tap your feet , then I do n't know about you . And the words , on point ! Ties to the previous track in that she has been through a lot , so she carries a lot of hurt and lessons from previous relationships that she may unintentionally hurt her current one . But at the same time , she says there is no denying her love . It 's just she 's confused . Wow ! Ca n't Hide From Luv is another favorite ! It 's a throwback soulful jam ( faster pace track ) . Jay-Z makes a cameo on it , although I wish he could have put a verse down . It would have made it even better . But it is still tight ! MJB Da MVP was put out earlier this year in the spring . It is a sort of remix off of Hate It or Love It . I loved it then and I love it now even though again I wish they would have put the version of her and The Game on it . Ca n't Get Enough , Ai n't Really Love ( about not being love if you are trying to bring a person down , words really hit home with some people I see ) , and I Found My Everything are really good songs as well . ( Side note : Add Ca n't Get Enough to that string/run of great tracks . It was a good track when I first heard it , but now I really love it after hearing it a few more times . Ai n't Really Love as well . ) Father In You is a track about men being a sort of father figure in there ladies ' lives , whether they had one or not but more so if they did n't have one cause they need that comfort and sense of security . Alone is a collabo with someone called Dave Young in talking about not being able to do the relationship alone and both parties having to work at it , which ties into the nice finish-up with a track with U2 called One in both parties becoming one as in tying together to be one ( one heartbeat ) . How ironic in that her and U2 tied together to make this great song in both of them being kind of different genres of music . I really ca n't find anything wrong with this CD . The criticism I would have is that Jay-Z and Game could have made their appearances , the little dip in tracks 11-13 ( Side note : Again , that was my opinion first , not now ) , and it might be a little slow for some other people ( Hip Hop Soul , people ! ) . But criticism might be stretching it . The production and sound were excellent ! Her voice shows again why she is one of the greats of all-time R & B . The Breakthrough is truly an outstanding CD that Mary has put together . Possibly could be her best one in years ! This puts a wrap on the year of 2005 , the best and most prosperous year for the female R & B industry . From Destiny 's Child to Mariah , Keyshia to Fantasia , Amerie to Brooke , Faith , and now Mary J . Go out and cop this album ! You will only do yourself a disservice if you do n't !

Blige who created a new genre onto itself . But unlike her imitators , Blige has something they do n't , soul . While they relay too heavily on the hip-hop the reason Blige has stayed on top is that she finds the right balance between that and soul . Mix that all together with the heartbreak that seem to seep into most of her songs and you have a recipe that 's worthy of a first ballot into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Even though Blige declared No More Drama on her last album , luckily for us the listener , there is still enough to fill her latest album , The Breakthrough . The drama of finding , and keeping , a good man are at the center of Enough Cryin ' , Baggage and Father in You . And the music does n't faulter when she migrates into more traditional love songs such as No One Will Do , About You , and Ca n't Get Enough.Very rarely does the hip-hop beats drag down the album except on the bongos on Ai n't Really Love overpower the song . But Mary does sample both old school and new school tracks . As for new school , Mary builds MJB da MVP around 50 Cent 's chorus from Hate it or Love It . Then on Gon na Breakthrough Blige sings overtop KRS-One 's Step Into a World ( Rapture 's Delight ) .Then instead of settling for sampling , or even bringing in studio musicians , she gets U2 to make an appearance on the cover of their classic One from Achtung Baby . They even brought along a choir which helps convert the song into a gospel song much like they did on I Have n't Found What I 'm Looking for on Rattle and Hum . Mary even outshines Bono , who trade verses , and hits the line `` Love is a temple , love is a higher law '' like she finally found what she 's looking for .

'Love Changes ' flows perfectly after 'Ai n't Really Love ' , and 'Do n't Worry ' is a great as a bonus track following 'So Lady ' .

Jay-Z 's contribution to Ca n't Hide From Luv is kept to a minimal appearance on the introduction and even 50 Cent is ushered into a low-key role for MJB Da MVP ( in fact a rewritten and remixed version of the 50 Cent and The Game collaboration Hate It Or Love It ) .Having performed the song live together on stage in 2005 , U2 's appearance on One lets the Irish rock stars toy with the original arrangement of the song while adding Blige 's strong range where Bono 's ragged voice no longer goes . The funky bass and synthesizers of Baggage are reminiscent of past Mary J Blige glories , Take Me As I Am is an autobiography of hardship and Good Woman Down once again finds the gifted soul singer penning tough anti-violence lyrics.An affirmation of her strengths , The Breakthrough proves Blige is still an R & B ; heavyweight . As she notes on MJB Da MVP `` I 'm still glad to be here and my music 's still sincere '' .

Not . Just a couple of ad libs . But the song is still a hot , uptempo jam . 5/5MJB da MVP - Technically the first single of the album , dropping in early 2005 . A rundown of MJB 's career and life .

By October , word came up of a greatest-hits but that soon was shot down when it was announced that there would indeed be a new album of all new Mary J. tracks and it arrived just in time before the year was over.In the scheme of things , Mary decided not to trust Puff Daddy on this latest , her seventh , in what has been a strange yet beautiful and amazing fourteen-year career , and it was the best decision the Queen ever made because this album is ten times better than `` Love & Life '' was . Not to knock it but it held Mary back , I think . Finally on `` The Breakthrough '' , she let it all out and to good effect.In some of the tracks , she shows why she will always keep hip-hop as a medium for her to express herself , but in others , she brings nothing but straight up soul music and you ca n't do nothing BUT feel it . And then in others is so self-explanatory you just got ta let it groove . Possibly one of the hottest albums to come out in the last bit of the year and entering 2006 on a high , Mary J. answered to those who thought she had totally forsaken her craft of singing her pain in her music . Songs like `` Enough Crying '' , `` Good Woman Down '' , `` Take Me As I Am '' , `` Baggage '' , `` Ai n't Really Love '' , `` Father in You '' and `` Alone '' shows that she can still bring out drama ( no pun ) and emotions like no one else in this day and age.There 's also tracks that 'll make you get off your seat and do the wop ( `` Gon na Breakthrough '' , `` Ca n't Hide From Luv '' , `` MJB Da MVP '' and the hidden song , `` Show Luv '' ) , and there 's songs that 'll make you tell your lover everything ( `` No One Will Do '' , `` About You '' , `` Be Without You '' ) . While she hits on a rare social number with `` One '' featuring U2 , she actually turns the classic 1992 rock ballad by the Ireland boys and makes it a soulful opus . It 's cool Bono let Mary handle the rest of the song . But it 's the soulful Aretha/Natalie/Motown-inspired Raphael Saadiq-produced ballad , `` I Found My Everything '' that proves Mary is what she 's worth in hot buttered soul rather than the cookie cutter R & B ; that 's out now.Overall , Mary J.

The first single `` Do n't Bother '' is definitely not a stand out by any means , and does not define the sound of this album .

However , when you browse through the reviews you 'll notice how highly rated Oral Fixation Vol . 2 is . Every good thing said about this CD is true , it 's fantastic . I was a skeptic but was so struck by Do n't Bother that I did decide to get it . A lot of CDs nowadays take a few listens to really start to appreciate what you 're given , but with Oral Fixation Vol . 2 it only takes one listen and you know that you just listened to one of the finest pop albums of the year . Personally , I ca n't find a track I do n't like , each one is exactly what it should be . This is the CD Laundry Service should 've been . I know Shakira fans believe that CD was really good but I thought Shakira 's voice was the only thing that really set it apart from the rest . But with Vol . 2 , Shakira sets a new standard for this genre.How Do You Do is a nice introduction with a hip hop-esque beat in the verses yet changes to rock in the choruses . I have n't seen that done in a lot of music so I 'm a fan of it and that scores points with me . It helps that it 's an insanely catchy song though . Do n't Bother earns it 's spot as the lead single . I do n't really know how to explain the feel of the song but the chorus is very catchy in the sense that you feel like you 've heard it before . Illegal is a lot slower than I expected seeing as how Carlos Santana is featured on guitar . A lot of his songs are upbeat so , naturally , I figured Illegal would follow in the same vein but no , it 's got almost a lounge feel to it . The Day And The Time is another slow song but in no way sounds like Illegal . It does have a catchy little 80s type hook to it so that 's a nice touch . Animal City is destined to become one of the best songs featured . Animal City moves away from the slow ballad-like songs and is a real toe-tapper complete with Spanish horns . The chorus is very original and memorable and will no doubt get stuck in your head . If I were forced to pick a low point on this CD I 'd pick Dreams For Plans , but that 's only if I was forced . It 's got all the ingredients for a wonderful song , but somehow falls short . Even when Shakira is n't at the top of her game she 's still considerably better than any other pop singer though . Hey You is a nice happy go lucky track that deserves a listen . Your Embrace is a gorgeous ballad . It 's basically just a song to a lover , as any ballad is . Costume Makes The Clown picks up the pace in a huge way with extremely spiteful lyrics and nice use of guitars . Costume.. is a personal favorite , though I 'm sure there 's a lot of people who are sure to disagree . Something is another slow song that features good lyrics and lush melodies , so no complaints there . I 'm glad Shakira rounded out this CD with the upbeat Timor . It makes great use of sound effects , 80s-esque beats , and even a choir . There 's no song I could think of that could close this CD better.My favorite songs Oral Fixation Vol . 2 have to offer are How Do You Do , Do n't Bother , Illegal , Animal City , and Costume Makes The Clown . Whether you 're lured in by the sexy cover shot or simply by Shakira 's music , you 're bound to find a few things you like about this CD . If you were let down by past releases of Shakira 's yet saw potential , what you 'll hear on this CD is Shakira grasping that potential and wringing out every possible drop of good music ."}, "25627": {"id": "25626", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Latin superstar Shakira gave the other chart hitters a run for their money with her No . 1 international smash '' Hips Do n't Lie , '' considered by many to be the song of the summer .

Oral Fixation is a brilliant release and definitely lives up to the instant smash that `` Hips '' provided Shakira .

Very pretty and almost sounds like something from the 1980'sHips Do n't Lie - just added to the album ... Shakira successfully did what the likes of J . Lo and Mariah have always failed to do when collaborated , she made Wyclef Jean assimilate to HER style of music , as opposed to her doing a hip hop number .

I kind of expected that it would n't measure up to her past ones ( DELL and PD ) . Although it was a little too synthesized for my tastes , I did enjoy it , and continue to do so.With Oral Fixation Volume II , I was surprised by a couple songs . I expected that this CD , too , would be a little more pop or polished than I wanted , but having that in mind I think I came out satisfied.I absolutely love the first song , `` How Do You Do . '' Personally , I 've grown up in a very conservative religious family and it 's been hard for me because I 'm not that way by nature , and so the friction that is there has caused some problems in my life and I 'm trying to breakaway from it a bit . This song is WONDERFUL in regards to that because it deals with religion , more specifically the idea of God . Often it seems to many that God is just this mysterious figure that 's in control of everything and does n't really care ... this song is written from a questioning point of view , almost as a challenge of sorts . It deals with questions like `` If God is so good , why is there pain and suffering , '' etc . It makes you think and also services to maybe burn some of the frustrated energy off you have concerning the topic of religion and God.I really enjoy `` Animal City '' because it 's got a very exotic feel to it mixed with some great lyrics to back it up . I think in this song Shakira is kind of trying to dispense some type of nostalgic wisdom thru a bit of playful cynicism . I love the line `` 'Cause it 's an animal city , it 's a cannibal world , so be obedient , do n't argue '' She 's extending a warning in order to spare someone some pain while at the same time being a little bit sarcastic and dark . `` Dreams For Plans , '' simply put , is a song about real love . Not just skipping thru a flowery field love or GOD this world sucks love , just real . Seeing that things change over the months and years and you can either abandon it or work on it and upkeep it . `` Timor '' is a wonderful song lyrically ! I love how she 's pointing a light on American democracy and what a joke it is in some ways . This song is very political and very idealistic , which is what I LOVE about Shakira , it harkens back to her old says on Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones.Overall I 'd say that the reason I 'm most impressed by this album is the lyrics rather than the sound . There are the token cliche songs and the remakes of songs from Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral Volumen I that I do n't really like ( except `` Something '' is ok ) .

Shakira seems to do her best in her native tongue ( Spanish ) and her English singing does seem slightly more strained ; not quite as natural sounding as the Spanish . Still she does a more than admirable job in English and this album is better than 90 % of the stuff out there . There are n't a lot of artists who can be a success in music in two languages , so it is is noteworthy that she can pull it off . It 's also somewhat amazing that non-Spanish speakers enjoy her Spanish only albums a great deal , even though they may not understand a word of what she is singing .

Shakira had an unique formula : great voice , sexually suggestive dance moves , a successfull recording career in another language and she was a blonde latino girl . This formula helped her sell 13 million copies of Laundry Service and become one of the breakthrough acts of 2001.Then in 2005 , she returned with two albums : Fijacion Oral vol.1 and Oral Fixation vol.2 . Effectively this release of two different albums by her in one year garnered her acclaim and force-fed hungry fans with new music . I do n't own Fijacion Oral but I own Oral Fixation . Compared to Laundry Service , this album is more mature , far more , and contains no Spanish lyrics.I first thought that Shakira had lost some of her 2001 magic , when I listened to this album but after further observation I realised she had just matured , hugely . She has swapped her looks for her honest lyrics and superb voice.I really like the first single Do n't Bother , but there are some other gems on here as well such as : Timor , How Do You Do , Costume Makes The Clown and Animal City.Shakira seems to have invoked her spiritual side on this album , the first murmurs on this album are a part of The Lord 's Prayer.Shakira is more of a true woman than her previous manufactured latino sex-symbol self . She even dismisses her previous self on Costume Makes The Clow with this lyric : `` Told you I felt lucky with my humble breasts , well I do n't . `` Oral Fixation vol.2 features guest appearances by Carlos Santana and Gustavo Cerati , but this really is Shakira 's album.She is trying to come to terms with who she is and learning to love herself.2005 was a great year for music and a highlight of that was this album 's release . Oral Fixation will sound 'fresh ' even twenty years from now . At just over 42 minutes I would have liked to hear just a little bit more of Shakira , maybe 55:30.That way I would get more to satisfy me until her next album rolls around.Overall , Shakira 's latest album is more of an interview with the woman than anything else , she lays everything down on the table from her goal setting to her annoyance at the situation in East Timor . She reveals things we never thought she would , Shakira in a new light .

This is a fantastic , upbeat album , which proves Shakiras undoubtably the worlds greatest Spanish language artist.I 've marked it a 4 simply because there were a couple of other songs on Vol 1 I would liked to have had translated and I feel that Vol 1 had even stronger material ."}, "25639": {"id": "25638", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "The cover featuring Shakira 'Eve & The Original Sin ' is a classic theme that basically attributes to Even one more reason to bite the forbidden fruit-that would be her oral fixation : That 's Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll , Latin America 's most successful pop female crossover artist and my fav , I rave for Shakira ! She sways so provocative with the most sexiest dazzling flare but thats how she grew up dancing as music flow naturally in her veins . Her Hips do n't Lie is number one song in my Chart followed by Hey You and Illegal with the classic Carlos Santana playing on sexiest guitar strings . Hips do n't lie is Rapped vocals from Wyclef Jean and Shakira 's familiar Spanish-accented is rocking , Dance like this ... .very groovy . The way she rolls her back and moves her hips , well it 's a workout all in itself in its latest video of Hips do n't lie . How do you do is just a bunch of questions we wonder as human beings . Animal city chills with inventive moments with her loud vocals too good to resist . Overall , I 'd say - Laundry Service was Great but Oral Fixation Vol 2 ( included Hips do n't lie ) is Best of the Best and *Five Stars* A more matured and focused Shakira who is much in touch with a woman inside her - delightful to the sense . A must Pick . Just Chill ."}, "25640": {"id": "25639", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "`` How Do You Do '' , one of the highlights of the album , questions what God is all about . She asks `` What language do you speak , if you speak at all ? '' and wonders what he thinks about what is going on in the world today , in his name , when she sings in the second verse , `` How many people die and hurt in your name ? Hey , does that make you proud or does it bring you shame ? `` , while saying `` you 've made mistakes/well , that 's okay ` cause we all have '' . It does n't slam god or a higher being , but asks questions I 'm sure we 've all thought about at some point when it comes to religion . She asks `` Are you happy ? Do you ever cry ? `` `` Do n't Bother '' is another great one , an ode to her boyfriend , or soon-to-be ex boyfriend , however you want to look at it . She tells him not to worry that he 's leaving her for another woman because that woman is better than she 'll ever be . She says `` Do n't bother , I 'll be fine/I wo n't die of deception '' while at the same time challenges him when she sings `` I 'm sure she does n't know how to touch you like I would/I beat her at that one good '' . I think this song portrays how someone would feel if this happened to them . It 's basically the hurt , the anger , the acceptance , the questioning all in one . `` Illegal '' , which features Santana , is a song about her being so hurt and betrayed by someone that she starts to think it should be a crime to deceive a woman . `` The Day and the Time '' was featured on her spanish album `` Fijacion Oral Vol.1 '' , as well as the song `` Something '' . They 're nice tracks , nothing too amazing here.With `` Animal City '' , I do n't like the chorus , but the lyrics in the verses are amazing . She sings about fame ( `` They believe you now have everything you wanted/and once you have become a star you got no right to bitch/But someday when you fail they 'll put you on sale and buy you by the inch '' ) and fortune ( `` Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich/ And now like maniacs they scratch your back even when it does n't itch '' ) . `` Dreams For Plans '' and `` Your Embrace '' are nice , but once again nothing to spectacular . However , `` Dreams For Plans '' is really growing on me . `` Hey You '' is one of my favorites on the album , where Shakira sings about how she 'd do anything for the guy she 's with , and how it 's an offer he ca n't refuse . I love when she sings `` I 'd like to be the owner of the zipper on your jeans '' . `` Costume makes the clown '' is another good one , where she 's singing about how fame has changed her , and not in a good way . When people treat you a certain way and dress you up a certain way , you start to act like that person , which is the message I think she 's trying to convey . `` Timor '' is my second favorite song of the album ( behind `` How Do You Do '' ) . It 's about our ignorance of the world around us . She sings sarcastically about how the `` good '' guys are in power and the bad guys are in jail , and how we 'll be okay because we live in a democracy and can vote . Basically it 's saying , as long as we 're okay and everything is going good around here then that 's all that matters , and not say , the genocide in East Timor.Whew ! Anyways , I do like her first English album ( Laundry Service ) a little better , but it 's still good nonetheless . One complaint with the album is that I wish she 'd had more songs on it , because there are only 11 . And I do n't understand Spanish at all ( even though I took it for three years in high school ) , but Fijacion Oral Vol.1 is a good album that 's worth checking out ."}, "25641": {"id": "25640", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Shakira looks so great as Eve holding the apple on the cover to her newest album .

Even when the album dives into pulsating neo-disco , it 's in the form of a protest song in the closer , `` Timor , '' which is n't exactly by the numbers pop . And that 's a short description of Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 in general -- it 's pop , but it 's unconventional.Shakira sings about everything from love to religion , stopping along the way to reveal that women with 24-inch waists may indeed be heartbroken . If some of these ideas do n't necessarily gel , at least Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 is alive with ambition and , more often than not , Shakira winds up with music that is distinctive as both songs and recordings . And that means that Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 is not only a markedly different album from Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral , but from every other record in her catalog -- or , most importantly , from any other pop album released during 2005.Other artists may be bigger than Shakira while others may make more fully realized albums , but as of the mid-2000s no other pop artist has attempted as much and achieved as much as Shakira , as this often enthralling album proves . [ Oral Fixation , Vol . 2 was reissued four months after its original release with a slightly different sequencing and two new tracks : `` Hips Do n't Lie , '' which features Wyclef Jean ( who shouts out `` Shakira '' every 20 seconds or so ) , and a Spanglish version of `` La Tortura , '' a song from Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral ."}, "25644": {"id": "25643", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Shakira is a wonderful lyricist , This album is one of the best written i 've heard in a long time and it 's filled with wonderful beautiful reflective ballads .

This fine Colombian lady has a unique singing voice and I am glad to see that she is still getting the recognition that she deserves in the Western Anglo Saxon world of popular music ."}, "25646": {"id": "25645", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Just months after her all spanish album Fijacion Oral vol . 1 Shakira is back with her English conquest Oral Fixation vol . 2 , a great album from the Latin singer . Shakira is back with her 'acquired taste ' vocals , bringing a powerful punch for those who want to listen . What has Shakira done to step it up since her 2001 successful effort `` Laundry Service '' ? Well , most notably she has stepped it up lyrically . Also , in my opinion her voice has only gotten better , though like I stated before , he vocals are an ` acquired taste'.Things start off on great notes , such as the questioning religion track `` How Do You Do '' and the full fired lead single `` Do n't Bother '' . Sure , on paper `` Do n't Bother '' does n't look like much , but when in action it 's great . By the third track it 's reached one of the two best numbers with `` Illegal '' ft. Carlos Santana . Everything about the song is perfect , lyrically it 's superb , vocally she 's never been better , and the whole mood of the track is so laid back you could rest a baby on it.The second track to take top honors would be `` Dreams For Plans '' . Everything from the instrumentals to the lyrics are beautiful . And though it 's a `` say goodbye '' song , one will put that aside and instead smile at the elegance of it all . Also , one can enjoy songs such as the unique `` Animal City '' , the funky `` Timor '' , and the seductive `` Your Embrace '' where Shakira harps `` Tell me what 's the use of a 24 '' waist/ If you do n't touch me '' . So what exactly brings this album down . Easy , `` Hey You '' is just plain bad . It 's irritating to the point I had to skip to the next track . And though not horrible , `` The Day and the Time '' ft. Gustavo Cerati can get just plain boring.However , only two tracks are lacking the quality in which the rest of the album does more than make up for . So anyone who is a fan of Shakira should pick Oral Fixation vol . 2 up . Shakira has really outdone her self as an artist in her career . She 's gone from dominating Mexican Air waves , to dominating America in a style all to her own . Congratulations should be given to such a loyal artist who despite mainstream ways , has never changed hers ."}, "25647": {"id": "25646", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "It 's been a long wait , her first English speaking album `` Laundry Service '' was released in 2001 , 4 years ago and she joined the group of `` Latino '' singers like Ricky Martin , Marc Anthony and later Thalia and Paulina Rubio that successfully took the big step from the Latin to the global market and recorde a english album that become a commercial success . On `` Laundry Service '' she gave us many hits `` Whenever Wherever '' being the catchy uptempo top single , self penned `` Objection '' giving some tango influences and `` Underneath Your Clothes '' proving she was good on ballads too . Her English debut album , did have spanish songs too , something that `` Oral Fixation vol 2 '' does n't have . No , earlier this year she recorded a spanish speaking album with the suitable title `` Fijaci & oacute ; n Oral Vol 1 '' that entirely had songs in Spanish , it was a good message to her old fans from Latin America , that her priority was still them , it was her first Spanish album since 1998 . `` La Tortura '' feauring Alejandro Sanz was a massive hit all over Europe just the same . However , hearing her recording a follower to `` Laundry Service '' is far more exciting to me , since it is obvious that whatever she records in Spanish will sell well all over latin america anyway ( and also in other countries ) . One thing that I was surprised with her 2 Oral Fixation albums though is that none of the songs appear on both albums , it 's almost like 2 completely new albums in the matter of a few months or a double album released in 2 rounds , which is pretty amazing.So , does she follow up her success with this album ? Defenitely . This album is both strong , catchy and interesting . The major diffrence between her happy dance-pop debut is that many of the songs are very serious , still cathcy pop but the lyrics deal with subject such as faith , politics and relationships . The music itself is a mix of adult contemporary pop and latin dance vibes . On `` How Do You Do '' which is bound to became a massive hit , there are church choirs used , kind of like Enigma . It 's a rock song and it 's cathcy as hell . `` Do n't Bother '' is almost equally good , it 's about a competiting woman that think she 's better then others cause she looks and acts like the `` perfect '' woman . Shakira even goes as far as saying `` For you , I 'd give up all I own , And move to a communist country '' . On `` Illegal '' Carlos Santana appears with some great guitar riffs . The song is about sadeness from a relationship `` You said you would love me until you died , And as far as I know you 're still alive '' . Another highlight here . `` The Day and the Time '' feautures Gustavo Cerati , it 's a catchy midtempo . `` Animal City '' starts with her trademark hymns like on `` Whenever '' 4 years prior and it 's very spanish influented musically `` 'Cause it 's an animal city , It 's a cannibal world , So be obedient , do n't argueSome are ready to bite you '' , I think it 's about how celebrity status can be bad for a relationship and the animals symbolizes people that want to destroy it for you . `` Dreams for Plans '' is another love song in a very slow pace though . It feaurues accostic guitars and feel like typical adult contemporary music . `` Hey You '' got this catchy starts with horns . it 's a little jazzy , the hook reminds me of Petula Clark 's `` Downtown '' . It 's a odd number here . `` Your Embrace '' is another romantic ballad , starting verse sais it all `` Tell me , what 's the use Of the twenty-four inch waist , If you do n't touch me ? Tell me , what 's the use again Of being on TV every day , If you do n't watch me ? '' `` Costume Makes the Clown '' It 's another rather diffrent number , it starts very rocky and seems like a mix of rock and powerballad . `` Something '' is a slow number . Almost Katie Melua . The Closer `` Timor '' is one of the best songs , it 's very unique for 2 reasons . It sound like some Neo-Disco that Kylie Minogue would be proud of , and it 's a protest song . `` It 's alright , it 's alright , The planet 's split in three 'Cause I 'll keep on selling records , And you 've got your MTV '' This part sais it all.Overall , This is a fantastic album that proves that the 4 years away were well spent , it offers you meliodic pop-rock with some latin influnce but always focus on good lyrics and worhtwile hooks apart from beats and over-productions that others have done . Possibly one of the best if not the best pop album this year . Wether it will sell more then certain other pop artists , Shakira has archived much more by proving that she 's a fantastic pop singer that can both make good albums in english and spanish and that she was far from a `` One Album Wonder '' with Laundry Service '' , If you like traditional pop music that is rich on variation , lyrics and melodies here you have the one album to buy for christmas .

How many pop artists have been as experimental and artistic as Shakira is here ? A lot of the material here would n't sound out of place in a Tori Amos album ( from her old good days , that is ) and Shakira 's thorough and powerful form of protest here ( on songs like `` Animal City '' and `` Timor '' ) is deeply political and never put-on . Also , she knows how to talk about love , in ways few artsts can . She is as revealing and erotic as she wants to be , sounding light years ago from the sappy-or-crude dilemma of modern pop and much closer to Liz Phair than Britney . `` How Do You Do ? '' a torrent of worry and doubt addressed to God is chillingly brilliant , powerful beyond belief . If her previous work ( and the two translated songs from it here , `` The Day and the Time '' and `` Something '' ) was all about hooking up and reaching happiness , this is the opposite , an album on what happens after the happy ending , full of bitterness and irony . `` Do n't Bother '' is a bitter ( albeit addictive ) meditation on the status of modern relationships , sung from the position of `` the other woman '' . `` Illegal '' , featuring Carlos Santana , is a typical but effective heartbreak ballad , but it 's the theatrical rocker `` Costume Makes the Clown '' that drives the point home . `` I 'm taking the makeup off my face/before I forget my own features '' , she sings right before tearing her lover apart . `` Dreams for Plans '' is another of these tracks , describing the way time affects people and relationships . It is a heartwrenching elegie on disorientation , change and alienation , and Shakira 's description is frighteningly accurate.Shakira alternates with surprising agilty between hunter and prey . On the sexy `` Hey You '' , she challenges someone in every way , whereas the delicate ballad `` Your Embrace '' features a fragile Shakira craving for her loved one.Shakira has never done better than this , using her mouth to pray , express , cry , protest , kiss and speak freely .

It is amazing that her lead single from her first release of 2005 , the Spanish-language album FIJACION ORAL , VOL . 1 , `` La Tortura '' did so amazing on the pop radio . Furthermore , the album did n't do bad itself scoring a large scan for a Latin album . Now , Shakira returns with her English Language ORAL FIXATION , VOL . 2 , which is of course the second album of the double album.Shakira remarkably on ORAL FIXATION , VOL . 2 sounds very similar to Canadian Alt-Pop singer Alanis Morissette . At times , you could even mistake Shakira to be Alanis because like Alanis , Shakira has the unique bends and inflections within her vocals . It is definitely a unique voice that sits very well in the production for the most part , but , at times Shakira slightly overdoes the inflections and they grow grating . Again , for the most part , Shakira 's unmistakable vocals are right on and are as sensual and sexy as `` La Totura '' was on FIJACION ORAL , VOL . 1.There is very little filler material on this album , which for the most part leave genuine hits . The production throughout this album is especially well done as Shakira incredibly crosses over between latin and U.S.A. pop on such songs as the concluding `` Timor '' and the trumpet-influenced tracks of `` Animal City '' and `` Hey You '' . At other times , Shakira sounds more pop-ish with tracks like the incredible `` Dreams For Plans '' , `` Your Embrace '' , or great first single `` Do n't Bother '' . Unfortunately , this songs may not end up being as popular as her sexy Latin hit `` La Tortura '' was , but they all make for a very nice rounded pop album .

Deep lyrics in a pop tune . `` The day and the time '' is the english version for `` Dia especial '' , taken from `` Fijacion oral vol 1 '' and it is as great as the original . `` Hey you '' and `` animal city '' are singles in potential and mix the latin rhytms with lousy guitars , a style always present in Shakira songs.Well , Shakira has taken a long road since the beginning of her career in Colombia.Even though Shakira has become one of the most popular singers in the world , she is still very down to earth , always concerned with the quality of her albums , which improve everytime she goes back to charts .

Still , listeners expecting an album full of soaring vocals and syrupy romance as showcased on last summer 's magnificent `` Fijacion Oral , Vol . 1 '' will be surprised by an album characterized by many different themes and styles.The oddity is that `` Vol . 1 , '' which was a completely Spanish disc , debuted even higher on the Billboard chart , scoring the best sales week for any non-English album . Also , lead single `` La Tortura , '' the slick , sexy party record featuring Alejandro Sanz that was unstoppable through the fall and became the most successful Spanish single ever released , peaked far higher on the Billboard Hot 100 than `` Do n't Bother , '' the lead single from `` Vol . 2 , '' which fizzled at # 42 despite an impassioned performance , catchy hook and lingual advantage . Still , the English disc is a rarity among pop music ; it is experimental and interesting.The ball starts rolling with the hair-rising `` How Do You Do ? , '' a track that has been cut from the album in the Far East do to its outrightly calling God to task . `` How do you do ? /How does it feel to be so high ? /Are you happy ? Do you ever cry ? /You 've made mistakes , well that 's okay ` cause we all have/But if I forgive yours , will you forgive mine ? `` She also breathes new life into `` Dia Especial '' from `` Vol . 1 '' with `` The Day and the Time , '' which tells the tale of a stormy relationship that triumphs over obstacles . She perfectly recaptures the mood of the original incarnation and sings like her very life depends on it , much like she does on the heartrending ballad `` Your Embrace . `` `` Hope it is n't too late to say I love you/Hope it is n't too late to say/That without you this place looks like London , it rains everyday/Do n't you know it babe , I 'm only half a body/Without your embrace . `` Meanwhile , the melancholy `` Dreams For Plans '' shimmers beneath sparkling production , while `` Hey You '' is a slinky piece of flirtatious fun ensconced in mariachi horns that brings levity to the album . She also sings out for those oppressed by war in the courageous `` Timor '' and provides her best chance at a hit single with `` Illegal , '' a refreshingly understated piece that derives an awesome punch from Carlos Santana 's playing and belittles those who play games with others ' hearts.Despite a few tracks that would have been better left off the record in favor of others , especially `` Something , '' a dissapointing translation of the unbelievable `` En Tus Pupilas '' from `` Vol . 1 , '' one fact can not be denied : Shakira does not rest on her laurels , but instead consistently challenges herself as a writer and prompts her audience to think , feel and care . There is something to be said for that , especially from a woman who not long ago barely knew any English ."}, "25662": {"id": "25661", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Shakira came along during the Latin explosion of the late 90 's except unlike many who populated the genre , she was n't born and raised in the United States nor was English her first language . Her lack of experience in the language showed on her first English speaking album , Laundry Service , she made up in presentation and was much more experimental than the Latin pop of Jennifer Lopez or Ricky Martin whose songs all sounded alike.After taking a couple years off , Shakira came back this year with two albums , back in July she released the Spanish language Fijacion Oral vol . 1 ( translation Oral Fixation ) that featured La Tortura , a song with so much sexual tension even American did n't need a translation , and more recently she released the English language Oral Fixation vol . 2 ( translation Fijacion Oral ) . There are two songs that overlap both albums , the lovely Something and the uplifting The Day and the Time.Volume 2 actually starts of with some people chanting the Lords Prayer . I think this is the first time chanting was included in a pop song since Enigma scored their only hit with Sadness part 1 . But the song , How Do You Do , quickly turns into a rocker about the violence that surrounds religion with lyrics like , `` How many people die , and hurt in your name ? Hey , does that make you proud , or does it bring you shame ? '' Apparently George Bush and Osama bin Laden have the answers.After the opener , Shakira deals with a failed relation on Do n't Bother and Illegal , the later which feature Carlos Santana and his trademark guitar and sound like a more somber version Underneath Your Clothes claiming `` it should be illegal to break a woman 's heart . '' Do n't Bother , on the other hand is a more upbeat kiss-off to a former flame who is trying to reunite.Even though this time around Shakira seems to master the English language a little better , her strong point is still in the presentation . And it seems as if she has been listening to a lot of American 80 's since her last album . During How Do You Do , there is a guitar solo that song very similar to Edie Brickell 's What I Am , while on Do n't Bother , the guitars seemed to be borrowed from the Cure 's Just Like Heaven . The bouncy Hey You sounds like something out of the Stray Cats catalog had a female been the lead singer . And she even seems influenced by bands who themselves like the 80 's retro sound as The Day and the Time sound much like The Killer 's Smile Like You Me It . But she does go old school Latin music with the inclusion of mariachi horns on Animal City . But in each case she is able to make it her own.The album ends much like it starts off but instead it 's a children 's choir that does the chanting on yet another 80 's influenced Timor which relays heavy on synthesizers and drum loops . But instead of religion , politics is the topic with the kids asking throughout the song , `` How about the people who do n't matter anymore ? '' Taking aim at the apathy that plagues the youth around the wealthy world who care more about what 's on MTV than those less fortunate who are dieing whether it be by war or by hunger ."}, "25663": {"id": "25662", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Shakira is a skank . `` Oral Fixation '' she so cleverly calls her most recent output of overtly sexual bile .

Oh , she 's just trying to be sexy , you say . No , she passed sexy years ago and took a left turn towards media prostitution . I do n't care if she has an ounce of singing ability ( and I 'm sure you know about the technology in the recording studio these days ) , that 's clearly not what she 's selling.So why the five stars ?

However , the sound quality of `` Hips Do n't Lie '' for some reason sounds a little muffled like it was recorded cheaply , not cool . Total , the whole cd is fantastic . The only complaint I have is I wish they could have released the cd with ALL of the songs on it , i had to buy it twice , not cool . My feeling is , you have to be in the mood to hear Shakira , she is in a class of her own , she has a unique style of singing and her lyrics are deep and at times , bizarre . I like to play the cd from start to finish , it really puts you in Shakira 's world . I am a new fan , and I hope Shakira 's star continues to shine .

Here 's the breakdown : Disc 1 ( 72:04 minutes ) : Tracks 1 to 7 are his debut US solo album , `` All By Myself '' , issued April 1971 on Tamla TS 309Tracks 8 to 18 are his 2nd US album , `` People ... Hold On '' , issued May 1972 on Tamla T 315LDisc 2 ( 74:14 minutes ) : Tracks 1 to 8 are his 3rd US album , `` Eddie Kendricks '' , issued May 1973 on Tamla T 327LTracks 9 to 16 are his 4th US album , `` For You '' , issued November 1974 on Tamla T6-33551 ( There are no single versions nor any previously unreleased tracks of any kind on this set - they feature on the last disc of the companion volume - `` The Thin Man '' - The Motown Albums Vol.2 '' ( reviewed separately ) PACKAGING : Both CDs are Brown & Yellow with the Tamla World logo - aping the way the US LP labels would have looked , The 28-page booklet pictures both the LP sleeves front and rear in full colour , gives detailed notes on the song-writer and session players involved , lists US singles and their B-sides that came off each album ( details from the actual Motown session logs ) and there 's an essay on Hendricks ' career by noted Motown writer BRIAN CHIN . In between the exact reproduction of album sleeves are high-quality colour pictures of Kendricks from the early Seventies - in fact the booklet like the silver digipak that houses the whole thing - has an overall classy feel about it . But the best bit - as always with HIP-O SELECT - is the wonderful SOUND ... SOUND : All tracks have been remastered by one of Universal 's trio of in-houses wizard tape engineers - SUHA GUR - a name that has turned up on many of the `` Gold '' 2CD sets dedicated to other Motown acts . Typical of HIP-O SELECT , the sound is superlative and like the packaging , reeks of class and pride in what 's been presented to you . Stylistically , Kendricks ' high voice and the string-drenched arrangements of the songs sound like Eugene Record and The Chi-Lites . On other songs , it 's very Philadelphia International . On the downside , there is fairly audible hiss on some of the `` All By Myself '' tracks , but none too much to detract from the soulful listen . Besides , it all but disappears completely by the time we get to the next album , 1972 's fantasic `` People ... Hold On '' . You can now HEAR the drums and bass on `` Girl You Need A Change Of Mind '' like never before - funky , warm and sweet . Disc 2 simply offers up more of the same . A very sweet listen indeed.To sum-up , I can only add to the excellent and informative reviews that went before this - this is a great Motown set.A job well done by HIP-O SELECT - and one that will have you reaching for Volume 2 ..."}, "25668": {"id": "25667", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Now whoever said that Eddie was all ballads and no funk surely has n't heard this wonderful set of 4 of his albums : ALL BY MYSELF , PEOPLE ... HOLD ON , EDDIE KENDRICKS , and FOR YOU . It brings a tear to my eye just to relive the wonderful moments I remember as a child in the 70s when my mum used to play these in the house almost on a constant basis ! ALL BY MYSELF , released in April 1971 ( # 6 R & B ; , # 80 Pop ) was Eddie 's first solo album after leaving the Temptations . LET 'S GO BACK TO DAY ONE is a funky opening with Eddie 's vocal multi-layered ala Marvin Gaye ! THIS USED TO BE THE HOME OF JOHNNIE MAE was the B-side of IT 'S SO HARD FOR ME TO SAY GOODBYE ( # 37 R & B ; , # 88 Pop ) and I DID IT ALL FOR YOU , a popular Quiet Storm tune , was the B-side to CAN I ( # 37 R & B ; , # 101 Pop ) , another popular Quiet Storm staple also performed by Brenda Holloway and most recently covered by Phil Perry . SOMETHING 'S BURNING starts off slow and ends with a funky ending and the Jimmy Webb composition , DID N'T WE close this set ! What 's wonderful is that the Temptations ' notes to Eddie originally printed on the back of the album are reprinted for this release ! PEOPLE ... HOLD ON , with its eye-catching photography by Weldon A. McDougal III , was originally released in May 1972 , which fared better on the charts ( # 13 R & B ; , # 131 Pop ) . According to the liner notes , Frank Wilson said in an interview for Eddie 's ULTIMATE COLLECTION ( 1998 ) that it was a concept album dedicated to black America . It opens with IF YOU LET ME ( # 17 R & B ; , # 66 Pop ) , originally performed by Jimmy Ruffin . LET ME RUN INTO YOUR LONELY HEART is the funky B-side to EDDIE 'S LOVE ( # 35 R & B ; , # 77 Pop ) while on DAY BY DAY , Eddie 's vocals are once again multi-layered . GIRL YOU NEED A CHANGE OF MIND is the biggest hit off here ( # 13 R & B ; , # 87 Pop ) with its innovative use of multi-drums throughout the track and still a favorite among club goers . SOMEDAY WE 'LL HAVE A BETTER WORLD has a gospel feel to it and reminiscent of Stevie Wonder 's HEAVEN HELP US ALL with Eddie singing in his natural register . MY PEOPLE ... HOLD ON is a major highlight here with African drums opening the song and on the break and DATE WITH THE RAIN is another dance favorite among today 's club goers . I 'M ON THE SIDELINE has Eddie 's voice once again multi-layered throughout the song and the album closes with JUST MEMORIES , the B-side to IF YOU LET ME and with it 's operatic opening , remains another highlight to this album.EDDIE KENDRICKS ( # 5 R & B ; , # 18 Pop ) , released in May 1973 , charted higher than the above , especially on the strength of the # 1 R & B ; /Pop hit KEEP ON TRUCKIN ' , most recently resurrected and remixed by DJ Spinna for the MOTOWN : REMIXED compilation ( 2005 ) . ONLY ROOM FOR TWO opens the album and the Caribbean-sounding DARLING COME BACK HOME ( # 26 R & B ; , # 67 Pop ) , was another hit off here . EACH DAY I CRY A LITTLE is IMO Eddie 's finest performance and also a Quiet Storm favorite while CA N'T HELP WHAT I AM is a light tune on being who he is . ANY DAY NOW ( originally performed by Chuck Jackson ) and NOT ON THE OUTSIDE ( originally performed by the Moments ) are underrated remakes of soul classics and Eddie makes it his own on both selections and the album closes with WHERE DO YOU GO ( BABY ) , a beautiful Pam Sawyer/Gloria Jones composition about Eddie wondering where his woman is when he is n't there.This compilation does n't include BOOGIE DOWN which followed EDDIE KENDRICKS , but according to the liner notes , it will be released in another double-disc set ! In the meantime , we get to hear FOR YOU , released November 1974 ( # 8 R & B ; , # 108 Pop ) . It opens with the laid-back PLEASE DO N'T GO AWAY , while ONE TEAR ( # 8 R & B ; , # 71 Pop ) , originally for Marvin Gaye and SHOESHINE BOY ( # 1 R & B ; , # 18 Pop ) became the biggest hits off of this album . DEEP AND QUIET LOVE is an underrated Quiet Storm performance while LET YOURSELF GO is another underrated funk performance . I played this one at one of my parties and the response was amazing ! IF YOU THINK ( YOU CAN ) has great word play throughout the song . IF is a great remake originally performed by Bread and TIME IN A BOTTLE is just as good , originally performed by Jim Croce , which ends the album.Folks , if you are not by now , this wonderfully packaged 2-CD set will make or renew your interest in Eddie Kendricks , IMO the greatest tenor that ever graced a record !"}, "25669": {"id": "25668", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "For years , we fans of the legendary Eddie James Kendricks ( 1939-1992 ) have prayed , written Motown endless letters and even waged an online petition to have this come to pass - to have all of Eddie 's original albums reissued on CD . I 've always felt that Eddie 's career as a soloist was never given its proper due because in the eyes of the industry , his work with the Temptations seemed to supercede everything he did on his own , and that was truly not fair . They wanted to boil his career down to two hits - `` Keep On Truckin ' '' and `` Boogie Down '' - and like nothing else he did was worthwhile . Motown continued to contribute to this mode of thinking as well . Please ! That is as far from the truth as you can get ! But finally , after so very long , some of Eddie 's original albums are now available on CD . In this collection , we have four remastered EJK CDs from the 1970s : ALL BY MYSELF ( 1971 ) PEOPLE ... HOLD ON ( 1972 ) EDDIE KENDRICKS ( 1973 ) FOR YOU ( 1974 ) These four albums are chock full of quality material by Eddie , all produced by the team of Frank Wilson and Leonard Caston ( except Eddie 's debut LP , which was produced by Wilson alone ) . Looking for early popular cuts by EJK like `` Can I '' , `` This Used To Be The Home Of Johnnie Mae '' , `` If You Let Me '' , `` Girl You Need A Change of Mind '' , `` Keep On Truckin ' '' and `` Shoeshine Boy '' ? Well , like the compilation of hits CDs that Motown has issued previously , those songs are all here ... but these are the albums where those choice cuts came from . Chronologically , the album BOOGIE DOWN from late 1973 - early '74 was completed and issued before FOR YOU . But due to the timing of the tracks on that album , BOOGIE DOWN could n't be included here ... but it will be in the next volume of Eddie 's works , which will be released later on in '06 . Be on the lookout for it.I am very happy with this collection , and the remastering is nearly flawless . Only complaint I have is the treatment of the seven-minute plus ballad `` Each Day I Cry A Little '' from the EDDIE KENDRICKS album . Filled with spoken passages and an emotionally devastating message , it 's so heartbreakingly beautiful , it has to be one of the very best in the entire EJK catalog . For those who have never heard this masterpiece , IMO , its closest comparison would probably be the Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes ' magnum opus `` I Miss You '' from 1972 - not so much by the sound , but because both these songs feature spoken passages and anguished vocals revealing men in emotional pain . However , the way it 's mixed here has too much echo , the background singers ' vocals are brought so far to the front at times you do n't hear much of Eddie , and the strings are a bit overpowering , especially halfway through and towards the end of the song . I have the original vinyl LP and the mix is different . But other than that , this is a perfect collection of four of Eddie 's excellent Motown solo albums . For anyone who has only brought Eddie 's greatest hits CDs in the past and craved to have more , this is an absolute MUST for you to own ! ! Want to know why Eddie is one of the greatest R & B ; legends of all time and why he will never be forgotten ?

That should 've been the name of Anthony Hamilton 's latest effort . After having two labels fold before you have a chance at getting your voice heard , Anthony Hamilton was still able to keep his mind right and his game tight . Popping up on the Nappy Roots ' song `` Po Folks '' would be the key to recapturing the faith of a label exec , this time around it being the eyes of Jermaine Dupri . He saw the potential Anthony Hamilton had from just that one song , but the legwork and the sacrifices that he must have had to endure must be astronomical considering he 's been trying since at least the mid-1990s to get noticed . Now after the platinum-selling `` debut '' album Comin From Where I 'm From and the rush release of the shelved Soulife album , Anthony Hamilton satisfies our soul with his latest effort Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' . `` Ca n't Let Go '' is a very strong statement for Mr. Hamilton to go with as the first single from the album . Not only does it refer to a relationship he does n't want to end , but it also parallels as his passion towards being the best singer he can be . `` Southern Stuff '' talks about the qualities he likes in a certain woman , while `` Sista Big Bones '' is a fun song about his admiration for the 'healthy ' girls out there . `` The Truth '' illustrates his devotion to being frank and honest about his love , and `` Change The World '' has a old-school vibe that the grown-up crowd can appreciate . `` I Know What Love 's All About '' is another one for the 'grown and sexy ' to enjoy while the more virtuous individuals will be partial to `` Pass Me Over . '' The title track `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' is the signature sound we experienced from his previous album , while Anthony offers up a little falsetto on `` Never Love Again . `` And even though I 'm not particularly fond of the style and delivery on `` Where Did It All Go , '' `` Everybody , '' and `` Preacher 's Daughter , '' they do n't detract that much from the flow of the rest of the album .

I am amazed at how he was able to follow up his debut with a collection of songs as equally soulful and rousing as the first ! That is to be commended . This album is reminiscent of so many greats . Clearly you can hear the storytelling of a Bill Withers ( Preacher 's Daughter ) the moans of Al Green , the wails of Bobby Womack , the pain of a Donny Hathaway . Do I hear Prince influences as well ? The bass , the horns and organs and guitar licks of the music I grew up listening to as a child.Amazing production and arrangement , not to mention Hamilton 's great songwriting . Seriously listen to the lyrics . The man knows pain . The man knows love . Tracks 10 ( Change Your World ) , 11 ( Never Love Again ) and 12 ( I Know What Love 's All About ) ( which is very reminiscent of D'Angelo 's `` Higher '' cut on the Brown Sugar album ) are the stand-out tracks on this album . Pure , heartfelt , black folk 's down-home soul music ! ! ! I purchased this album a week ago . Listened to the whole thing on my way home , got home and absorb the beautiful soul of this music ! I am in love with this album . And God bless Anthony Hamilton for singing about something other than being trapped in a closet or feeling on someones booty ! ! ! ! This is real grown folk 's music ! ! ! I 'm not too fond of Preacher 's Daughter or Sista Big Bones , preferring his more soulful and slower tempo 's grooves.Thank you for giving your fans back the soul of Withers , Green , Womack , Hathaway , Gaye and so many other greats - with an urban , twist to it ! Much Love ."}, "25681": {"id": "25680", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Every now and then an artist comes out of nowhere to impress you with a music release that is far beyond expectations . Anthony Hamilton 's `` Comin ' From Where I 'm From '' was definitely an example of this . Before hearing the CD , the only time that I had heard Anthony Hamilton was when he was singing hooks for Nappy Roots , Xzibit , etc . The only r & b ; track that I had heard him on was a song that was on Sunshine Anderson 's CD entitled `` Last Night '' . That track also featured Dolo Pichino . When I first heard the title track , `` Comin From Where I 'm From '' , I was impressed because after only hearing Anthony Hamilton on rap hooks , I did n't know that a solo song from him would sound so good . Once the CD was released I was hooked . While most people heard the title track and `` Charlene '' since those were the songs that were released , the best material ended up being other tracks on the CD such as `` Mama Knew Love '' where Jermaine Dupri took the beat that Jay Z used for `` Blueprint ( Momma Loves Me ) '' and Anthony Hamilton definitely took care of the rest with the vocals , `` Since I See n't You '' , which is still my favorite song from the CD , where Anthony crafts the perfect midtempo song with help from Mark Batson and Maya Jones and `` Cornbread , Fish & Collard Greens '' where Anthony takes a nice feel good uptempo track and blends everything with the rest of the CD.Earlier this year , Rhino released a CD of earlier material from Anthony Hamilton entitled `` Soullife '' . However , this CD is n't actually Anthony Hamilton 's second CD . Do n't let this fool you though , because there is some nice material on this CD . My favorite track by far is `` I Used To Love Someone '' .Anthony Hamilton 's second CD is entitled `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' . Although , this CD was just released on December 13th , I can tell you already that this disc is a certified classic . `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' is a CD that will be in rotation for years to come . It 's released in December 2005 , but the material definitely has an old school r & b ; feel to it . The 1st single , `` Ca n't Let Go '' is a clear indication of what you should expect on the CD . What I do n't understand though is that for some reason there are some people that are n't really feelin ' this track . Ladies and gentlemen , I do n't know if you can get any better than this when it comes to r & b ; music with an old school soul sound to it . `` Ca n't Let Go '' is classic Anthony Hamilton as he understands that in a relationship there are going to be ups and downs , but the ultimate reality is that since I care about you so much , that no matter what happens we are going to be together and I `` Ca n't Let Go '' . The CD starts off differently though as Anthony tries to backtrack and wonder `` Where Did It Go Wrong ? '' Throughout the track he tries to go through all the details to figure out where things started to go bad in his past . What he is trying to understand is why he still wants to be with someone that has put him through things and if he can still depend on this person in the future . `` Southern Stuff '' ends up being a nice feel good jam just like `` Cornbread , Fish & Collard Greens '' was on `` Comin ' From Where I 'm From '' . However , the southern `` stuff '' that Anthony is referring to can be translated to mean many things . The title track is a nice track because Anthony takes a break from the old school r & b ; to remind people that through everything that there are still basic everyday problems that are still going on in the world that we ca n't afford to continue to ignore . In essence , he is saying that the majority of the world is just worrying about what 's going on in their lives intead of having a broader scope about what 's going on in the world and in surroundings other than their own . Raphael Saadiq produces a nice track for Anthony Hamilton to talk about what 's going on in the world today . Vidal & Dre produce a nice midtempo jam in `` The Truth '' where Anthony tells the woman that he is involved to just trust in him and what they are trying to build instead of concentrating on past events . `` Preacher 's Daughter '' sounds like a 70s track that may have been on the Superfly soundtrack as Anthony is quick to remind us that you ca n't judge a book by its cover . Just because someone may appear to be something , in the end they can be just as bad as anyone else . In this case , it just happens to be the preacher 's daughter . `` Pass Me Over '' definitely has a gospel feel to it . I hate to compare anything that Anthony Hamilton does to Mariah Carey but just as Mariah did with `` Fly Like A Bird '' , Anthony Hamilton shows that he can be versatile with his music and have a gospel feel to his music as well . This may be a prelude to an Anthony Hamilton gospel CD , who knows . After hearing alot of old school soul , `` Everybody '' may throw alot of people off . All of a sudden , Anthony breaks into a reggae groove after what is basically a gospel song . I admire Anthony 's versatility so I do n't have a problem with this track but some people will . After producing `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin '' 's first three tracks , Mark Batson shows up again with `` Sista Big Bones '' . Now this track is pretty good and I can feel the subject material because he is basically saying that he can deal with `` thick '' women just like he can deal with any other type of woman , but compared to the rest of the tracks on this CD , `` Sista Big Bones '' just does n't live up to the rest of the classics on this CD , in my opinion.However , in one track that changes drastically as James Poyser and Questlove from The Roots help Anthony Hamilton create another masterpiece in `` Change Your World '' . When r & b ; music was created to make love songs , this song would definitely classify to be a blueprint for that . If you like slow jams that talk about love this song will turn out to be one of your favorites in the year 2006 and for years to come . This song is my favorite track from the CD so far . Kevin Wooten , who produced `` Pass Me Over '' helps Anthony create another great slow jam in `` Never Love Again '' . Unlike `` Where Did It Go Wrong '' , where Anthony still wants to make a gallant effort to make things work , this track analyzes all the bad things that happened in this particular relationship and why he would never want to fall in love again . Any man will be able to relate to this track . Kevin Wooten shows up again to end things with `` I Know What Love 's All About '' . As one reviewer said , this track really has an Al Green feel to it . Anthony talks about the trials and tribulations in a relationsip which means in essence , he knows what love is really about.If anyone thought that Anthony Hamilton would suffer from the sophomore jinx , they will be sadly mistakened . This CD will end up being a classic in the long run . If anyone has any doubts about Anthony Hamilton 's 2nd disc , I 'm hear to erase those doubts right now . If you enjoyed `` Comin ' From Where I 'm From '' and `` Soullife '' , you will DEFINITELY enjoy `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' . You can not afford to pass up on this CD.Trust me on that one.James ' Top 51 ) Change Your World2 ) Never Love Again3 ) Ca n't Let Go4 ) Southern Stuff5 ) Ai n't Nobody Worryin '"}, "25682": {"id": "25681", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This album is a golden disc that simueltaneously soothes the soul , impresses the mind with gift , and gives it nutrition with the social and spirtual lyrical tones.Musically -- - he seamlessly carries his signature soul fashion straight into genres like gospel and reggae for moments that are thoroughly heartfelt , enjoyed , and seamless.A beautifully produced and played album .

It is hard to make an album that is just as good as your first release , yet Hamilton does it here with flying colors presenting a soulful journey that no true R & B ; fan can miss . In fact , Hamilton has made easily one of 2005 's best and most credible R & B ; albums without having to conform to the contemporary R & B ; standards of today . With this soulful masterpiece , Hamilton evokes what everyone loves about soul including the soulful drum grooves and the raw emotion of the lyrics . Through Anthony Hamilton , you can hear the influences of greats like Bill Withers and Teddy Pendergrass , just to mention a few.Production is among the best that I 've heard in any R & B ; album in 2005 . Throughout the album , Hamilton keeps the soulful formula with wailing earthy organs , soulful sharp guitars , warm electric keyboards , Al Green reminiscent horns and horn synths , and acoustic piano . While it would not be fair to call Hamilton a hip-hop artist , the drum programming that hinges the arrangement is both soulful enough for the older fans and hip-hop enough for young followers of Hamilton who embrace the sanctity of Hamilton 's music . Furthermore , besides the brilliant production work , there is no filler material whatsoever on this album ; everything is just as good as everything else ( relatively speaking of course ) just as Hamilton 's Grammy nominated COMIN ' FROM WHERE I 'M FROM was . With that said , my favorites from this spectacular album are : `` Where Did It Go Wrong '' , `` Southern Stuff '' , `` Ca n't Let Go '' ( which is a 5/5 for me ) , `` Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' '' , `` Change Your World '' , `` Never Love Again '' , and `` I Know What Love 's About '' .

But my fears were groundless and Hamilton has given us another solid set of southern soul songs . This is the real deal right here , straightforward with no gimmicks . As Dizzy Gillespie once famously said ( at least I think it was him ) : `` This is how music should sound ! `` He may never be a darling of the MTV/TRL crowd ( which is probably why I have n't yet seen any promo video for any song off this CD ) but I think he knows he does n't need them . Despite what greedy suits and pessimistic bean counters might think , I truly believe there will always be a solid fan base for this kind of music . This guy is turning out instant classics and where some male vocalists will be forgotten in five to ten years time , I see people picking up Hamilton 's stuff in 20 years time plus , in much the same way people are still picking up stuff from the seventies by people like Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway today.It took a few listens of this CD for any particular tracks to grab me ( not necessarily a bad thing ) but songs like `` Preacher 's Daughter '' , `` Sista Big Bones '' and `` Change Your World '' have now grown on me and warm my heart now every time I hear them.If only more brothers would do it the way Anthony Hamilton does it .

This had led to a shrinking amount of artist who sings over smooth soul grooves like All Green and Donnie Hathaway did in the heyday of the genre . Yeah today we have Alicia Keys and John Legend , but that 's about it . Another guy that can be added to that list is Anthony Hamilton who , even though he may be best known for singing hooks for rappers like Nappy Roots and Jadakiss , has recently arrived to help keep soul music alive.Hamilton 's latest album , Ai n't Nobody Worryin ' focuses on all the tried and true soul theme of love whether it lost love ( Where Did It Go Wrong ? ) , trying to hold on love ( Ca n't Let Go ) , and right in the middle of love ( Truth ) as well as the general I Know What Love 's All About . And singing the hook on Jadakiss ' Why stirred some political awareness too in the vein of Marvin Gaye with songs like the title track ( How the children gon na learn when they got ta take turns cause they ai n't got books to read ) and Preacher 's Daughter ( She had a habit that she could n't really stop , needed money so she had to hit the block ) which also features Tarsha McMillian who added some gravity to the already deep song.Pass Me Over is the best song here as it 's the total package . The song is a gospel like ode about waiting for your Savior and is highlighted by a space piano and crescendos at the end with a choir backing Hamilton up , in his best vocal performance on the album , then comes down and concludes in a beautiful instrumental as Hamilton tells us he will `` meet you on the other side .

Take the irresistible single `` I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor '' , for example . On the album , lead singer Alex Turner says : `` Stop making the eyes at me/I 'm still making the eyes at you '' but on the show , he said `` Stop breaking the ties with me/I 'm still breaking the ties with you '' . It 's also interesting that before the final musical breakdown on `` A Certain Romance '' , Alex pointed out to the audience and said , `` That man just yawned . `` But neither of those things take away from the overall greatness of those respective songs , or of the album as a whole .

British new music mag NME voted the Arctic Monkeys one of the 50 best British bands OF ALL TIME ! !

Really . It does pain me to admit it , but this is one of the best new records I 've heard in ages . Would n't go so far as top 50 British bands ever , but sh-t man , I ca n't stop listening to this . Seriously , every day.So what 's it sound like ? Well , it definitely fits comfortably right there amidst the Killers , Franz Ferdinand , Maximo Park , Kaiser Chiefs , and almost just like Hot Hot Heat for that brief moment when they were really really good . Not so much channelling 'new wave ' but more sort of reimagining the sound of the Fall , but where Pavement turned the Fall into ironic indie slouch rock jangle , the Arctic Monkeys twist it into some impossibly hooky dancey drunken night out at the pub.Angular guitars , sort of scrape-y and edgy and scrappy and jagged , super kinetic almost funky rhythms , killer melodies , bouncy tempos , lots of shuffle and start stop jangle and roar . And killer keening vocals , a little bit whine-y , but scruffy and capable of wailing when necessary . And the most amazingly thick Scottish brogue , ya know when the word `` scumbag '' sounds like `` skoooombeg '' .And let 's not forget the songs . By now most of you have heard the excellently titled `` I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor '' , a perfect blast of bubbly snotty bouncy dance punk . But then there 's tracks like `` When The Sun Goes Down '' with its moody sad boy intro all sweet sad vocals and minor key clean guitars that explode into a pounding kick a -- chaotic rocker , with a killer riff and a totally impossible to resist groove . And the thing is , every song on here is just as good . So while the band will probably end up disappearing , breaking up or calling it quits after this record , I mean , how impossible is it to live up to all the critical accolades ( imagine being held up alongside bands like the Clash and the Jam , all before the age of 20 ) but for now , you might as well believe the hype ."}, "25705": {"id": "25704", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "In high school `` Stroke You Up '' was the jam , so I went downtown and bought the cassette .

California Girls , Help Me Rhonda , I Get Around , and other early hits will always remain classics and keep any party hopping . I have three of them and they all work fine .

I listened to this album when I first bought it in '97 , and I did n't really think it was all that ... a shocker because KRS usually comes correct . But then I listened to it again and ... well , I did n't realize just how bad it was.When artists release classic albums at the beginning of their career and then some of their following albums do n't even come close ( and they usually do n't ) , people say that 's an unfair comparison because they ca n't be expected to live in the past , or , `` How can you compare this to THAT ? '' ( Check comparing any Nas album , or ANY album , to Illmatic . ) But after hearing this album , you 'll REALLY wish Kris stuck to his old style . There are many interludes where Kris is preaching , and they just do n't seem to fit . And the only real saving graces on this album are `` Heartbeat '' ( with Angie Martinez and Redman , who once again steals the show ) , `` The MC '' , and `` Step Into A World '' , even though the latter 's music is slightly irritating.The rest of the album is a downer . The production AND rapping are surprisingly bad . And I 'm not saying the rapping is bad because he stopped swearing , because his last album was all right ( remember `` MC 's Act Like They Do n't Know '' ? ) ; here , it 's hard to tell if he even tried . `` Blowe '' has a very unnecessary and incomprehensible skit at the beginning , and the music sounds like the batteries in somebody 's walkman suddenly went dead . KRS 's rapping is tired here , and even Redman comes off wack . It 's hard to tell if the title track is a rap or a low-budget movie , and you 'd be slapped silly if you were caught singing along to `` H.I.P.H.O.P . '' or `` The Real Hip-Hop Part II '' ( what great titles , huh ? ) .When Kris does come through on the lyrics , the tracks are ruined by the sleepy production , especially in `` A Friend '' ( when it was released , everyone pretended to like it ) and `` Over Ya Head '' ( the trumpet does n't fit and you almost expect KRS to start singing ) . But the two last tracks are the worst . `` Just To Prove A Point '' is mixing rap and rock . That 's commonplace NOW , but back then it did n't sound right , and it especially does n't sound right for HIM to be screaming like a rock star . He 's not even on any kind of beat . The final track is a remix of `` Step Into A World '' featuring Puff Daddy . Puff is being his typical wack self , but it also rubs off on KRS . And what 's KRS-One doing with Puff Daddy anyway ? Overall , this album is worse than I remembered it . I still kept in mind what year this album was made before I wrote this review , but like I said before , I did n't like it back then either . I hoped KRS would redeem himself with subsequent albums , but according to reviews , those albums are n't great either , and record sales show that they 're just collecting dust anyway .

But compared to the albums immediately before and after it , it 's nothing to write home about . Their first album BLUE LINES was a milestone in the world of trip hop , and it seems like the group was n't sure how to follow it up . Unfortunately , they did the worst possible thing : they basically made the same album again , but not as well . If I ever make an album as great as BLUE LINES , I 'll be tempted to copy myself too , but hopefully I 'll do a better job than they did.Protection opens with a slow dramatic opener just like its predecessor , but `` Protection '' lacks the spare menace and singular production of `` Safe From Harm '' , and Tracey Thorn is a much more conventional vocalist than the last album 's Shara Nelson . The tiny `` Payback '' sample in the middle of the song 's main riff is cute , but otherwise this song eases into background music mode too much to be effective , and the rest of the album follows in this vein . `` Karmacoma '' is one of the better tunes of the bunch , with great vocals by the soon-to-quit Tricky and a jumped-up dub beat . It 's a poor cousin to BLUE LINES ' `` Five Man Army '' , but still not bad . The thing that really sinks this album is the instrumentals . `` Weather Storm '' and `` Heat Miser '' are completely inconsequential tracks that meander aimlessly and suck up eight minutes of the listener 's attention for no good reason . The production on this album is overall much warmer and less abrasive than their previous work , so these instrumental bits really turn into Muzak . There 's another minor triumph mid-album with `` Better Things '' , one of the few instances on the record where both the vocals and the music are equally gripping . The live cover of `` Light My Fire '' at the end is just the final nail in the coffin ; it 's abrasive , but in the wrong way . It sounds like it was made by a completely different , and much crappier , reggae rock band . I 'm getting pissed off just listening to it as I compose this review.Shortly after the release of this album , Massive Attack contracted the Mad Professor to remix it , and his version of the record , NO PROTECTION , is leagues better . After that , the band underwent a massive ( ha ! ) reinvention , and played up their more monolithic side for the enormous-sounding MEZZANINE .

Of course , research into the style inevitably led me to Don Caballero , and I picked up `` World Class Listening Problem , '' which I really liked . I decided to get some of their back catalog , and started with Don Caballero II . What I got was the auditory equivalent of having my eyes propped open to watch a documentary about humanity 's most amazing scientific discoveries , but randomly spliced with scenes of brutal torture . Yes , it rocked . Yes , it was brilliantly executed . Yes , Don Che has eight arms . There was no question as to whether or not I respected what it represented , but no matter how much I listened to it , I could not bring myself to genuinely like it.What I hear with `` Don Caballero II '' is an underdeveloped compositional approach . Structure is played fast and loose . There are lots of starts and stops , but very few beginnings and endings . Without a clear idea of when things finish , it is difficult to tell when new things begin . The result is often jarring . I get the feeling that the band is trying to capture a sense of improvisation , within which some meandering is permissible . Without a clear sense of when the journey begins , though , it is difficult to look forward to arriving at a destination . Instead , I get the general sensation of wandering from one 5/8 riff to the next , hoping to find a shortcut through the chainsaw/cymbal waterboarding scene in `` Please Tokio , Please This Is Tokio . `` Now , this may seem like I have a grudge against noise rock . I do n't . I like chaos a much as anyone . I own and enjoy listening to King Crimson 's THRaKaTTaCK , which can be quite an assault . But chaos , no matter how precisely it is executed , does n't build and release tension by itself.Notice , though , that I did n't say that I hated `` Don Caballero II . '' I said that I found it frustrating , this being because the album is absolutely brilliant at times . It is most successful when the material is allowed to evolve and morph through the rhythmic and melodic variations that are suggested by the riffs themselves . The resulting auditory roller-coaster is a compelling and surprising ride of the highest order , often seamlessly finishing in an entirely different place than where it starts . Unfortunately , we rarely get to see the end of the journey before the record skips.THE LOWDOWN : I understand that part of the math-rock aesthetic is a detachment from the audience , and perhaps it is too late for me to really appreciate that mindset . I will never be able to experience Don Caballero II in the context of 1995 . Maybe I missed out . Perhaps math rock itself evolved , and I am only a fan of its later iterations . Regardless , as much as I want to like `` Don Caballero II , '' I am OK with just letting myself be frustrated by it and moving on .

In October 1993 , it was the first instance Motown released a good number of classic 60s Supremes sides back in their original mono , many that did n't make it to the `` Hitsville U.S.A. '' set , and on that score , it delivers . But this set falls far short of giving fans of the solo Diana ( which I remain ) the heartening and nostalgia-inducing reacquaintance of her recording career we 'd been waiting for . ( It was also a side-by-side failure if you 'd also bought her alleged ` biography , ' `` Secrets of a Sparrow . `` ) One has only to compare the masterpiece work done on the boxed-sets of Aretha Franklin ( `` Queen of Soul '' ) , the Temptations ( `` Emperors of Soul '' ) and James Brown ( `` Star Time '' ) with `` Forever Diana '' to know that the lady was done wrong here . Motown , it 's been 10 years - scrap this one , forget about it ( and we 'll try to too ) , and start over again ."}, "25823": {"id": "25822", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Berry Gordy and Diana Ross really Screwed up here on this 4-disc compilation . My first thought after finally getting thru the four discs was : WHAT were they thinking ? ? ? ? First , let 's start with the APPALLINGLY BAAAADDDD fourth and last Disc . The music they came up with is n't even worth a fourth-rate R & B ; singer . It 's hard to believe Diana Ross had to record such drivel . Apart from the gem `` Best Years of My Life '' , which really was a classic -- well arranged , written and performed . Aside from that one song , the entire fourth disc is a MESS ! ! And this is on a Diana Ross career retrospective collection ? ? ? Com'on Berry Gordy , surely you can do better than this ! ! While Diana 's star was on the decline as the 1990 's began , still considering her stature in the music biz , they could 've come up with better songs and choices for this career retrospective collection . Many reviewers have complained the Supremes stuff on Disc 1 does n't even belong on this retrospective and I 'd have agree . Call it `` Padding '' by Berry Gordy and possibly Diana herself for this collection . With the wealth of Motown material in the vaults from Diana the solo artist since 1970 after she left the Supremes , surely there was plenty of more material and unreleased rarities to add to this collection.They could 've taken notes from Barbra Streisand 's superb 4-disc 1991 retrospective `` Just For the Record '' , released two years earlier . On `` For the Record '' , Streisand was wise to include outtakes , alternative versions and unreleased tracks from the music vaults . THAT 'S how you do a career retrospective ! ! ! Instead here , Diana 's fans have to put up with lousy songs and the waste of an entire disc space on Disc 4 . On some selections , you can even detect Diana 's own indifference towards the lackluster material.Berry Gordy also skimped on the sound quality . It 's mediocre at best . Again , it just shows lack of attention to detail and the basics . In 1993 when this retrospective was released , improvements were already being made on sound remastering technology as record companies were re-releasing classic CD 's with improved digital sound . Since `` Forever Diana 's '' release in 1993 , there have been Diana Ross and the Supremes compilations with much better sound , especially those released in the last 10 years since the early 2000 's . If Berry Gordy and Diana had decided to spend as much time on the sound quality as they did on the vanity project that went into the accompanying booklet , then maybe results would be much , much better in the sound department.If they ever decide to go back and release another Diana Ross career retrospective ( which does n't appear likely ) , they would have to re-think and re-do the entire song selection process ( especially filter out the Supremes stuff ) and go with the best digital Remastering for sound . They would also have to release classic tracks in their original entirety , not skimp to the single remix versions ( with `` Love Hangover '' `` Ai n't No Mountain High Enough '' as painful examples here ) . Her fans deserve much better treatment for sticking with this Diva for the past half century.Then again , the fans must be wondering , `` Why bother ? '' There are better Diana Ross two-disc collections out there with better sound , better selection of songs , so why bother with this lousy 4-disc compilation ? Too bad Diana Ross decided to call this career retrospective `` Forever Diana '' b/c the compilation does not stand the test of time nor deserve to be called `` Forever Diana '' . If she and Berry Gordy had decided to spend as much energy and time on the four discs as they did on the accompanying booklet ( a vanity project at best with self-serving photos of the Diva preening and posing in various guises ) , then maybe results would have been much different and better.Instead Berry Gordy decided to give Diana the reins to come up with a Vanity Project by sticking one too many needless , unnecessary tracks as fillers , especially on the last disc when they could 've come up with indeed material that was worth calling `` Forever Diana '' .

Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine , Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness . Shawn 's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album , however there 's is a lot of weak material on the album .

Named after the studio where this was dashed off in the middle of a tour ( a little over a week of studio time ) , it 's obvious the stress was getting to Elton and Bernie . There simply are n't a whole lot of memorable songs here.The one most will know is ballad `` Do n't Let the Sun Go Down on me '' , one of the most enduring tunes in Elton 's canon . `` The Bitch is Back '' , while relatively slight , was a big hit for Elton as well . `` Ticking '' portrays an armed standoff that could have come from today 's newspaper clippings . After that , the good stuff is slim pickings . `` Pinky '' is pleasant enough , but alongside Elton 's other love songs clearly a lesser effort . `` Dixie Lily '' is an homage to a Mississippi riverboat . `` You 're so Static '' is `` Sweet Painted Lady '' part two.. '' I 've seen the Saucers '' is a nice look at life through the eyes of the folks who claim to have met with aliens . `` Grimsby '' is a heavily fictionalized look at an English seaside town.The nadir of the album and possibly Elton 's catalogue is `` Solar Prestige a Gammon '' . Yes , I understand that he wrote it to mock critics for `` reading too much '' into his lyrics . But when John Lennon did the same thing , he came up with `` I Am the Walrus '' and at least the wordplay was clever . `` Stinker '' is also pretty aptly named.As far as the bonus tracks go , you get a decent Christmas tune ( `` Step into Christmas '' ) that still gets holiday airplay Stateside , `` Pinball Wizard '' is the song from `` Tommy '' first done by the Who and probably should 've replaced `` Solar Prestige '' on the album . A good cover is better than a misbegotten original . `` Sick City '' is a jibe at New York City . Again , it 's better than a lot of the material on the album . `` Cold Highway '' was a B side to `` Bitch '' that also should 've made the cut instead of some of what did.In summary : Only completists will need to own this , but if you 're a pretty big Elton John fan it 's worth getting for `` Ticking '' and the bonus material .

'Solar Prestige a Gammon ' is better than you 've been told , it 's slightly jazzy , and Ray plays the Marimba 's beautifully . However , it 's hardly memorable . There 's a pair of ballads , the sickly sweet country-flavoured 'Pinky ' and the more psychedelic / sci-fi 'I 've seen the saucers ' , that sound so great as they start ( both have a nice bongo-drum flavoured beat ) , but they soon fail , despite the good arrangements and nice melodies . Even the jazzy rocker 'You 're so static ' , feels sloppy , though it is enjoyable.If there is a song I dig on this thing it 's 'Stinker ' , a funked up blues-rocker that has real rock 'n ' roll soul , mixed with English eccentricity and an hilarious lyric , as well as perfectly appropriate vocals from Elton . 'Do n't let the sun go down on me ' is a gorgeous and melodic ballad , not quite as heartfelt as it pretends , Elton sounds quite happy as he 's singing this song , but it 's still a very memorable song . It has a very rousing chorus and plenty of spine-tingling melodies . The choice of trumpets was a wonderful addition to the arrangement . 'Ticking ' also has great melodeis , a haunting ballad about a mass-shooting , but the song focuses more on the psychology of the young man with the gun .

You really have to LOVE the harpsichord to like `` Val Hala '' . Beyond that , the album reads as an instruction manual on how to play the recorder . `` Skyline Pigeon '' is the great song of this album , and even so , this version if far inferior to the versions on `` Rare Masters '' or `` Here or There '' .

Then , the `` Reprise '' is nothing more than a fragment of each song on the album meshed into a minute ... blah !

An otherwise superb production effort by Gus Dudgeon is ruined by Elton/Bernie 's buffoonery as they relate songs about a bar fight in a Mexican cantina , a fight between an overworked married couple and the simply incoherent `` Billy Bones '' which takes us from the decks of a stormweathered ship to the flash and pazazz of some rock star 's entrance on stage ... '' Street Kids '' is the only discernible song with any punch here . `` I Feel Like a Bullet '' is the hit Elton tried to push on fans following `` Island Girl '' though it never took off , and its obvious why . While Davey Johnstone 's guitar work is beautiful , and Elton 's falsetto impressive , the song is just too sappy.The remastered version has a beautiful song called `` Sugar on the Floor '' .

The main problem is the over production by Chris Thomas who gives these songs a dense , wall of sound production that drains the melodies dry . The songs themselves however are not that bad . In fact , it 's a shame that several did n't escape to surface on a future album . Opening with Long Way From Hapiness , it 's a fitting opener in lieu of Elton 's recent personal tragedies , the death of Princess Diana and his good friend , Gianni Versace - though the album was recorded prior to those events in the summer of 1997.Taupin returns for another round of lyrics that are his least ambitious in recent memory . Partly based on a loose concept of writing big old time ballads that the likes of Sinatra would sing , the album never quites hits it mark . Most are too simplistic and lack his unique narrative to tell what amounts to basic love stories . Love 's Got A Lot To Answer For is perhaps the best example of this : `` love 's got a lot to answer for , I just ca n't sleep with this feeling anymore '' .Others like , Something About The Way You Look Tonight , which appears to be a grand attempt at a classic ballad , only succeeds due to Elton 's powerful delivery . The melody and lyric however are routine at best.And that 's the problem with the rest . Live Like Horses is a powerful ballad about the death of Taupin 's father but is mired by an over use of synthesizers and unnecessary effects ( if you ever heard this solo , it 's a great song ) . Meanwhile , The End Will Come and I Ca n't Steer My Heart Clear of You simply do n't go anywhere . Most of these songs are slow to mid-tempo with the only real upbeat song being the closer Wicked Dreams . That one , while probably the most interesting lyric , simply never excels into what could have been a great rock song . It 's just simmers , never boils.But all is not lost here . If The River Can Bend is a wonderful gospel rave-up with a fantastic piano solo . January has a melody that changes and shifts dramatically along side one of Taupin 's most romantic lyrics . The title track also has some nice moments , including a wonderful opening of just Elton and piano.As you can see , I struggle with Elton 's albums where I 'm torn . I just ca n't outright not like it because there are some great songs here and Elton sings with great passion throughout.My biggest complaint is the production . It would make a great bookend to The One , another over produced album . But this was five years since The One and Chris Thomas brought nothing new to the table for Elton and these songs . Elton and Thomas had disagreements during the recording according to a recent biography by David Buckley and Taupin complained that the album sounded cold and too technical.The Big Picture falls squarely in the middle of pack of Elton 's albums .

Yes there are some `` good '' songs : Long Way From Happiness , Love Like Horses , Something In The Way You Look Tonight , and The Big Picture . These songs are indeed well crafted . However , they fall a bit short of the best of Elton 's Classic 70 's period as well as from other top releases like The One and Made In England.The remaining tracks are n't terrible per say . However , they just drag on and on without having anything meaningful to say . Coupled with the fact that most of them are over five minutes long , its a real chore to listen to this CD in one sitting.Furthermore , the pacing and stylings of the record are limited . Way too many ballads and mid tempo pieces that lack excitement and verve . On top of that , the arrangements are so identical . Must every piece have a synthesizer string arrangement ? Elton 's trademark keyboard runs just are n't present enough in the overall mix . Yes there are some good solos , but once the solo is finished Elton 's piano playing more often than not falls into the background behind the strings . The guitar , bass , and drums do n't do anything exciting on any of the tracks.A few good songs here and there , but I would recommend passing on this collection ."}, "25895": {"id": "25894", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Maybe , as another reviewer noted , Elton was going through a difficult time when recording this album . Or maybe he 'd been devoting the majority of his time working on songs for Aida and El Dorado ( both projects , according to EJ , were five years in the making ) . Whatever the case , this John/Taupin effort is awfully lukewarm . I was n't particularly fond of Made in England ( sappy self-help songs ) , but at least that record sounded like EJ put effort into it . The Big Picture however has the feel of product -- the perfunctory Elton/Bernie release to keep their giant wheel turning . It 's also not a good sign when the only bonafide hit off this thing , Something About The Way You Look Tonight , is a weak single . Like Healing Hands or You Got ta Love Someone , Something is soft-rock , adult-comtemporary complacency . The song does have wonderful , soulful verses , but the chorus is dull and cliched . The two best songs on this CD are Long Way From Happiness and Recover Your Soul , but neither are classic EJ cuts . Long Way is especially burdened ( as is the whole album ) with drum machines and grandiose electric keyboards . Gosh , how wonderful this song would have been if Elton had recorded it entirely with his piano.In fairness , though , the production is top-notch and Elton 's singing does sound strong . Now middle-aged , it seems Elton 's songwriting skills have dropped but his sense of how to use his voice have improved . Nevertheless , I 'd recommend passing this album by ( or , at worst , purchasing it VERY cheap online ) .

With that said , I can not recommend Seventh Sojourn ( 1972 ) . Every song is either plodding and dull or sticky sweet . The worst offenders are John Lodge 's two offerings on Sojourn . `` Is n't Life Strange ? '' is like gooey treacle . Compare it to the unsentimental beauty of John 's `` Eyes of a Child '' on `` Children 's Children '' . `` I 'm Just a Singer in a Rock 'n Roll Band '' , with its forced energy and `` is it over yet ? '' conclusion gives rock 'n roll a bad name . Compare it to the natural-sounding energy of John 's `` Ride My See Saw '' , on `` Lost Chord '' or `` To Share Our Love '' on `` Threshold '' . Even ace songwriter Justin Hayward flops here , with little cream-puff ditties and inane lyrics : `` All we are trying to say is we are all we 've got '' . Compare them to the passion of his `` Gypsy '' on `` Children '' , The Actor on `` Lost Chord '' , or the perfect rock 'n roll gem `` It 's Up to You '' , on `` Question of Balance '' . Mike Pinder seems to be the only one of the bunch who 's really putting effort into his songs , but the results are ponderous and do not wear well . Do I blame the Moodies for running out of ideas or cashing in on this album 's enormous sales ? Of course not . Obviously they pleased many people and they deserved the recognition .

Belinda even said it , along with the others , that they were pretty much self-tought , and some of their playing/singing was off . She also stressed that because it was the 'punk days ' they could get away with not knowing how to play , because 'it was punk ' . Well , let me just add to that , she tells no lies . It 's necessarily the songs or lyrics . I think the songs could 've been better if Belinda was more vocally trained , and the band was more in shape .

Dr. Dre had managed to disentangle himself from the talons of Suge Knight and Death Row Records . Dre had started his own label , Aftermath , and was ready to sit back , renounce his gangsta image and watch the money roll in . While Death Row was reeling from the death of 2Pac and the disappointing sales of Snoop 's Doggfather album , Dre was poised to start a new rap empire.So out he came with this Aftermath sampler compilation , and we did n't hear from him again for three years . The reason ? The album more or less ... and Dre 's midas production touch was missing on most of the four or five songs he actually had a hand in.It 's a shame , too , because the one Dre track on the album , `` Been There , Done That , '' is really good . The production is smooth and silky , with distinctive percussion and a lazy bass line , and Dre sounds more confident and comfortable than ever as he brags about his earthly possessions . ( `` I 've got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea / It 's worth eight , but I only paid 5.3 . '' ) An entire post-gangsta Dre album in this vein would have sold through the roof , but alas , he had n't the creative energy for it.The other album highlights can be summed up in a couple paragraphs . KRS-One , Nas and B-Real of Cypress Hill perform under the name Group Therapy with `` East Coast / West Coast Killas , '' a Dre-produced track that picks up where `` Natural Born Killas '' left off . The vocal trade-offs are seamless , the bass is solid and the whistling Dre synth is bad @ ss as ever.Mel-Man , who co-produced Dr. Dre 2001 , gets his solo track in `` Sh**tin ' on the World , '' which overcomes its rather non-descript Dre beat with humor , intentional and otherwise . ( Mel 's liner notes read , `` I grew up with roaches y'am saying straight reppin ' the projects to the fullest ! `` ) The aborted R+B girl group Hands-On turns in the piano-heavy , sultry groove `` Got Me Open '' with a Dre rap reminiscent of the same era 's `` No Diggity . '' And RC ( the only artist on the album with two songs ) turns in a decent , funky remake of David Bowie 's `` Fame . `` Otherwise , the album is indistinct , passed down to Dre production apprentices like Bud'da , Floyd Howard , Flossy P and Maurice Wilcher . There 's a reason acts like Miscellaneous , King T , Nowl and Sharief never took off . As an intro record-label sampler , you have to wonder if Dre planned to produce or oversee albums from all these acts or if he was just looking to put together a half- @ ssed compilation and laugh all the way to the bank while Death Row went under .

After trying a Griffin and Logitech device , I finally found a useful workaround with the Behringer UFO202 interface ( there are 2 other very similar models by Behringer -- the UCA202 and the UCA222 ) . What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached , `` dedicated '' USB cord . Simply by plugging the USB cord into the USB port on my iMac I was able to record all of the broadcasts , tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac ( though monitoring required more cords in back -- ugh ! ) .For a committed neophyte like me , the UFO202 was probably sufficient . I miss the permanently attached USB `` out '' cable and , moreover , am questioning whether I 'll ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302USB , which to my eyes has a bit of a `` learning curve . '' The problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual . Instead of separate sections , the manual uses small , thin font and mixes English with Spanish instructions -- a minor but unnecessary inconvenience . ( But give Behringer credit for providing a manual ! ) I thought I was investing in more versatility ( for a modest price increase ) than what the Behringer UFO/UCA line of interfaces offered me . But a friend tells me that GarageBand has the capability of recording sound-on-sound . My present programs ( Sound Studio and Toast ) ca n't do it , but if GB can layer 2 or more sound sources , then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better . If not , the Behringer UFO202 is not only adequate to serve my needs , but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new iMac 's desk space ( Apple 's elimination of the internal burner gives the company `` thin screen '' bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space -- thanks to the new requirement of an external burner ) .Behringer has presented the best solution I 've been able to find to Apple 's surprising ( and dubious ) omissions with the latest iMac .

You can not adjust the delay effect , only turn it on or off .

'' Rule two is , `` Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound . '' I 've used Shure SM58 's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968 . I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used ( and still do use ) them for singing some back up vocals.The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use . Some people , me included , actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic , the Shure SM-57 . The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice . For example , anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58 . People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.The SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect ( which means the bass increases the closer you get . ) This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away . The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they do n't sound right . On the other hand , the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user 's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away . While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic , there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly . It works ok for conga drums and the like , but the SM-58 is about the last thing you 'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar . Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice , but for some people they sound great . The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen . However for other people the SM-58 works better . It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do . If you have a very deep voice , the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.One certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability . This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal . Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available ( at a slight extra cost ) with a built-in on/off switch . The SM-58 's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars . I 've seen SM-58 's dented , rusty , dusty , smoked up , spit into , with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I 've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.All the pro-line Shure mics are top quality . The pro line Shures also hold their value well . If you buy one and decide you do n't like it , you can get about what you paid for it on eBay . I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one . Senneheiser 's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look . The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice . These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they 'd still be around for another 20 years at least ."}, "26100": {"id": "26099", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I love these clip on , vibration reading tuners , This was the second one I tried , The first was a Barcus Berry , which worked equally well , They both have lots of features , such as tap tempo , up and down tuning adjustments .

It 's built extremely well and has some weight to it , but you 'd have no problem carrying it to a small gig . A 5 watt tube amp is still quite LOUD , so the attenuator is a god-send.How does it sound you ask ? Tone is subjective , but to my ears it can get quite `` Marshally '' without a lot of work with a Les Paul as well as a Tele . I do n't own a Strat , so I ca n't comment on single coils through it . On the 1 watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about 5 I had a damn good `` Back In Black '' style hard rock tone .

This thing is way smaller than I expected . I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it does n't take up a lot of desk space . It fits well where I put it.2 . It works as intended . I use this with a GLS ES-57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good . I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60 % . I have no hissing and no problems . I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co-host ( we do it over Skype ) said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good . This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball.3 . It 's plug and play . I plugged it in , it installed the drivers , and it automatically set itself as the default microphone . Easy peasy.4 . I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately.5 . The dials and everything was easy to understand.Cons1 . You ca n't plug this into a USB hub ( or even an AC-powered USB hub ) otherwise you 'll get a hiss . This needs to be plugged directly into a computer.2 . This high-jacks your audio defaults in Windows . To fix it , open your Control Panel , open the Sound , and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem . Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended . Since I use this as my main mic , I left it as default in the Sound settings.Overall , for the price , this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs . I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and I 'm on a budget . It 's a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money . If you 're like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts , this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person . Worth every penny as long as it lasts .

It makes my tube halfstack sing , and my practice amp sound like a big amp.Its great as a stand alone distortion , running on a clean amp . It can get everything from that perfect bluesy grit to roaring sludge ( just max out the distortion and use your neck pickup on an LP to sound EXACTLY like King Buzzo of the Melvins ) and everything inbetween.It can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory . Case in point , my buddy has an old Peavy stack from the 70 's in his garage . Its a solid state head on top of a vertical cab of two 14 '' speakers . On its own , you can use the gain and distortion knobs present on the amp to get a decent sound , but with his Les Paul it still sounded oddly dark . We put the Rat in front of it and with some fiddling got that perfect AC/DC style overdrive out of it.I think the main reason I love the Rat so much is not only the great tone and its sheer indestructability , but the filter knob . Normal tone knobs allow you to focus more on bass or treble , but usually if you boost one , you cut the other . The filter is more of a high end roll off , you can darken or brighten your tone accordingly , but when you DO go brighter , you still have the same bottom end . It does n't CUT the bass out . So even with a more treble heavy sound , you still have a fuller rounder tone , it does n't thin out so much.Its really an excellent pedal .

As banged up as a Manhasset can get from week-end warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home , I 've never had one fail on me over the past 40+ years . There 's nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust , yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension , preventing 5-10 pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward . But the `` rub '' is their non-adaptability . The feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music . Consequently , these ubiquitous , well-proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan , especially with a couple of keyboards , amps , instrument stands , and other requisite gear on board.This is where Amazon 's On-Stage Music Stand becomes attractive ( of course , it does n't hurt that it costs less than a Manhasset ) . It permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music . Consequently , it 's much easier to find a convenient place -- whether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat -- for packing the stand . Simply `` slide '' it into position.The drawback -- apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about ( be careful not to over-tighten those set-screws ! ) -- is that this thing is heavy . Frankly , I was expecting a lightweight stand , at least compared to my old Manhasset , but if you 've owned or been around the latter , the first thing you 're likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable , substantial addition in weight . At the same time , with the moving parts and the set screws ( topped by plastic , rotating , serrated wheels ) , the On-Stage stand does n't give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhasset -- in other words , I 'm very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear-pile after a long , exhausting 4-hour gig.Bottom line : the On-Stage appears to be a good value -- a truly heavy-duty stand ( in most respects ) that 'll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs . But do n't expect it to lighten your load or , simply because it 's heavier , to last longer than a Manhasset.If you do a lot of traveling and do n't plan to put one of those 1000-page piano folders on the stand , there 's at least one truly lightweight ( albeit plastic ) stand that 's worked out really well for me ( perhaps needless to say , some have n't -- they fall apart or they 're so ingeniously designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving , pint-sized cases ) . But the Peak stand is made to hold up ( in turn , it holds up relatively heavy music books ) and has served me well for several years ( just as I was about to condemn the stand , I called the company , they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped , and the Peak stand has been problem-free ever since ) . It 'll cost you a bit more , but not as much as some folks are willing to spend in exchange for losing a few unwanted pounds ."}, "26177": {"id": "26176", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I 've read the revues and some do n't do them justice .

But it 's really minimal and I did not notice a huge difference pressure wise . The material is nicer/softer than the original so that is a plus . Every so often I would flip the headphones around to see if I could tell anything . The larger pad does cover more of the ear- almost surrounds it . But seriously , if you had me blindfolded I would n't bet my life that I always knew which side were which . But in general the large pad and softer material seems to be a better set up . I ca n't imagine any set of cans actually feeling comfortable to have on for an extended period of time.Sound difference ? Yes , one side in my test sounded better I felt ... until I switched them around ! Just like eyes your two ears are not 100 % equal and over time they lose their edge but not at equal rates .

Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs , connect a mic or ( apparently ) a `` low-headroom '' instrument to it , run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters . It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program , and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton , but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless . ( Ableton itself is rather dodgy , and seems to crash constantly . ) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely , so as no audio is being produced from my monitors ! I was n't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR , an Ableton problem , or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers , so after the gazillionth crash , I screamed `` Ballsdogit ! ! ! `` , and purchased a license for Reaper . After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months , I began to realize that my monitors no longer `` lock up '' , but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic ! ! ! I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors . Now I 'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers . Garbage focusrite ! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins , and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface . I have yet to experience a crash , but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously , I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2 , and came across a response from David @ focusrite actually saying that `` you should not use this setup to record electric guitar.. '' , and that if you need to record electric guitar you should `` get something with more headroom like the 2i4 . '' That is just unbelievable in my eyes ! I 'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop , but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle ? Besides that , I 'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers ! This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins . There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation , and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit . I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer , now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology . HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING ! ! ! ? ? ? ? The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm . I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 ( when not crashing or locking up the monitors ) seems to handle all of them well . I constantly check for driver updates , and have the latest drivers for the 2i2 , but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite , you dropped the ball here ."}, "26312": {"id": "26311", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I got this for my Boss Loop Station , but it does n't work very well .

A work-around for the main issue follows the review . The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1 ) Quality : Very weak soft-metal screws . Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with . 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later , causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2 ) Engineering : The instructions recommend , and the screws ( the ones that come with the straplocks ) are designed for a # 2 Phillips screwdriver . However , a standard # 2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons . So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit , or using a # 1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3 ) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar . The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch . Therefore any lateral stress ( i.e . weight of the guitar ) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw . A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it ( half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course ) . Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically , if the screws were n't total crap , this might have been a 3 or 4 star review . Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver wo n't fit and get the things properly installed , it would probably work out for most people . So if you are stuck with a set , here 's what I recommend : Go to a hardware store and buy # 6 x 1 '' oval-head stainless steel replacement screws . Note that these wo n't fit properly , but they are the closest match and can be modified . ( They are 21 cents each at my local stores , and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this . ) Put the screw into an electric drill ( pointy end in ) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill . Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head . It does n't need much . I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each . While you are at it , file down a cheap # 2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal , and recommend that your friends try a different brand !"}, "26330": {"id": "26329", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home `` 12/23/11 '' and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset , i would not returned because i do n't feel like fighting with no body but they should n't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for ."}, "26331": {"id": "26330", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap , the first one arrived in non working condition , wires inside werent even soldered , so i ordered a replacement , plugged it in and it didnt work either , the second wasnt soldered either.I know its cheap , but i expected it to at least work , do not buy"}, "26332": {"id": "26331", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Well , what can I say ?

It 's awkward to apply and remove quickly . It 's visually distracting for player and audience , and it does n't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.The only possible justification I can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck - but even that does n't fly . Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and , unless you 're avoiding playing that first fret ( or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position ) you 're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand . I own the older Planet Waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.Otherwise the construction of the NS Artist Capo is superb . The surface is arched , probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various Strat fingerboards as well as a flatter SG/LP style . It does n't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1 which is virtually the same as a classical . If I cranked the tension it 's possible the rubber would flatten out but I would n't risk marring the neck wood.I tried both the pick and tuner clips and they 're functional , but to be honest I would n't use either - too distracting and I only use tuners to get an initial A , then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments , depending on what they are.The only other capo I 've ever used that protudes outward is the Kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence ' design . I have one and , as good as the holding action is , I 've never felt comfortable with the design .

It was brand new , unopened , in box . They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase . In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.However , it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store , and that store was VERY busy and noisy . It 's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.This is indeed a 6-string ukulele . It measures a bit over 28 '' top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke . I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range . The advantage to this of course is it 's 6 string , so if you 're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering ... . that is of course , until you realize that while it has 6 strings , it is not tuned like a guitar . It 's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE . One can not simply play guitar music on this instrument ; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned . Being a total newbie to ukes , this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions . So my primary purpose in purchasing this -- to have a small portable guitar , hit a snag.Now that 's not totally the end of the thing , because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning . It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one does n't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup . So all is not lost there . It was just an unexpected surprise -- mainly because I did n't research the instrument prior to purchase ( it 's rare that I impulse buy ) .So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument . That 's where the Yamaha really falls short . This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand . There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box . That this was a `` rush job '' out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.There are no strap pegs ; those will require being added by hand ( not difficult , but extra expense and time ) .The action is of course too high . That 's not unusual -- in truth it 's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise . But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.However , the thing that bothers me the most : if I was n't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele ... I 'd think it 's was a cheap knock-off child 's guitar . There 's not one thing about this instrument that says `` quality '' -- which is quite disappointing . This instrument sells for about $ 100 . That low cost is obvious . This is a `` cheap guitar '' in every way . I ca n't honestly say it 's a toy , but it reeks `` beginner instrument '' . The tuners are as cheap as they come , the finish is cheap , there is no decoration , no protective edging . The finish is -- unfinished.I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon -- and I respect those reviews . People have different tastes and for some folks this has a `` home made '' feel that they will love . However I 've been playing guitar for ( mumblety mumble ) deca ... uh ... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap . I own two Ovation guitars , a Peavey electric bass , a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke ( which is of such higher quality it 's not even a contest . And no I 'm not hawking Epiphone . Facts is facts , that 's all . You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon ) .When I got this home and took a good look at it , I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship , nothing that said anything more than `` this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible '' . In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.Other than those two factors , one can find $ 40- $ 50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality . The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice -- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke . Other than its portability , I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price ... consider it over-priced ( or rather , under-made ) .One must grant it 's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation . But low quality is low quality . ( Edit two weeks later : I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store -- a direct competition to this instrument . The Cordoba is MUCH nicer . It 's built better , has better sound , and is finished out much more nicely . Sorry Yamaha , but facts is facts . Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side , I 'd have bought and kept the Cordoba . ) That 's my honest review . I know some will disagree . But others know exactly what I mean . This is n't an expensive instrument so one really ca n't expect super-fine quality at this price . However -- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom . As mentioned , the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it . I simply can not recommend this instrument unless there are no better options -- and frankly , there are ."}, "26355": {"id": "26354", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy , read cheap , interface to record some instruments with .

Its snake-head headstock with the tiny , not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking , and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars , and this makes the guitar heavier and , to me , less & # 34 ; alive & # 34 ; /resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force , but at a heavy strum , the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I 've not encountered before.- I can get the action very , very low before the frets rattle - nice ! All in all , it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it 's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said , just because it comes from Canada does n't embody it with mystical vibes .

This is your deal . `` I strongly disagree . You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $ 100 or less , even a few near or under the $ 40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I 've played guitar for over 10 years . Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1 . Afterall , everyone talks about them , they 're available at any given music store in the nation , you hear about all these famous musicians using them , plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap ! So I snapped one up just like everyone else . Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR , that does n't always mean its GOOD ( see : Nickelback , the Transformers movie franchise , the Kardashian family , etc ... ) .So I plugged it in and did n't really care for it . The distortion was harsh , thin , artificial sounding and always noisy . I tried it on both my amps ( My practic amp : a solid state Fender Frontman 25R , and my big amp , the B-52 AT100 , which is a 100w tube halfstack ) It was was not very diverse , and the basic sound was not very likeable to me . I 've read the Japanese made DS-1 's are better in sound than the newer , made in Taiwan models but , either way , the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But , like many newer players , I did n't know any better at the time . Fast forward a few years and I 've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals . There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1 . All of them are great general purpose distortions , easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops , and can , at the time of this writing , be bought brand new for $ 75 or less here on good ol ' Amazon.com , and are rugged enough to last for years : Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion : Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I 'm a Boss hater ( I 'm certainly not , I loved the TU-3 , the ODB-3 , the MD-2 , and the XT-2 , among others ) I 'll start with the DS-1 's big brother . This pedal has a much nicer tone to it , not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes . The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1 , the II setting is a brighter , richer tone . As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity , you can find DS-2 's all over ebay for very cheap prices . A very worthy pedal , unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2 : Great dirty distortion pedal . Probably my personal favorite . You 've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years , its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists . Its a rich , full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy . I 've never heard a bad tone out of mine . Its great for getting a `` big amp '' kind of sound out of a small practice amp . Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume . A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff : The Big Muff is another pedal you 've heard on hundreds of songs . Its kind of a fuzz , kind of a distortion , but definitely owns its own sonic territory . Very big , saturated and warm . Used heavily in the 70 's for classic rock tones , also in the 90 's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage . Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins , Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White . I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff , not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue , its smaller , uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER ! A great pedal.MXR Distortion + : The Distortion + is a great first distortion , and can usually be found pretty cheap . Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything , and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent , i.e . you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp , it does n't cover over your equipments sound . Used by quite a few famous folks , including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia , Randy Rhoads ( Ozzy 's famous guitarist ) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal : Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal , NOT the Metal II . That 's a fine pedal as well , but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal . The Cool Cat Metal , or CM-1 , is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals . Basically , its a pre-amp that sits on the floor . It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof . So you can do anything from a clean boost ( with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone ) to high gain metal stuff , with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between . It works well with any amp I 've tried it on , and you can find tons of great sounds . Its an unbelievably versatile pedal , and its even true bypass . The best part is , Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them , so you can easily find one used or even new for under $ 30 . A true hidden gem that 's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion : This little guy surprised me . Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box , and , if so , that must be one awesome pedal too . Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box , and boy does it ever succeed at that . Great crunch , tons of volume and gain , it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin ' stack ! It even sounded good going into my modeling amp ( very few pedals work well with my modeling amp , and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in ) , and you can get a brand new one for $ 40 shipped , fantastic ! Speaking of Joyo , I 've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN , another Chinese pedal maker , and I 'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag ( especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I 've ever played through ) . So JOYO and MOEN , they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz , od , and dirt pedals , check them out ( and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company , please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review , DS-1 included , are made in America , let alone the western hemisphere ) .Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for . Also , if you ca n't actually try a pedal out at the store , YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs , than more power to you . Tone is subjective , every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps , and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love , that 's okay . My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information . You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals , the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that 's affordable . Find something you truly love and buy that . If its the DS-1 , one of the pedals I 've mentioned here , or anything else , the important part is that it sounds right to YOU ."}, "26405": {"id": "26404", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "My first desk mic stand , and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use .

My friend 's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well . The edges did not `` catch '' completely and it looks terrible.My classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole , it did not fit at all . You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboard.The main issue is the sound.Yes , it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming , slightly but enough to tell.However , it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.Fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before , even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.For me , that does not justify it.A simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.Another thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.The packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened .

I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board , and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply . However , if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested , you 're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all , regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board . The fitment to the power supply is there ... sort of . There 's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together . I was n't worried about this , since I doubt I 'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is , the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter . Once you 've got them in ( or attempted to do so ) , they 're never coming out . You 'll probably have to break them . It 's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this . Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board ( it can only go one place ) , you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply do n't fit the mounting location on this board . You ca n't plug them in because there 's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own , but given that it does n't fit like it 's supposed to , I wish I could return this board - except I ca n't , because it now has holes drilled in it .

The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on ... I 've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it , even when there was no guitar plugged in ... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes ; very distracting and it drove me nuts ! This is n't a ground loop issue ( my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond ) , it 's clearly a defect with this product . Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse , again , even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume . You 'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil , but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS . WTF ? The next issue is the weird `` fizz '' sound , that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string , instead of a clean note , there 's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that `` surrounds '' the note , and fades as the string stops moving . It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency . Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is , neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in , or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in ... but I 'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans . I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12 '' Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites ( there 's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting ) and you 'll find that these amps are having issues . Apparently , the Mustang I and II do n't have these issues , and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp . Is this a hardware issue , software issue , speaker issue ? There is speculation that the LCD screen ( which is not present on the I or II ) may be causing problems , but no one seems to know for sure and Fender does n't seem to care ... Definitely try this before you buy it . You may get an amp that does n't have these problems , you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care ; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds , and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps , but in my opinion , technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage . I am disappointed that Fender has n't yet correct what ever is wrong ( some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong , but I 'm not taking that as a fact ... ) , but they have acknowledged that there is `` something '' wrong.Whatever ... I took this back after a few days of playing with it , trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success ( the built-in noise gate helps a little , but sucks tone ) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead . Guess what ? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz , even when cranked . How about that ? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels , there is minimal noise.I 'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it , but they do have some other nice amps that I 'd like to try .

With that being said , I have to say that I was , as many reviewers have noted , in slight awe when we opened Dominion Dark Ages and saw all of the additional cards , 35 additional sets as I recall.I have now played Dominion Dark Ages a handful of times , and my initial impression is that though it 's an impressively large expansion , bigger does not always mean better.I guess my less than enthusiastic endorsement of this expansion comes because we have come to enjoy the up-tempo play that comes from playing with cards from Prosperity where it is relatively easy to accumulate treasure and lots of it fairly quickly . I found that Dark Ages is a more plodding version of the game . I mean , I can never seem to get any traction , especially as the game begins , plus I really miss having Estate cards in the mix . The three cards that are substituted for Estates in Dark Ages are IMO whole unsatisfying at best and largely useless at the worst.I have to agree that some of the action cards add new and interesting twists to this game , but my experience so far is that Dark Ages is a new , but somewhat lackluster addition to this fine base game.My favorite Dominion expansions ( these are the only ones we 've played ) in order from favorite to least favorite are:1 ) Prosperity2 ) Seaside3 ) Intrigue4 ) Hinterlands5 ) Dark AgesI know Dark Ages fans out there will disagree , but this is my experience , and perhaps it will be useful to someone who 's considering their next expansion .

Do n't play it with those brand new to the game as many of the card mechanics may be too much to grasp for novices . Save it til they get used to the other expansions and then watch their eyes light up . For experienced players , however , right out of the box , you know you 've got something special here . It 's a game-changing set focusing on a grim-n-gritty Dark Ages theme that concentrates a lot of its efforts on trashing cards for fun and profit.Shelters replace starting estates ( one is useful as it gives +2 actions , the other two either provide +1 card when you trash them or a way to trash them when you buy a Victory card ) . You ca n't get more Shelters than the three you begin with and Estates are still available to buy.Ruins are a new action card supply pile that provide crappy bonuses . These get dished out like Curses through attack cards and are meant to clog up opponents ' hands . Ex : +1 card , or +1 buy , or look at the top 2 cards of your draw pile and keep or discard them ) . One card , Death Cart , self-inlicts two ruins on you when you buy it , but it acts as a Platinum ( +5 money ) and only costs 4 money to get . But you must trash an action card from your hand when you play it or else you trash the Death Cart after playing it.Spoils are a new , self-replenishing supply pile that act as temporary , one-use Gold ( +3 money ) . You get spoils two ways , one by playing Bandit Camp ( +1 card , + actions , +1 spoils ) , or the new attack card , Pillage ( +2 spoils , look @ your opponents ' hands and choose one card to discard ) .Two new supply piles are Urchin ( attack ) and Hermit ( action ) . Trashing either of them allows you to upgrade them into a Mercenary ( attack card ) or Madman ( action ) . That 's the only way to get these powerful cards.There are also Knights , one supply pile of 10 unique male and female knights ( attack cards ) . They trash opponents 's cards ( top two cards from draw pile revealed , opponent chooses which one to trash if it 's value is between 3-6 money , discards the rest ) . But knight cards trash each other if an attacked opponent chooses to trash a revealed knight from his draw pile.Rats are a 20-card supply pile ( +1 card , +1 action ) that let you trash cards but playing them makes you gain another Rats and they can chew through your deck if you 're not careful . That 's because you can trash anything except Rats with this card ! So you 'll need a different card that lets you trash the Rats if you really want to take advantage of it without being overrun . Self-control is another option ... you do n't have to play the Rats just because it 's in your hand , but +1 Card , +1 Action is hard to pass up . . .That 's the basics . You get two awesome new reaction cards , one new Victory card ( worth 1 VP for every 3 silvers in your deck ) , and one cool new Treasure card ( Counterfeit , +1 money , +1 Buy , lets you play a treasure twice then trashes it ) . The rest of the new cards are ( mostly ) action or ( about a half-dozen ) attack cards . Most of the cards in this expansion are incredibly fun , some are a bit fussy and complicated ( at least at first ) , and a few are a bit boring , but experienced players ca n't go wrong with this set . It 's got a bunch of `` must-have '' cards in it like all the big box expansions : Intrigue , Seaside , Prosperity , and Hinterlands . The only non-essential sets are Alchemy and Cornucopia , the two small box expansions , although they both have some fun cards in them.Note that Dark Ages is not a standalone game .

A couple observations based on our initial experience.1 ) To get maximum enjoyment out of this deck , I think you have to carefully choose kingdom cards that complement each other . I would not recommend using the randomizer deck to pick Kingdom cards.2 ) There is more interaction among players with this expansion than in some other sets . Your opponents will try to force you to trash good cards while clogging your hand with weak cards.3 ) Because players will continually be weakening each others ' hands , games with this expansion can last a bit longer.4 ) A few cards , like Death Cart , are extremely powerful and it is a good idea to include them in kingdom card sets used for individual games , or games could really drag on.5 ) We liked the concepts or shelters and ruins , and the focus on the trash pile . They add new dimensions to the game.6 ) The functions and capabilities of individual cards are well-linked to the titles of the cards .

The Dark Ages set is the first additional set I 've ordered , but I have been able to gain familiarity with all the other sets by playing Dominion on-line ( which I learned about from a nifty card included in the Dark Ages box ) .Dark Ages presumes humble beginnings and a & # 34 ; hard times & # 34 ; economy , which is a refreshing change from the ( over- ) abundance of wealth in Prosperity and the mind-boggling complexity of Alchemy ( e.g. , Possession ) . Much of the game action involves trashing cards , and sifting through the trash . We really enjoy the wide variety of new game functions and mechanics ( Knight attacks to trash opponents ' cards , Hermit converting to Madman , Urchin converting to Mercenary , Rogue trash retrievals , etc. ) . As the game unfolds and your deck grows ( or shrinks , depending ) , you really get a feeling of well-deserved progress.Having played on-line with all the various Dominion expansions , I can say without hesitation that games with Dark Ages cards are the most fun , fair , and balanced . Strategies for success can vary widely ( I still ca n't figure out how to make Rats work without destroying my entire deck , but I have seen another player use it to good effect ) . With other sets , experienced players can exploit a single overpowered and under-priced card ( Baker , Bridge , Bishop -- do they all start with 'B ' ? ) to run away with it . Have n't seen anyone do that yet with Dark Ages.Aesthetically speaking , the cards are beautifully depicted and feature some real eye-catching graphics . A few of the Knights are a little hokey ( did they just Photoshop pictures of family members ? ) , but that 's in keeping with Dominion 's occasional tongue-in-cheek humor.I was n't sure whether the Dominion team had already exhausted their imaginations , considering how many expansions preceded this one , but rest assured : Dark Ages brings a lot of new life ( and plenty of death ) to the Dominion franchise ."}, "26501": {"id": "26500", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Ok. here is my ranking for Dominion sets:1 .

Prosperity ( this expansions cards are way too powerful for my taste , but it introduces some nice elements . we like adding a prosperity card or two to our games ) 5 .

Hinterlands - this set has a lot of complicated cards . this does n't mean they are bad ; i like a lot of these cards , but they are a little bit more finicky , and it takes some practice to incorporate these cards effectively into your decks.7 . Alchemy - this is completely irrelevant at this point , because it introduces potions as a currency , which is not used in any successive set . If you buy alchemy , prepare to have games dominated by Alchemy cards . This is an & # 34 ; all or nothing & # 34 ; expansion ."}, "26502": {"id": "26501", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Dominion : Dark Ages is the 7th and penultimate expansion for the deck-building game Dominion . Dark Ages is NOT a standalone expansion , meaning you will need Dominion , Dominion : Intrigue , or Dominion : Base Cards to play with this set . That being said , Dark Ages is a very robust expansion with lots to offer . It includes 35 new kingodm decks ( 34 are actions , and 1 is victory ) , making it the biggest expansion of the series . The theme of this set is a bit more doom and gloom than previous releases . As much as Dominion : Prosperity is about wealth and good fortune , this set is about the dregs of society and the squalor it thrives in . Many of the cards ' names fit well with this theme : Beggar , Death Cart , Graverobber , Hermit , Junk Dealer , Rats , Scavenger , Vagrant , etc.As far as new mechanics and new twists to the original game , Dark Ages has plenty of them . First off , it includes Shelters , which are cards that replace the Estates in your starting deck . They 're worthless in terms of victory points , but give you little bonuses that can come into play during the game . For the first time in any set , none of the cards hand out Curses . Instead , a few cards hand out Ruins , which are essentially dead cards in your deck that provide the smallest of benefits . Also , some cards gain you Spoils , which are essentially one-time-use Golds.Looking at the new kingdom decks , the big theme here is the Trash . Some trash your own cards , some trash your opponents ' cards , some trash themselves , some allow you to get things out of the trash ( a first in Dominion ) , and some give you a benefit when they get trashed . Obviously , if you like trashing cards in Dominion , you 'll love this set ; if you do n't like the trashing concept , steer clear of this expansion.What else is new ? Well , one of the kingdom decks - Rats - includes 20 cards , making it the only kingodm deck to include more than 12 cards . Another kingdom deck - Knights - is made up of 10 unique cards . A couple other kingdom decks allow you to gain cards from their own special non-supply piles . This has been done before with Tournament from Dominion : Cornucopia , but the special piles in Dark Ages are full 10-card decks.In short , Dark Ages provides a wealth of variety , mechanics , strategy , and tactics to an already deep game system . If you like Dominion and its expansions , you 'll no doubt like Dark Ages as well . If you 're new to Dominion , this may not be your best choice for getting deeper into the game .

While it looked somewhat interesting , I just thought the whole ` cards that do something when you trash them ' mechanic was overrated and the theme was depressing . Well , I was wrong . After about a half dozen plays , I can say that Dark Ages is an excellent expansion.While cards like ` Death Cart ' , ` Marauder ' , ` Madman ' , and ` Rats ' are n't exactly a ray of sunshine , they add balance to the Dominion series at a whole . There are some positive cards in here ( i.e . ` Sage ' , ` Rebuild ' ) , but whereas Hinterlands breathed new life into old cards by introducing new ways to play and combine them , Dark Ages treats cards in a utilitarian manner . It also expands ( and inverts ) the dual `` now and later '' balance of cards that began in Hinterlands.As other reviewers have mentioned , this expansion is not aimed at introductory players . Even seasoned players may have to reread some cards ( and the write-ups in the rule book for those cards ) the first few times it 's played , but it soon becomes second nature . There are some cards that are more straightforward , too , creating a nice mix . And , as is the case with my favorite sets ( Intrigue , Hinterlands , and Seaside ) , Dark Ages is excellent by itself and when paired with other sets ( the two recommended games for Dark Ages/Cornucopia are fantastic ) .To conclude , this is a big expansion that was worth the wait for fans of the game ( of which I am one ) . If the increased complexity of Cornucopia and/or Hinterlands leaves you cold , you 'll probably want to avoid this set . But if , like me , you enjoy the challenge and variety that this kind of complexity brings to the game , RUN to the store to get this !

Each base set comes with 25 distinct kingdom cards . The average expansion ( other than the horrid Alchemy and the rushed Cornucopia ) provided 25 . This set comes with 35 distinct kingdom cards ( one of which -- knights -- is a stack of ten unique cards that are played as a single kingdom stack ) , three alternatives to the three starting estates , and three cards that act like kingdom cards but are only accessed via other cards . This expansion feels mind-blowingly large because it is . For reference , here is a chronological list of expansions and the number of kingdom cards that they came with : Dominion had 25kingdoms ( 2008 ) Intrigue had 25kingdoms ( 2009 ) Seaside had 26kingdoms ( 2009 ) Alchemy had 15kingdoms ( 2010 ) Prosperity had 25kingdoms ( 2010 ) Cornucopia had 13kingdoms ( 2011 ) Hinterlands had 26kingdoms ( 2012 ) Dark Ages has 35kingdoms ( 2012 ) The set introduces a few new types of cardsShelters - these function as alternatives to the three estate cards that players normally start with in their deck . They are slightly less detrimental because they each do something small ( some are +action , some give you things for trashing them , etc ) . There are three different typesRuins - these are like shelters in the fact that they are under-powered cards . They function somewhere between [ estates ] ( which give a small victory point reward but clog up your hand ) and curses ( which both hurt you and clog up your hand ) . They clog up your hand slightly , do n't award victory points , but have some powers in the game . They are usually under-powered compared to kingdom cards in the supply so they do n't hurt as much as a curses but water down the power of your deck . Usually you give them to other players when you pillage or ransack them , but sometimes ( like the [ Death Wagon ] , they come with another kingdom card.Knights- these act like a normal kingdom cards in that they are put out in a stack of 10 , but only the top card is visible and each card in the stack is unique ( each has its own name e.g . [ sir michel ] and power ) . Basically its just ten different kingdom cards stacked as one to add more variability to the game . [ Rats ] - these are traditional action cards in every way except that they self-replicate , eat through your deck ( make you trash a card ) and there are 20 instead of 10 of them . [ Hermit ] / [ Madman ] - When you have [ Hermits ] in your game , you will also pull out a pile of [ Madman ] cards . When you use a [ Hermit ] and fail to buy a card that turn , the [ Hermit ] turns into a [ Madman ] ( you trash the [ Hermit ] and get a [ Madman ] from another stack ( [ Madman ] , [ Mercenary ] and [ Spoils ] are all action or treasure cards that can only be acquired via other cards and do n't count toward the 10 kingdom limit or game-end conditions . Its an interesting mechanic where hermits can go mad and madmen go out in a blaze of glory . [ Urchin ] / [ Mercenary ] - When/if you play with the [ Urchin ] card , you also pull out a stack of [ Mercenary ] cards . [ Mercenaries ] are not part of supply and can only be acquired via an [ Urchin ] . The gist is that if an [ Urchin ] aims high ( takes on multiple tasks/actions in a single turn ] then he becomes a [ mercenary ] ( trash the [ Urchin ] and get a { mercenary ] [ Spoils ] - these are not in the supply and can only be acquired by cards that pillage or ransack others . [ Spoils ] are basically a single-use [ gold ] . Pillaging means that other players discard cards and you put a [ spoils ] card in your discard pile . Ransacking means you give every other player a Ruin card and you gain a [ Spoils ] . When the [ Spoils ] appears in your hand , you use it for +3 coin and instead of discarding it to your discard pile , you discard it back to the [ spoils ] stack from whence it came.When trashed - many of these cards have a power that is only used when the card is trashed ( whether voluntarily as a strategy or involuntarily ) . This adds a lot of interesting strategy particularly with Hinterlands and Seaside.Trash as power - [ Death Cart ] is an extremely powerful card that requires you to trash an action card . If you do n't , you trash it at the end of that turn . Cards like [ Procession ] allow you , amongst other things , to use an action card twice ( a la [ throne room ] , but if you double an action , you trash that card . Both are examples of trash `` powering '' or `` powering up '' cards.So is it fun ? Yes it is . We played three games with Dark-Ages-only sets and two games with sets mixed with Dark-Ages cards last night ( after getting it via two-day shipping and we had a blast . The game plays very well with itself , and played interestingly with other cards . On one of the games , the mix was n't optimal because we had many cards to put things into the trash , but nothing to trash them or get them out of the trash . Overall , the cards are very versatile for almost every setup , and its far from the harshly-limited alchemy expansion , but you will want to play with at least one card that causes players to trash cards ( from any expansion ) and at least one that benefits from being trashed . Pulling cards from the trash is optional , but makes for a fun dynamic.The good+++You get a TON of variety here and a TON of content++Cards feel unique and fun++As with almost all Dominion sets , the card name , card art and card mechanic all work flawlessly together++Unique expansion feel ( poverty , destruction , underground and rebirth ) ++interesting new mechanics introduced++great art+It actually helps make some of the less-viable Cornucopia cards more viableThe bad-some cards are n't as fun without being matched with others ( which could be said about almost any set ) . It 's far from the train-wreck that is Alchemy.-Some cards are a little less inspired-Some games felt a little `` impoverished '' and bogged down . We did n't have a lot of money or our hands were filled with under-powered ruins . It fits the expansion feel well , but I tend to favor the power-play games rather than the games where everyone scrapes along toward victory -- this is totally subjective.Overall , the cards are great , but just a notch below Prosperity , Seaside and Hinterlands . There is just so much variety and content , though . If it was a smaller set like Conucopia , I 'd put it at the bottom of the list with Cornucopia . As it is , this is the single biggest expansion to date and introduces so many new ideas that the sheer quanitity of original content makes up for the quality of some of the cards.1 ) Intrigue ( the better base set ) 2 ) Prosperity ( the highest quality expansion set ) 3 ) Dark-Ages ( the expansion with the most new ideas ) 4 ) Seaside ( the second best in terms of quality ) 5 ) Hinterlands ( the quirkiest and most bizarre but often overpowered ) 6 ) Cornucopia ( a little blah and TINY ) and just skip Alchemy altogether .

The extra pieces , AKA sea dragons do add an extra element to the game but also drag it out much longer and create a lot of randomness that simple did not exist in the original .

For one , you can play the original Tsuro on it by branching off a 66 portion of the board and removing all of the duplicate wake tiles . One of the daikaiju tiles can be used as the dragon tile . It takes a little work , but it can be done . Players can also play with the 77 grid without the daikaiju tiles , if they wish . Like Tsuro , this game 's visuals are fantastic and appropriately themed ... everything from the sharp blue colors on the board to the font style of the text in the manual.While the general idea between both games remain the same , the daikaiju tiles definitely add a strategic element that was n't present in the original Tsuro . In Tsuro , I often found that players were playing against themselves as opposed to each other . Each player often branched off on their own for the majority of the game , trying to centralize themselves or put themselves on a path that would guarantee that they had plenty of moves left ahead of them . In the end , it often came down to who had the most moves remaining before they were forced off of the board . Daikaiju tiles can eliminate players regardless of a player 's position on the board , forcing players to operate outside of the normal line of thinking when planning their `` path '' in their head . Daikaiju tiles also destroy wake tiles , reshaping the board on the fly . In some instances , they even extend the length of the game as they give players opportunities to place tiles on spaces that have already been obliterated.As expected , the family got a kick out of Tsuro of the Seas . They got pretty good at the original Tsuro , but had to adjust their strategy a bit when confronted with the daikaiju tiles . Some of them opted to stay along the outside of the board away from everyone else while others tried to stay in the center and away from those deadly edges . Vinnie ( 11 ) was immediately drawn to the art and could n't wait to play . We played with and without the daikaiju tiles ... the former for when we wanted a chaotic game and the latter for when we wanted a semi-structured , old school game of Tsuro . If we want something in between , we 'll start the game off with three daikaiju tiles instead of six in a two to four player game , just as an example . We also came up with variants that gave us `` extra lives '' to prevent early elimination . The game allows us to be flexible in that regard , something I whole-heartedly appreciate as a father to ADHD children.Overall , Tsuro of the Seas keeps the saga going superbly . Like its predecessor , it 's easy and quick to play , making it a fun game to bring out on family game night . For those of you who already own Tsuro and are questioning whether or not they should drop money on a new , similar product , my advice is to take a look at how often you play Tsuro . If Tsuro has been sitting on your shelf for months without being touched , then you may not want to make the investment . However , if you get a lot of mileage out of Tsuro and want to mix things up a bit with a slightly different version , then you ca n't go wrong with Tsuro of the Seas ."}, "26511": {"id": "26510", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "This is a quality game that 's perfect when you want to get a strategy game in , but do n't have a ton of time ( it only takes about a half hour ) .

If you rolled a 6,7,8 then roll one die , if it is a 6 , place a new dikiju on the board same as you did to set up the game .

I could n't give it five stars because the boat/iceburg are really cheap and flimsy . My son popped the floor of the boat out trying to put on one of the masts . The masts also do n't fit very well . It does n't take much for them to fall down.All in all , it 's a great gift idea for all ages ."}, "26529": {"id": "26528", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "I played this game with my mom ( I am 29 ) and we had quite a blast , especially since I kept losing . The object of the game is simple , place all your penguins on the pirate ship without tipping it so all the penguins fall off . It is harder than it sounds , although once you get the hang of it the game is very amusing . We only managed to get all the penguins ( 16 ) on once . The game seems quite durable and if you are looking for a challenge start with the ship slightly off kilter for a tougher game . I think any person over the age of 5 ( which the starting recommended age for this ) would have fun trying to balance this ship . The other thing about this is you can actually play it by yourself and see how many you can put on the ship without it tipping . One thing I do agree is that several reviewers have said the game gets old after a half hour but I think when you pull it out a week or so later and play it again , you will have just as much fun as the first time .

The younger kids love to simply place the penguins as quickly as possible , hoping to rock the boat and watch the penguins dive overboard . The older kids have fun strategically placing their penguins while trying to take up space so the next player will rock the boat . It is definitely repetitive , but kids 3-5 will love playing it over and over , and the 6-8 age group will enjoy trying to just trying to win .

They make up their own games , when we 're not playing the official one , and have pretend adventures with the black and white bird crew.The set-up and game playng are simple . Take turns trying to balance penguins and ship . Practice improves play , and we try to keep it lighthearted and not frustrating . Actually , the kids seem to prefer it when they do spill everything . Lots of laughs , not a whole lot of education here , maybe some fine motor skills.Also , we recommend handicapping the better or more mature players , e.g. , use only your non-dominant hand , face away and stretch your arms from behind your back while looking over your shoulder , stand on one leg ( Walking the Plank Method ) and balance a book on you head while placing the penguins , and for severe test of skills or punishment- wear a blindfold . The options are practically endless , but let the little ones have a fair shot , i.e. , let them win !

You do n't want to be the first player that knocks the penguin overboard . I think the older version may have been a little easier to play , however , all in all I liked the game.This game works on fine motor dexterity , problem solving and visual spatial skills . Your impulsive children may become frustrated as it does take more of a steady hand than some of the reviews have indicated . This game can also be used for positioning , reach and release and as part of an obstacle course ( bring penguin through a maze and place on the ship ) .

After playing with it for a couple hours it does n't show any signs of falling apart , so I 'm feeling good about the durability.The online video shows penguins sitting out on the yardarms , but I ca n't figure out how to do that without putting two penguins down at once so we changed the rules of the game to permit this.It 's a lot of fun trying to get all the penguins onto the ship without spilling , and it 's a lot of fun when they spill .

Not to mention my huge mastiff dog , waiting with bated breath to gobble all the little black and white pirate penguins . You must place the penguins standing up on the ship , if they fall down on board , keep playing , if one falls off the ship the game is over and the person going before the one who caused the ship to tip is the winner .

The game play is relatively straightforward : ( 1 ) collect cards that give you points , ( 2 ) flip over cards that depict monsters , ( 3 ) compare your points to the `` level '' of the monster , ( 4 ) defeat the monster or attempt to escape ( depending on the results of your points comparison ) .Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play , so each card contains ( often substantial ) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate , but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best . If you stick to those numbers , a game will usually take around 30-45 minutes.This game can be played as a standalone ( apocalypse-themed ) set and is also compatible with any of the ( many ) Munchkin expansions , so a player may consistently add new cards to the deck in order to breathe new life into the game.Overall , the play is very fun , portable , fast-paced , and often amusing . Having said that , these cards were n't as clever as I was hoping . The game is still quite enjoyable , but I was hoping for a few more laughs.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE : Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a `` warm-up '' between their more complicated gaming sessions . It 's a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games ( although Fluxx or Current Number of the Beast are maybe even better for this purpose ) .Finally , this particular set is ( obviously ) apocalypse themed -- in other words , if the player does n't enjoy ( or wo n't understand ) Mad Max and doomsday prepper jokes , you are better off getting a different set of Munchkin cards ( Star Munchkin for sci-fi fans , Conan Munchkin for fantasy fans , etc ) .OVERALL SCORE : B- ( at this point , the game is too venerable to consider anything less , despite the cards not being as humorous as past sets ) ."}, "26550": {"id": "26549", "polarity": "positive", "sentence": "Great game to play with friends .

However unlike Cthulhu , is the uncompromising constant battle , not just against other players , like normal for Munchkin , but also against the game itself.Munchkin turn play summary : & # 34 ; All players are given cards , and can put down items to represent two hands , one pair of feet , one body , and one head . Players can take class and race cards and place them as their character 's skill set.Players kick down the door ( draw a door card face up ) and then deal with the repercussions . If the card is a monster , players must face the monster . If it is a curse , players must resolve the curse . If the player did not encounter a monster , player may then loot the room ( draw a face down door card ) . If the player chooses to not loot the room , they may look for trouble ( take a monster card from their hand and fight it ) .Combat nets players treasures , which can give better weapons , and levels . Players win the game by getting to the tenth level. & # 34 ; In Apocalypse players still draw one card face up , fight the monster , but now items , curses , and monsters can all cause seals to open . Seals are by far some of the most diabolical game play dynamics Munchkin has come up with for some time . Every open seal gives each monster a plus one , but on top of that , lots of them have effects that give much more destructive effects . Worse then the Dungeon cards of Munchkin , the Seals of Apocalypse can severely devastate a player.Whats worse is , that while that 's only one effect , the game instantly ends at 7 seals . Leaving all the Munchkins to fend for themselves against the full wrath of the apocalypse . All the gold , levels and social pandering for naught . The only thing that can save the Munchkins , is their horded stuff . The player with the highest combat strength ( levels not included ) wins the day.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME : I love the seals , the fact that items and and monsters can open them . I like how certain classes can sacrifice to close seals.The game plays amazingly , and works in the seals to a perfect degree.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME : I do n't like the difficulty of this game . While it is slated to allow for beginners , it falls short where other Munchkin games do not . This is not the first game I would play with a beginner Munchkin Player , but eventually they will play it and love it.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR ? Games make by gamers for gamers .

The catch is that when there are 7 seals open , the game ends and the most powerful munchkin ( not highest level ) wins the game . The down side of this rule is you may have someone playing that is purposely opening as many seals as possible because he has a ton of items in use . ... but that is very munchkinly and kind of the object of the game .

In addition to the Brick Mill you get a small front-end loader and a play mat . The brick mill rolls out a continuous tape of bricks that can be press cut at the bottom . In practice it does n't quite work as well as you would hope . The bricks are produced by turning a small crank and turning two small wheels that press out the bricks . Small children may have trouble in both turning the crank and turning the crank in the correct direction . The other challenge is that the bricks have a tendency to roll-up the rolls instead of coming out straight . Not a big deal , but it require some adult observation.Notes -- In addition to the Brick Mill a small front-end loader is also included . The front-end loader both rolls and has the ability to lift its scoop ! - The sides of the Brick Mill include a series of molds so that you can make a variety of brick shapes.- Minimal accessories which , for me , is great because it means fewer things that will be lost ! - Even though it is brick mill it really is easy to clean- The mat is a glorified advertisement - one side is an advertisement while the other side is a nice road scene for moving and transporting the bricks.Final Verdict - The Play Doh Diggin RIgs Tonka Chuck Brick Mill is a nice starting block for any Play Doh Diggin Rigs construction set .

Your child CAN play with is on it 's own as a stand alone toy . In fact , our guy would have been happy to just keep playing with the set as is since the larger truck opens up and and has a cool place to slide the little blonde action figure into the Optimus Prime figure in his `` Truck Formation '' so he and Optimus can drive the Rescue Vehicle together . If you add a few other sets to your inventory , there are other command stations for more figures to man when the truck is opened up as an Emergency Center.We 've had this for many months now and the only things that are showing any wear and tear are the stickers and that 's simply due to the fact that they have been peeled off and re-applies a few times - such are the whims of children ! Other than that all we 've had to replace arworn out batteries . The set comes with 2 Double A ( AA ) Alkaline batteries and it was only recently that we had to replace them . Make sure you always replaces with Alkaline batteries and not batteries labeled `` Heavy Duty '' because those are the type that corrode . Stay with the Alkaline to be safe.As with the other sets , The majority of play seems to be with just the Optimus Prime Truck/Figure and the little man action figure . Those are the real draw for Transfomer fan kids ( as well as adults ! ) But now that we have the other sets , when other kids his age are over for a visit , they drag them all out and have a real heavy duty play session with the larger trucks and the Police Headquarters set as well as Bumblebee . Our child played with this set only for weeks and did n't tire of it so I would say that the add-ons are purely your choice . We added them on because the prices were very reasonable and our guy was anxious to have more pieces in the series to interact with the one he had.I agree with other reviewers who suggest that age of 3 is a little young for this toy and that the upper limit of 7 might be pushing it unles your kid is way into Transformers and imaginative play . When you start pushing uppwards of 7 and 8 , there are whole new sectors of Transformer toys available including Lego sets and more complex ( and expensive ) figures .

For an older kids toy this might be a feature as kids love stickers but for the toddler set this is designed it means work for mom or dad . * Optimus Prime . I LOVE Optimus , but I have to admit that he is n't in the show so including him feels a tad out of place . ( Yes , a very minor complaint I admit . ) *Price - my biggest con , the $ 40 MSRP seems high for what you get.Summary : This is a fun set that is doubly fun for fans of the show with my only serious complaint being the suggested retail price .

Reviews I have read implied that the game was somewhat of a cross between D & D ; 4th edition and Betrayal at House on the Hill ( an excellent cooperative game with multiple scenarios ) . I really wanted to like this game . Though not a fan of D & D ; 4th edition , I did consider that ruleset would make a great boardgame . Sadly , I found this game to be severely lacking.The way the game is structured , you have a scenario with a win condition known at the start of the game ( the sessions I played were an escort mission , and a quest to kill a dracolich ) . Players then take turns moving and exploring , with player turns working much like D & D ; turns . The exploration system is my primary problem with the game . You go to the edge of the board , and lay down a random tile . Every tile has a monster , and every monster immediately attacks the character . There is no opportunity for reaction , tactics , etc . There are several reasons why this is problematic.D & D ; characters have strengths and weaknesses . Take , for example , the wizard . A wizard 's strength is being able to attacks enemies from afar , often multiple ones . Their weakness is typically lack of ability to take damage , represented by a low hit point total . Castle Ravenloft 's Exploration/Encounter system heavily penalizes the wizard character for having fewer hit points than the other characters . We came to realize that this character was just not viable for playing.Another weakness is the Exploration/Encounter system , as I mentioned before . Every exploration reveals an enemy . And while it is nice that all players cooperate , the tactics they use largely make them feel the same.Another game that occupies this same conceptual space is Descent . Also a dungeon crawl game , Descent has one player operate as the Overlord , controlling the monsters . Its gameplay is smoother and more satisfying , but it does not play so quickly . A better horror exploration game that plays in a similar amount of time is Betrayal at House on the Hill ( mentioned earlier ) . Primarily cooperative , it uses a traitor mechanic that causes one player to unexpectedly betray the party , which sets into motion a story-driven scenario , where both the traitor and the rest of the players have distinct win conditions.To sum up , this is not a good game . There are planty of other good cooperative games to measure this against . The poorly-conceived systems diminish its playability , and its small number of scenarios limit its replayability .

I 'm a massive fan of the series and the movies as well . And I saw so many good reviews that I did n't hesitate to buy this game . Unfortunately I 'm not sure what all the five star reviews are for . Maybe because the game is so thematically beautiful . It really is . Oh well , let 's get to breaking it all down.Theme : 5 Stars . They 100 % nailed the theme here . All of the , & # 34 ; oh yeah ! I remember that episode ! & # 34 ; moments are here . And it 's fun to relive them . Also they balanced the characters very well . Mal is great at fighting challenges and even can hold his own when it comes to persuasion . Also I love the way they handled companions in the game too . Very well designed ! Mechanics : 4 stars . This is a solid hit too . They have different decks you buy from when you head to a certain place , like Silverhold or Athens . Also there are different job givers ( good old Badger ) spread across the board as well . Do legal jobs , and you do n't incur any danger . But you also make almost no money . Do illegal or immoral jobs for a high payout ! Also there are two decks you have to flip cards from when you are flying in either Alliance or Border space . Good mechanic because it allows for all the danger of navigating the black to show through.Gameplay : 0 Stars . And here is where the game comes to a 'monkeys must be loose in the engine room ' halt . The designers say the game is sandbox style . Go anywhere . Do anything you want . Sure . And loose while other people just do the exact strategy to win . First game we played , I was surprised at how few turns it took for someone to win the game . He got 3 delivery jobs . Did some muck work , and paid Niska . Wham , bam , thank you maam . Kiss your dear fluffy lord goodbye . Ok , maybe that was a fluke . Game 2 . Almost the same results . But this time with a different player . We even tried to stop him . I flew around in border space till I could get the Reavers on the Hunt card so another buddy of mine could intercept him . Yeah , crew dead , he does n't care . Still pays Niska and wins . Ugh.So maybe that was just a coincidence . We get together another time and play one of the other box scenarios . And I learn how to break the game and win every time . Do you want to know how to do it ? Seriously , in the next couple sentences I will spoil the game for you , and give you the secret to winning . Are you sure you want to know ? Yes ? Yes ? SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Go to either Badger or Amnon Duul and consider jobs , do crap work ( collect $ 200 ) till you get three either delivery jobs , or low misbehave jobs ( 1 card or 2 at the most ! ) . Go hire some crew ( Silverhold is a pretty good place ) . Complete the jobs . Repeat ad nauseam . Lame . But there you go . And yes it does work . Since I discovered that strategy I HAVE N'T LOST A GAME ! And I played with new and seasoned players . That is the biggest letdown in the world.Also some of our other players were really frustrated by the fact that all it takes is one lousy card to completely wreck your game . Hit the card that draws the Reaver or Alliance ship to you , and by the draw of one stupid card you can straight up loose ! Another annoyance , Niska jobs suck ! Sure they pay a lot . But they take a very varied skill set crew or you wo n't be able to beat all the misbehave cards you will have to draw . Also you do n't make that much more in the long run . Doing the slightly lesser but way less risk jobs is the way to go.I know this review will probably garner me a lot of down votes . But I do n't care . I 'm a huge gamer through and through and I hope to warn other people to avoid this game . Thematically it is brilliant and beautiful . But in the play , it is way less than shiney .

The most frustrating part is the high probability of the other players targeting you every turn ( regardless of which character you pick to play , which can change every turn , but is often easy to figure out who is going to be who ) . If you get targeted , you could lose your turn ( assassin ) , gold ( thief ) , districts ( warlord ) or special ability ( witch ) , none of which is any fun . It makes some characters impossible to choose no matter how much you need their special ability , because you know the other players will target them ( especially the witch from the expansion , who steals their special ability and gets to go first ) . I like competitive strategy games but Citadels was simply too cut-throat for me . The game 's artwork and production values are excellent , except for the gold coins , which are really just unpunched butterscotch-colored buttons and look it . For me , the unpunched buttons were a real letdown after the realistic ( if tiny ) gold coins that came withRio Grande Games Dominion : Seaside . My preference for competitive card games suitable for the whole family would be forDominion , which you can customize to increase or decrease the number of attack cards ( even down to zero if you prefer ) and is never the same game twice . Citadels is always the same boring game , even though you get random district cards and ca n't always be the same character every turn ."}, "26740": {"id": "26739", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "This card game has a few flaws . The cards do not fit in standard card protectors ( have to use some obscure sized protectors ) if you want to lengthen the life of the cards . The game play lacks much if you have played Dominion or any other similar style card game . I think if you have never played Dominion it might be a really fun game , but after having played dominion or any other similar game , this game just feels shallow . Game play becomes predictable quickly in small groups and is only made slightly better by adding more players . Replay value is low at best since there are no expansions or different occupations to mix in and out of the game . Save your money and learn a card game with more variety ."}, "26741": {"id": "26740", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "First of all , I always wanted to play this game and was thrilled when a member of our game night group decided to purchase and learn how to play it , as to teach the rest of us . That is the only positive thing I can say about the experience . We played a competitive game with 7 people , and all I can say was that after the first hour of 5 and 1/2 hours of play most of us were trying to figure out how to kill our characters off so we could stop the game and lose . Unfortunately , like the horror that it is , it will not let you do that because the weaker you get , the weaker the games monsters get . I do n't know if that is an intentional mechanic of the game or just the way it turned out for our play , but it seems the game is determined to make you go through the hell of playing for the entire night and most of the next morning just to get it over with . We started at 9 p.m. and did not finish ( and we actually beat the game mind you ) until 4 a.m. the next morning ; and remember we already had a person who knew how to play leading us through , so it was not like we spent hours setting up and getting started , that actually only took about 45 min . ( which , is in my opinion a deal breaker for any game , set up should be easy and take no more than 5-10 min. , max , if you know how to play , 20-30 min . max for first time ) , the rule book alone is almost 30 pages long and do n't expect a quick start or `` idiots '' guide to help it get moving , cuz there aint one . This game is so convoluted and without plot that building any kind of strategy is pointless , and there is no real storyline to get into or pass the time . Most of the time , whenever you do face something , it will knock you down to almost nothing before you even get a chance to fight it , so you are unlikely to be successful , most of the locations on the game require funds and achievements that take hours to get in order to get what the site offers . The mechanics are so flawed/boring that most of the time the players are sitting in the `` Nether Regions '' twiddling their thumbs for 30-45 minutes ( usually two or more rounds ) , waiting to get to do something because their character has been `` KO 'd '' or they are attempting to close a gate . The end was very anti-climatic and occurred with little action or fan fair . If you think this game looks like fun I would suggest finding someone else who has it and play it with them first before you spend the money , or purchase A Touch of Evil from Flying Frogs productions which is this same basic game with all of the stupid , repetitive , boring , pointless , convolutions and bad mechanics removed and therefor much more fun to play and far less time consuming . I mean really , 5.5 hours ? I would not want to play my favorite game of all time ( which is a Flying Frog game by the way , Fortune and Glory ) for 5.5 hours . The board in this game is too large and the writing is too small , so you spend half the night standing up looking over the shoulder of your fellow gamers , trying to read what occurs at each location , to figure out if it is worth traveling to that site . The board is also very non-descript and unattractive and you better have a very large table to play it on because there is a lot of crap that needs to be on the table at one time for this game , I can not even imagine how large and drug out the expansions for this game would make it . Again , my advice would be let someone else sport the bill for this one and play with them or get A Touch of Evil instead if you want a fun night of gaming . But , if you enjoy wishing you could have the last 5.5 hours of your life back after the fact , and I guess there is some Lovecraftian masochism to that , than by all means ignore my recommendation and purchase this game . If you are a diehard Lovecraft fan and just love anything that has to do with the Cthulhu mythos , no matter how entertaining it is , or is n't , than I suppose you might like this game ; only one person in our group falls into the category of that big of Lovecraft fan , so we do not . As a last thought , just to let you know , our group is a hardcore gaming group , that plays everything from D & D to Clue , so it is not the fact that we are not up to games of this magnitude , in fact we love convoluted and complicated , as long as it is fun and has a purpose beyond just being convoluted and complicated , this game is and does neither ."}, "26742": {"id": "26741", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I initially enjoyed playing this game due to the co-op nature and how intriguing/random it is but as I 've played it more and more , I 've begun to dislike it more and more . There is so much happening with the game but the payoff is rarely worth it . I 'll play it if my group is playing it but otherwise , I want nothing to do with it.Basic Play - You select a character , your choice or at random , and get all equipment/money they are entitled to . Select a random Ancient One to battle . You spend the rest of the game navigating the board looking for clues , buying items , getting skills/spells/allies , fighting enemies and going into portals to close/seal them . Your character card has stats you can change at the beginning of every turn . For example , you can increase your ability to move around the board faster but this decreases your ability to sneak past enemies . You can increase your luck but this decreases your lore . Each character has their own individual max/minimums for each stat , starting stuff , and special ability that makes them unique . Almost everything you do in this game will be done with dice . Rolling a 5 or 6 is a success while a 1-4 is a fail . You might enter a room and have to make a luck check , so you 'll see what your character 's luck rating is and get that many dice to roll . One 5 or 6 and you 're good but if you get none than you fail . There are cards and other things that can modify your abilities . Enemies require that you do all damage at once to kill them . So if an enemy has 3 life and you get 2 hits , he takes no damage and hits you and next round you will have to get 3 hits still to kill it . You ca n't team up in combat with another player , even though this is a co-op game , to kill an enemy . All battles are one on one , except the final battle , if it happens . If you die at any point in the game , you simply re-spawn and lose half your items . It is possible to be devoured , in which case your character is permanently dead and you select a new character and come back onto the board with all their starting stuff ( it is often better to be devoured then killed ) . There are a ton of locations to visit in the game , all of them have a set of 7 cards that you pick one from at random to see what happens to you . Some locations have special text on them where you can choose to do what the text says rather than draw a random card , such as the item shops or medical areas . All players will go and then at the end of every round , a portal gate will open , if possible , and bring out monsters , if possible , and make monsters move , if possible . You win the game if you close all gates ( certain restrictions apply ) , seal 6 or more gates ( by using 5 clue tokens or a special item ) , or kill the ancient one if he awakens . You lose if the ancient one awakens ( which can happen multiple ways ) and you fail to defeat him.Components - This game just has way too many pieces . The board is huge , you will need a large table to play this on , especially if you get any of the expansions that make the board even larger . The board itself is nice to look at and well made . There are 16 large character cards and 8 ancient one cards to select from each game . They look nice and have unique stories for each of the characters on the back . There are 196 token pieces , 189 different cards your characters can acquire ( split into 11 piles ) , 179 ancient one cards ( split into 3 piles , the location pile will be split into 9 different piles ) , 60 monster tokens , 16 gate tokens and at least 30 more random tokens/markers/dice . On the plus side , everything looks nice and it 's unlikely anything will get worn out or damaged . On the negative side , you need a ton of room to place all this stuff , and then you need more room for each person playing the game . Also , the cards your characters can acquire are the smaller , annoying , hard to shuffle style of cards ( such as Ticket to Rides train car cards ) . The rulebook is large and it is 24 pages . It is somewhat rough to get through and you 'll have to check back multiple times during your first couple playthroughs , probably even in some later playthroughs . There are no gameplay sheets to hand out to players , which you 'll want and need , so make sure you go online and find a friendly gameplay sheet to print out for players , you can find them at BoardGameGeek . The insert for the game is ok . I do n't think they provided any baggies so you 'll want to get some to put all the different pieces in.Length - This game takes a long time , especially your first couple playthroughs . Expect setup to take you about 15-30 minutes since you have to select characters , enemies , distribute starting items/cash/skills/life/sanity/etc , then you have to shuffle each deck of cards , play a starting mythos card and place the gate and enemies . The actual game itself will run at least 4 hours for your initial play-through . It still regularly takes my group 2 1/2 - 3 hours to play a game . I 'm the guy that actually keeps the game moving because I want to get through it . They tried playing it once without me and it took them over 5 hours because they could n't stay focused.Re-playability - This is one of the big positives of the game . There is a lot of re-playability due to all the characters , ancients ones ( that have various effects on monsters and gameplay ) , and just the random nature of the game . Game win/loss conditions change depending on the number of players , along with how many monster spawns and other various rules.Luck - Almost everything you do in this game requires you to roll dice . There is a ton of luck . I 've watched 11 dice come up with no successes and 3 dice get 3 successes . Every location card you draw has something random happen at the location that could be good or bad . You might have your lore skill maxed out ( which leaves you with little to no luck ) and draw a helpful/hurtful card that requires lore to pass . Of course , you might draw a card that requires luck to pass and you do n't get to roll at all if you have no luck . Also , most cards take a die or two away from whatever skill check you are making . Monsters only move if the mythos card drawn at the end of each turn say so . So if you go into a room and a monster blocks the exit , you have to either fight or sneak past . Some monsters are extremely difficult to kill and some are difficult to sneak past , some have both . So if one of those tough to sneak/fight monsters is blocking your room , enjoy being stuck in there for the next couple turns . There are also random cards that just cause you to die/get devoured , so enjoy that as well.Interaction - There is surprisingly little interaction needed for this game . You might give someone an item once a game or use a special power to help someone but for the most part , everyone just kind of does there own thing . You ca n't team up to fight monsters or close/seal gates . Most of the interaction will just be game banter.Thoughts pros - Hard to think of a lot at this point . There is a ton of theme . Can play 1-8 players . Components are all good quality and look nice . A lot of things you can do , characters and bad guys to pick . The co-operative aspect is nice , I guess.Thoughts cons - Can someone show me where the fun is ? It takes a while to slog thorough and is just way to random . It 's rough to teach to new players , you 're better off just playing and hoping they pick up as they go along . The rules are annoying to remember . There are many rules that change depending on the number of people playing , so you have to look those up each game . Even after many playthroughs , using cheat sheets , I 'm pretty sure we still have a rule or two wrong . The co-op aspect is n't really used that often . Occasionally someone will give an item away but most of the time it 's just spent deciding which gate someone is going to go into . Everyone pretty much just does their own thing ; and I 've sat in one location for the majority of the game doing nothing and we still win most of the time . I 've also found that there is very little strategy required . The game gives you all of these options but I 've found it breaks down to 4 different things . 1 . If you have 5 clues or the item that seals a gate , go into a gate . 2 . If you ca n't close a gate and have money , go to the special item store and try to buy the item that automatically seals a gate ( I think there are 3 or 4 of them in the special item deck ) . 3 . If you have no money , run around and pick up clues . 4 . If you have no money and there are no clues , just sit in a room where you have a good shot at earning clues/money . For example , of the 7 cards for the newspaper location , some give you money with no rolling , some give a luck ( -1 ) check for a clue and one gives you a lore ( -1 ) check for 3 clues . So you just sit in that room and earn money or clues and then use whatever you earned . Using this strategy , I 've only lost 2 of about 10+ we 've played . There have been a couple last turn thrillers where we won , but other than that , not much fun here . There are some locations that have almost no purpose . It is extremely rare that someone goes to the common item shop and buys a common item , or goes to the magic shop to buy magic , or goes to the skill area to buy a skill . You 're better off just trying to draw the special item that lets you seal a gate . Some location cards wo n't be drawn because there is no purpose to going there , I 've never seen anyone draw a location card for the hospital , magic shop , common item shop , church , boarding house or curiositie shoppe . There is no reason to visit these spots outside of their special text options . Certain mythos cards have text on them titled `` environment '' that cause effects that alter the game ( all players get +1 luck/-1 lore , or no spells can be cast , etc ) and these can be annoying to remember sometimes . Combat also is n't that interesting . Most of the time , your character will fit one of two molds , decked out for combat or do n't bother fighting anything that has more than one life . Also , enemies are very uneven , there only seem to be 2 difficulties , ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard . There are very few that fall in between . You 'll probably have one player who just runs around killing enemies . Sometimes you 'll let yourself get killed or get devoured because it 's beneficial . I should n't get rewarded for dying.I was n't sure whether I wanted to give this a 3 or 2 stars , but what decided it for me was that I 'll enjoy playing a 3 star game once and a while , but this game , I just want it to be over as soon as possible . I do n't like Pandemic , but I will play that over this any time . This game just takes too long to setup ( I 'd rather setup Axis & Allies ) and play for the little payoff it gives and there are too many cards/pieces . I do n't mind longer games but there needs to be entertainment or a payoff in the gameplay and there is neither in this game . The game is n't hard , it 's just random . Everything is too random and you 're at the mercy of the dice . There is next to no strategy or thinking required , you just hope something random does n't happen to screw you . There are too many fiddly rules and too many pieces to fiddle with , even some monsters have to be removed from the group of monsters because they 're only used if a specific ancient one is in play . You 've got to remember what special power the ancient one gives enemies plus environments and events . People that love this game seem to love it for the theme . I guess that 's ok , but for me , theme , presentation etc ... mean very little if the core gameplay is n't good . I 'd much rather play generic themed game with ugly looking components that has interesting/good gameplay than this game . There is just nowhere near enough good things about this game to make up for the many negatives of the game . I think I 'd rather play Risk than this game . At least I can spread myself thin in Risk and get killed to end the suffering , this just goes on and on . I 'm tired of playing this game , I 'm either not going to play it from now on or just play my 3DS or read a book while playing , at least then I 'll feel like I 'm doing something entertaining . Overall , I have to give this game a 3/10 ."}, "26743": {"id": "26742", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I had great expectations from all the position 4 and 5 star reviews of this game .

She is what some would call a `` reluctant gamer '' whereas I am an avid gamer , so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to . She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck ( i.e. , not all strategy ) and are n't too complex ( i.e. , where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two ) , whereas I love strategy and complexity but do n't mind a little luck . We also like games you can finish in a single session ( or games you can play multiple times in a single session ) This game fit the bill perfectly.Based on what I 've read about this game on Amazon and BoardGameGeek this one seemed like a real contender . And , there were many things we liked about this game . We liked the theme -- you really feel like you are going on a journey ( and that you got to play familiar characters and see lots of familiar faces and places along the way ) , the fact that it is cooperative , and the fact that we had n't played anything quite like it before . And , I know lots of other people enjoy the game , and I by no means mean any disrespect to them by giving it a two star rating.But , after playing it twice with her ( and a third time with two gamer friends ) , we all felt the exact same way ... it just did n't feel very enjoyable to us . Most of the game play was good but not great ( probably 3.5 stars ) , but the ending was main problem . After all your hard work ( and assuming you are lucky enough to get to the end in the first place ) , whether you win or lose often comes down to a simple dice roll . This was very anticlimactic . No game should end that way.Given that there are also ways to lose along the way ( in fact , it is quite possible you 'll never get to the end ... which was not a big problem as seeing how far you get each time can be a worthwhile challenge in and of itself ) , it seemed to us that if you get to the end something besides a random dice roll should determine the outcome of the game . At best ( if things went very well along the way ) , you may get to make multiple dice rolls which can increase your chances of winning .

I heard it was one of the best in it 's class and have always loved the Fantasy theme especially in board/card games , so I bought it . ( Side note : I played the regular rules and then the Tom Vasel `` Epic Thunderstone '' rules as well . ) I guess now after other complex card games have come out , it 's easy to be down or negative on this historical game . For it was the 3rd game to come out in this genre as a `` deck-builder '' type game and still be different from classic , popular and all powerful Magic the Gathering card game.What is nice is that you do n't have to take out a large loan to buy this game ( like Magic ) . Instead it has a rather large amount of cards right in the box ready to be played . I do enjoy fantasy based games and video games so I was hoping this would fit my desires , but sadly this game falls incredibly flat.Quality : The cards have a nice raised textured pattern to them and fairly thick . The box is thick with a very nice insert to help you organize the cards . It all has a nice quality and will probably stand up over time . My only concern here is , much of the cards are surrounded by black ink and if you scratch or `` nick '' the cards , it is very visible ( and does n't look good ) .Art/Graphics : I have listened to other game reviews `` rave '' about the art , and until recent expansions of this game , I do not agree with the others . I do not like the art ( especially the base set ) and think it is n't up to the standards of the rest of the gaming world . Some cards they are down-right comical . Not to mention some of the art does not match and looks like another game entirely and very different styled artists were employed to create it.Price/Value : This game is very overpriced . For the amount of cards you get and the thickness of the box and it 's nice insert , it 's more worth $ 20-30 , but not the asking price.Base mechanics : Basically deck building games imply that you are BUILDING your hand in order to be able to do actions on your turn ( e.g . slay a monster or buy a good weapon ) . In many other games ( such as the video game World of Warcraft or Skyrim ) you can customize your character in order to be successful at your deeds . Collecting weapons and `` heroes '' , only serve to give you attack points or buying points . For a hero really is n't a HERO in Thunderstone . This hero is just a number on a card with some art . You could have pasted a factory worker on the card trying to repair a broken down assembly line , because the theme and actions seem completely `` pasted on '' .On your turn , you use 6 cards in your hand to do buying or attacking ... that 's it . If you do n't have the right cards drawn on your turn , you may or may not do anything . However , simply to the point , the game ends up being is a `` gathering card '' game . As soon as you see your opponent killing monsters ( and getting victory points in the process ) it 's a sprint for the finish line . It does n't feel like a game , and at times the game felt like it was playing me . Thunderstone has very little strategy and much too much chance/luck involved . Thunderstone seems like an advanced version of Dominion which is a hugely boring game to me.To End : I should try and sell mine on Ebay where I 'd get a great price for it . But I am probably going to keep it for those friends who want a think-less non-complicated game . Thunderstone is so flat and `` outright nothingness '' to it 's core mechanics , that I am incredibly surprised this game is so popular . There is so many better games out there , that you would be better off with another one of them . For example , Lord of the Rings Living Card Game and/or Mage Knight are similar in theme and both are card games , yet they both have real consequences to what you do and real strategy that require you to think things through and make good decisions.In the end , `` to each his own '' , and this game does n't appeal to me or involve `` fun '' . However , do n't take my word for it , be very careful and watch some youtube videos on how it 's played before you buy ... you 'll be glad you did the extra research ."}, "26750": {"id": "26749", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I installed fresh batteries in the robot and started it up .

The Second Edition board had pictures of characters on each space . It was rather attactive . Magical Moments on the other hand simply has blank spaces and a few random ( and they are quite random ) characters thrown on the board . Also gone are the double move spaces , which is sort of inexplicable . The Buzz cards are now retangular instead of circular and do n't fit as nicely on the board .

Unfortunately , the first roller had moved three quarters of the way around the board before getting a question wrong .

Not a lot , because I 'm busy , but I do have a good time flying . That infrequency plays a part in the problem , I think.First , the good part : This thing is really durable and super easy to fly . If you 've never flown an RC helicopter before , this is a good place to start . You can crash it and it wo n't break ; you can fly fairly erratically and it is easy to remain in control . That part is awesome.The part that is n't awesome is the `` no lift '' problem . If you go out and search for `` syma 107 no lift '' you 'll see tons of forums and articles talking about it . There 's even an Amazon discussion on this product about having no lift . For me , I think the problem stems from how difficult the battery is to maintain . It'sa tiny LiPo battery . LiPo batteries are pretty notoriously finicky about how you use them in comparison to NiMH or other batteries you might see in larger units.My first helicopter was great for about six months , then I went to fly it and at full throttle the blades would spin but I 'd get no lift . I took the whole thing apart , lubricated everything , checked the motors and the gears , but no matter what I did - no lift . I boughta replacement batteryand installed it , then charged it up . That did n't last more than a week or so until I again hit the `` no lift '' issue . Bad battery ? Motor problem ? Who knows . I do n't have the equipment to measure battery voltages and discharge rates ... and for the price , I 'm not sure I should HAVE to.At that point I bought a second one of these , since they 're not too expensive . I figured , worst case , I could use the first one as spare parts for the second if I needed to . That was four months ago , and this morning I fired up the heli and got about 10 seconds of lift , then ... done . Spinning blades , down on the table , no lift.Some of the articles out there will tell you this magic formula : Wait five minutes after charging before you fly ; only fly for a max of five minutes ; wait five minutes after you 're done flying before charging . I could n't tell you if that works since I found it long after this second one died.If I have time , which I probably wo n't , I may try to combine the two choppers into one functional unit , maybe with ( yet another ) new battery . That said , with the relative prices of batteries to the actual helicopter , you buy three or four batteries and you 've almost bought a whole new helicopter.Anyway , take good care of your battery and your helicopter will probably last a long time . Mine ( both ) did n't , so this gets two stars overall .

The first problem you will discover is the extremely short flight time . The flight time is 5 to 10 minutes for a brand new copter . The second problem is it does n't take very long to damage them to the point where repairs are needed . If you do n't damage it then you will find out that the battery life dies of pretty quickly . You will find that after you have flown it for several days that the flight time is getting shorter and shorter.It is educational because you will can get a lot of experience in how to repair RC Helicopters with the S107G . This model is repairable and parts are readily available . It does take good dexterity , mechanical ability , and good eyesight or reading glasses . When the batteries go bad , which is frequently , you can unscrew the cowling , pull the battery , cut the wires , trim the wires that remain and cut and trim the wires on the replacement battery . Then you get to solder the wires together and insulate them with tape . Yes you got the idea , no plugable battery connections , just a PIA POS that you have to solder in place . It IS VERY educational.I recommend bypassing the education by getting one and sending it back after it breaks which is usually two weeks or less if you fly it every day .

Totally ridiculous . Do n't waste your money . Go to eBay and get the real thing.As everyone else has probably explained , the original characters from the 80 's are gone . This alone would n't invoke such an awful rating . The problem is they were replaced with extremely intense pictures which are so detailed and huge , that the path has been narrowed and now winds through some new places ( so it is longer and thinner ) . To be honest , I even missed the secret path when I landed on it because the game board is so busy , you ca n't really see where it starts . The enlarged gingerbread men ( and I thought the Katy Perry video totally mocked them , uh yeah - they are fairly accurate in terms of these new creepy ones ) do n't even fit on the micro-spaces that comprise the path . Because the path winds around itself so many times , it is hard to follow , knock your guy an inch and suddenly you are in the next loop of the path and have jumped ahead dramatically . It now takes about double the time to play a game , in part because the path is much longer - but also because the board is harder to follow . It seems it was designed with a deranged teenage girl in mind , not three year olds . You would think they would test these products and do a side-by-side with kids comparing the new one to the old one - hands down , the original would have won.Unfortunately , this is pretty much the only board game for 3 year olds and now it is rendered useless . By the time your child has the dexterity to move his/her piece along this narrow , windy path without being distracted by all the crazy graphics - he or she will realize how babyish this game is and will have moved along to something more challenging.I did actually write to Hasboro directly regarding the above issues , though I doubt they will ever respond ."}, "26807": {"id": "26806", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "I had fond memories of playing this game growing up , so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas .

( My young nieces , for example , *will* ask a lot for Candyland - but only because I am not willing to play it with them very often . ) Some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children , and that 's probably true , but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around , and they know that . I have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like Sleeping Queens or Crazy Eights that I have in Candyland - and , tellingly , when my older niece loses Crazy Eights she pouts and then asks to play again . When she loses Candyland , she pouts and puts the game away ! Some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game . But I do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.Instead of Candyland , I 'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - Memory , or Froggy Boogie , perhaps.There is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.Edit : I 've found out why my niece likes this game at all .

Move in straight lines back and forth on a mostly featureless board counting up to 100 as you spin a spinner and hope against hope that you get to climb a ladder and avoide a `` chute '' ( which is actually a slide ) .I suppose it 's great if you want to teach a child to count to 100 and keep playing at reaching a goal no matter how much bad luck befalls him or her , but Candyland can do that ( well , not the 100 part but the goal part , and the kids do n't need to know how to count to 100 ) and it 's a lot more fun.The other adults ( my wife and a friend ) that I mention this game to both remember playing it as a child and changing the rules just so the game will finally end .

Offering strategic elements of chess on a familiar board game motif , it became a very popular game in American households during the 1960s and 70s . By 2000 , no doubt caving to constant reports of how stupid American children were becoming , Hasbro changed the numbering system on the pieces , completely inverting the familiar 1-9 scale . Historically , the most powerful piece ( Marshall ) was marked `` 1 '' while the least powerful piece ( Scout ) was marked `` 9 . '' More recent editions contain pieces marked in the opposite manner , with higher ranked ( i.e. , stronger ) pieces displaying higher numbers . This decision was not met with universal applause , and in response ( or perhaps it was planned all along to generate multiple streams of revenue ? ) , Hasbro released a `` Vintage '' edition . So if you wish to own the same Stratego game you grew up playing , you are forced to find an older game or else purchase the more expensive Vintage edition . Another pitfall for would-be buyers is that Hasbro recently capitalized on the popular fantasy theme , releasing a version of Stratego which replaces the classic Napoleonic army with medieval themed pieces ( i.e. , dragon , dwarf , slayer ) . Confusingly , this version is NOT named Stratego -- the D & D ; Battle or Stratego -- the Fire and Ice Edition or any other moniker that might be helpful in distinguishing among them . Note also that this version also reduced the number of pieces from forty to thirty.To recap , there are three current Hasbro ( Milton Bradley ) offerings . They are all offered on Amazon ( at varying price levels ) and I will cross reference the manufacturer 's part numbers and also provide the relevant links to the games on Hasbro 's Web site , although you can not purchase directly there.====================================================Stratego NostalgiaHasbro Item # 40836 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The Vintage edition ( confusingly titled `` Nostalgia '' by Amazon ) offers the proper ( in my opinion ! ) numbering system , and comes in a keepsake wooden box.====================================================Stratego-Milton Bradley Board GamesHasbro Item # 04714 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The basic Stratego ( post-2000 ) edition offers the proper number of pieces ( 40 ) but the inverted ranking system . This last and most important point is not obvious until you scrutinize the Product Details . ( `` This new , updated version of Stratego is slightly different than the original , though the gameplay is the same . '' ) Plus you need to apply the stickers yourself ! Ouch , Hasbro cheaped out.====================================================StrategoHasbro Item # 45068 ( See Comments section below for link . ) The fantasy-themed version with 30 pieces . Again , Amazon has failed to adequately label the game , simply titling it `` Stratego . '' However the Product Features make it clear . ( `` Choose to lead warriors from an ancient arctic realm or a fierce army from a land of fiery molten lava . `` ) ====================================================Your best bet ? If you simply want the same game you grew up playing , just look for a cardboard boxed set from the 70s or 80s . For example , this version ( Stratego - The Classic Game of Battlefield Strategy 1986 Edition ) is the same one I have . I have owned it for many years with no complaints . Finding one for yourself , however , might be trickier than you think . Unless you buy it here from a Amazon Marketplace vendor -- which is not recommended , given the ridiculous prices -- you are left to your own devices to find it in a used game store or at a garage sale . Alternatively , you can buy one of the currently offered versions . But as I have demonstrated , they are not all the same as one another , and indeed very few are identical to what you may have grown up playing.P.S . After much further research , I believe either of these two sets ( Stratego Vintage Wood Book Edition ) or ( Library Stratego Game Set ) are equivalent to the Vintage edition described above , and at least one may be available inexpensively at Target ."}, "26834": {"id": "26833", "polarity": "negative", "sentence": "Half the reviews for this product are 5 star , half are 1 star .

While it is about double the price , it is the game you know and love . The less expensive version ( reviewed here ) is a piece of garbage.I regret this purchase . If you grew up playing Monopoly , you would be much , much better off buying `` classic '' or a used version . There are several major issues with this version , as well as some minor ones . If you buy this to teach your children one of the most beloved games of your childhood and a part of Americana , you are apt to be disappointed.The major issues involve quality and design . The board itself no longer folds in two . It is cut to fold into quarters and barely sits level on a table . I do not hold out much hope it will last very long . The property cards are flimsy , made smaller than in the past , as well as being thinner . The Chance and Community Chest cards are also of poor quality , much thinner than their predecessors , and take on color changes , now being blue/white and orange/white , instead of the familiar yellow and orange , respectively.The money is a big concern as well . The money is thin and there are not enough slots provided to use money in the bank during play , or to store after gameplay , and in fact there are raised areas in the plastic money tray which prevent the money from even sitting in the spaces . The raised areas are somewhat random and follow no logical pattern . So forget using the box/tray component for the bank during a game or storing money neatly . The tray is essentially useless . I have no idea what Hasbro/Parker Brothers was thinking here , and apparently neither did they.The minor issues are some game changes : The money is different color and handed out in different amounts . Very minor , yes , but now you have to get used to $ 10 being blue ( used to be the $ 50 ) as well as some other color changes . You are also starting the game with different amounts of money . Also the Income Tax space is now a flat $ 200 instead of `` 10 % or $ 200 '' , and Luxury Tax is $ 100 , no longer $ 75 . Again , these are minor but worth noting.I would avoid this cheaply made version . At the very least this should be advertised as what it is - `` revamped Monopoly .

Well , let me help you with that : If you have the money ... then yes . There , decision made . I really do not see how marching your token around the same dull board in the same direction over and over and over again for what could be easily two or even more hours would qualify for anyone as fun .

The difference is that those games have more interesting and varied decisions and planning to be done . You are not the victim of dice . ( Dice are not always bad . There ARE some games out there that utilize dice far better than Monopoly and do manage to tie the outcome of the dice to actual decisions in a more balanced way . ) But Monopoly just does not have anywhere near the mechanic needed to justify a game taking this long . I 've heard enthusiasts say it is a great way for kids to develop their math skills . Even that argument is weak because there are far better games out there that can help with those skills . I would suggest Ticket To Ride for starters . That is a game that takes about an hour , easy to learn , has some luck involved , but much more planning and decision making to keep it engaging .

It takes maybe 30-60 seconds of `` set up '' time to play a 2-4 minute game . While this isnt the end of the world , I personally find it quite annoying.Here is how the game works : there are around 30 or 40 faces in the game . Each player randomly picks one card from the 40 . Each player has a rack which includes cards for all the faces which are turned away from the opposing player so that only you can see the faces in your rack . Each trait ( for example gender ) is split so that there is a minority ( i.e . there are only 6ish female faces , and 6ish black faces , etc ... ) and a majority ( the remaining faces -- i.e . 20+ are male , 20+ are white , etc ... ) . There are around 10 or so traits , all with this majority/minority trend -- gender , race , glasses , hats , bald , facial hair , etc ... Every person seems to have at least one or more minority traits ( i.e . its a man , but he is bald , or wearing a hat . ) You ask a question , ie `` is it a girl '' and , depending on the answer , flip over the boys/girls on your rack to eliminate them , and by process of elimination , and by asking more questions eg `` is the person bald '' work down till there is only one person on your rack , which must be the person the opposing player picked . Whoever gets down to one left on their rack first ( i.e . figures out who the other player picked first ) wins . Getting lucky and picking the right minority trait to ask about is more useful than good logic.I 'm not overly PC or anything , but I just cant warm to a game the whole purpose of which is asking questions designed to exclude people with minority traits , so you can , by process of elimination , figure out who is left.Moreover , the concept is so simple that I dont think the game is very educational . The kids ( even the very young ) quickly learn the basic concept . Once they learn it , there isnt any real learning left to do .

You get it in the mail , you open the box , thrilled to own Scrabble , but then ... . the unthinkable ! ! This ai n't your Grandma 's Scrabble ! ! What they have done , is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it `` deluxe Scrabble '' . PLASTIC . Everything is PLASTIC . The tiles might be wood , I dunno I did n't bite them , but everything else is cheap , thin plastic . Does n't turn nice like the old version . And the biggest kicker of them all , is the board itself . Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table , they would stay put .

This board has been out since the 1990s , and it 's rather sad this is the only model currently available on the market that I know of . The game goes much faster because of how wonky the marble path is around each home colour ( purple , red , etc ) . The board itself is cheaply made and starts comes apart pretty easily . Also , this board is aimed squarely at little kids , and Wahoo is one of those games that adults can play with equal pleasure.I have an Aggravation board from the 1980s , and that board looks so much more stylish . I wish they had that.If you are wanting a good board , do n't get this one . There are plenty of home made wooden boards available on Ebay and other sources . In the past few years I have bought two different wooden boards off Ebay that were dual sided . One side had a four player version and the other side had a six player version for my wife 's grandma who loves Wahoo . I bought a second one from the same vendor a year or two later with an 8 player game on one side and a 4 player game on the second side . The quality of these boards are great , strong , and durable.Trust me , if you like Wahoo/Aggravation , a wooden board is definitely the way to go !
